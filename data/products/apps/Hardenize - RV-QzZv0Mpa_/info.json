	"longDescription": "Hardenize is a comprehensive security tool that continuously monitors the security and configuration of your domain name, email, and website. We focus on modern security standards and best development practices. Here's a selection of the most important acronyms we cover: DNS, DNSSEC, CAA, SMTP, STARTTLS, SPF, DMARC, DANE, HTTP, Cookies, SRI, TLS, PKI, CSP, HSTS, HPKP, and so on. If you know what these are, great! If you don't, also great, because our report will help you understand which ones are important and which ones to deploy.\n\nOur Cloudflare app will show-off your good security to your visitors via a small embedded badge. The badge changes based on the configuration of your web site. By default, everyone gets the standard version. If your site has better than average security, we'll show that to your visitors!\n\nAt this time, if your web site has robust HTTPS (good TLS and PKI configuration, redirection from plaintext to HTTPS, and HSTS with preloading), the badge will show a nice friendly checkmark. To be certain you have everything well configured, visit your simplified report by clicking on the badge itself. If you see four green checkmarks, you're all set. Otherwise, proceed to the full report, which will help you make the necessary improvements. At this time, about 7% of top 500 sites get the tick. You can too!",
	"instructions": "Thanks for trying the Hardenize app! Please note that during the installation we may show you the default badge image (without the tick) even if your web site satisfies all our security requirements. That will happen if we haven't seen your web site before. The correct badge image will show up once we complete our assessment and after the HTTP caches (of the badge image) expire.\n\nIf you're making changes to your site configuration, it may take several days before the badge reflects them. To make this process faster, simply visit our web site and manually re-test your web site.",

At this time, if your web site has robust HTTPS (good TLS and PKI configuration, redirection from plaintext to HTTPS, and HSTS with preloading), the badge will show a nice friendly checkmark. To be certain you have everything well configured, visit your simplified report by clicking on the badge itself. If you see four green checkmarks, you're all set.

Please note that during the installation we may show you the default badge image (without the tick) even if your web site satisfies all our security requirements.

If you're making changes to your site configuration, it may take several days before the badge reflects them. To make this process faster, simply visit our web site and manually re-test your web site.",

			"releaseNotes": "We've completely redesigned our app based on your feedback! The badge is now being embedded into web pages and you can choose the exact location where you want it.\n\nThe badge itself is brand new and not only looks much better, but also changes appearance based on the configuration of your web site. By default, everyone gets the standard badge, but sites with robust HTTPS get a nice checkmark as a bonus.\n\nWe've also completely redesigned the security report (which your visitors can open by clicking on the badge). It now opens in a separate window, showing a report that's much more user friendly and focuses on only four key aspects of HTTPS configuration.",

				"shortDescription": "Comprehensive security report card for your site.",
				"longDescription": "Hardenize is a comprehensive security tool that continuously monitors the security and configuration of your domain name, email, and website. We focus on modern security standards and best development practices. Here's a selection of the most important acronyms we cover: DNS, DNSSEC, CAA, SMTP, STARTTLS, SPF, DMARC, DANE, HTTP, Cookies, SRI, TLS, PKI, CSP, HSTS, HPKP, and so on. If you know what these are, great! If you don't, also great, because our report will help you understand which ones are important and which ones to deploy.\n\nOur Cloudflare app will show-off your good security to your visitors via a small embedded badge. The badge changes based on the configuration of your web site. By default, everyone gets the standard version. If your site has better than average security, we'll show that to your visitors!\n\nAt this time, if your web site has robust HTTPS (good TLS and PKI configuration, redirection from plaintext to HTTPS, and HSTS with preloading), the badge will show a nice friendly checkmark. To be certain you have everything well configured, visit your simplified report by clicking on the badge itself. If you see four green checkmarks, you're all set. Otherwise, proceed to the full report, which will help you make the necessary improvements. At this time, about 7% of top 500 sites get the tick. You can too!",
				"instructions": "Thanks for trying the Hardenize app! Please note that during the installation we may show you the default badge image (without the tick) even if your web site satisfies all our security requirements. That will happen if we haven't seen your web site before. The correct badge image will show up once we complete our assessment and after the HTTP caches (of the badge image) expire.\n\nIf you're making changes to your site configuration, it may take several days before the badge reflects them. To make this process faster, simply visit our web site and manually re-test your web site.",
