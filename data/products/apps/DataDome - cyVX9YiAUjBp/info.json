	"longDescription": "DataDome’s bot and online fraud protection detects and mitigates attacks with unparalleled accuracy and zero compromise. Our machine learning solution analyzes 3 trillion signals per day to adapt to new threats in real time. Our 24/7 SOC experts protect hundreds of high-profile brands worldwide, including Reddit, Patreon, and AngelList. A force multiplier for IT and security teams, DataDome is fully transparent, easy to deploy, and frictionless for consumers. In 2022, DataDome was named a Strong Performer in the Forrester Wave: Bot Management and ranked the top G2 Leader in Bot Detection & Mitigation for Fall 2022.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan. Pricing plans are available on our [website](https://datadome.co/pricing?utm_source=cloudflare_app).",

DataDome’s Artificial Intelligence protects all vulnerability endpoints (web, mobile apps & APIs) with a cutting-edge technology providing real-time automated blocking decisions. \n\n# Real-time dashboard & Custom Rules\nThanks to our state-of-the-art dashboard, users get real-time intuitive notifications about blocked attacks, feedback loops, insights, business KPIs and attack details.\nDataDome’s AI decisions can be monitored and overridden in real time by creating Custom Rules with direct and immediate effect. DataDome analyzes in real time 100% of incoming requests and provides automated threat detection, categorization by types and dedicated responses for every single hit. With a bad bot false positive ratio under 0,01%, legitimate users and search engines will never be blocked by our artificial intelligence module.\n\n#Integration\nDataDome integrates seamlessly, in less than an hour, with 95% of the world’s web infrastructure (both client & server sides) and does not require any change to existing architectures. Our technology runs anywhere, in any cloud, with a positive impact on websites and mobile applications' performance.\n\n#Model\nDataDome is the only bot blocking solution available in full SaaS mode, protecting thousands of domains and applications in more than 60 countries, with both pricing plans and technical documentation (incl. modules' source code) publicly available online.\n\n#The DataDome App\nThis app enables to set-up the DataDome protection on Cloudflare sites. It makes a call to the closest DataDome endpoint. Depending on the API response, the app either blocks the request or lets Cloudflare continue the regular process.\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.",

DataDome offers real-time AI protection against all OWASP automated threats, including credential stuffing, layer 7 DDoS attacks, SQL injection & intensive scraping.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan.

DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website.

DataDome offers real-time AI protection against all OWASP automated threats, including credential stuffing, layer 7 DDoS attacks, SQL injection & intensive scraping.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks.

DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website.

DataDome offers real-time AI protection against all OWASP automated threats, including credential stuffing, layer 7 DDoS attacks, SQL injection & intensive scraping.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan.

				"longDescription": "DataDome is the #1 SaaS bot protection solution for e-commerce and classifieds businesses. DataDome offers real-time AI protection against all OWASP automated threats, including credential stuffing, layer 7 DDoS attacks, SQL injection & intensive scraping.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan. Pricing plans are available on our [website](https://datadome.co/pricing?utm_source=cloudflare_app).",

DataDome offers real-time AI protection against all OWASP automated threats, including credential stuffing, layer 7 DDoS attacks, SQL injection & intensive scraping.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan.

				"longDescription": "DataDome is the #1 SaaS bot protection solution for e-commerce and classifieds businesses. DataDome offers real-time AI protection against all OWASP automated threats, including credential stuffing, layer 7 DDoS attacks, SQL injection & intensive scraping.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website.

				"longDescription": "DataDome is the #1 SaaS bot protection solution for e-commerce and classifieds businesses. DataDome offers real-time AI protection against all OWASP automated threats, including credential stuffing, layer 7 DDoS attacks, SQL injection & intensive scraping.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan. Pricing plans are available on our [website](https://datadome.co/pricing?utm_source=cloudflare_app).",

It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan. Pricing plans are available on our [website](https://datadome.co/pricing?utm_source=cloudflare_app).",

				"longDescription": "DataDome is the #1 SaaS bot protection solution for e-commerce and classifieds businesses. DataDome offers real-time AI protection against all OWASP automated threats, including credential stuffing, layer 7 DDoS attacks, SQL injection & intensive scraping.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan. Pricing plans are available on our [website](https://datadome.co/pricing?utm_source=cloudflare_app).",

				"longDescription": "DataDome is the #1 SaaS bot protection solution for e-commerce and classifieds businesses. DataDome offers real-time AI protection against all OWASP automated threats, including credential stuffing, layer 7 DDoS attacks, SQL injection & intensive scraping.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan. Pricing plans are available on our [website](https://datadome.co/pricing?utm_source=cloudflare_app).",

DataDome offers real-time AI protection against all OWASP automated threats, including credential stuffing, layer 7 DDoS attacks, SQL injection & intensive scraping.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan. Pricing plans are available on our [website](https://datadome.co/pricing?utm_source=cloudflare_app).",

				"shortDescription": "Bot Detection for Mobile Apps, Websites, & APIs",
				"longDescription": "DataDome’s bot and online fraud protection detects and mitigates attacks with unparalleled accuracy and zero compromise. Our machine learning solution analyzes 3 trillion signals per day to adapt to new threats in real time. Our 24/7 SOC experts protect hundreds of high-profile brands worldwide, including Reddit, Patreon, and AngelList. A force multiplier for IT and security teams, DataDome is fully transparent, easy to deploy, and frictionless for consumers. In 2022, DataDome was named a Strong Performer in the Forrester Wave: Bot Management and ranked the top G2 Leader in Bot Detection & Mitigation for Fall 2022.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan. Pricing plans are available on our [website](https://datadome.co/pricing?utm_source=cloudflare_app).",

				"longDescription": "DataDome’s bot and online fraud protection detects and mitigates attacks with unparalleled accuracy and zero compromise. Our machine learning solution analyzes 3 trillion signals per day to adapt to new threats in real time. Our 24/7 SOC experts protect hundreds of high-profile brands worldwide, including Reddit, Patreon, and AngelList. A force multiplier for IT and security teams, DataDome is fully transparent, easy to deploy, and frictionless for consumers. In 2022, DataDome was named a Strong Performer in the Forrester Wave: Bot Management and ranked the top G2 Leader in Bot Detection & Mitigation for Fall 2022.\n\n#Deploy in seconds\nDataDome is the only bot protection solution delivered as-a-service. It requires no architecture changes or DNS rerouting, and will never be a single point of failure. Deploying the solution is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds. \n\nThe DataDome app for Cloudflare enables Real-Time Bot Protection on Cloudflare websites.\n\n#Real-time AI bot detection\nOur bot detection engine compares every hit to your website with a massive in-memory pattern database, and uses a blend of AI and machine learning to decide in less than 2 milliseconds whether access to your pages should be granted or not.\n\nOur algorithm analyzes hundreds of billions of daily events, and updates continuously in order to identify both familiar and zero-day threats.\n\n#Best-in-class bot protection\nDataDome detects and identifies 100% of OWASP automated threats, and classifies them in your dashboard for easy monitoring and analysis: Denial of Service, Web scraping, Checkout abuse, Inventory hoarding, Card fraud, Credential stuffing, Business logic, Vulnerability scanning, ...\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/notifications-screens-zoom3.jpg\">\n\n#Instant shared intelligence\nThere’s strength in numbers – and in cutting-edge stacks. When a new undesirable bot is detected on one of the more than 10,000 domains protected by DataDome, all our customers are automatically protected in less than 50 milliseconds.\n\nWe’ll send you real-time notifications via email or Slack whenever your site is under attack, but you don’t have to do anything. DataDome will deal with the bots, so your on-call teams can focus on other issues.\n\n#Bot management on autopilot\nDataDome requires no daily interventions from your teams. Once you have set up your whitelist of trusted partner bots, the solution will take care of all your unwanted traffic.\n\nOf course, your mobile apps and APIs are just as safe as your website. Because every interface has different legitimate usage patterns, DataDome protects each of them with a dedicated algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-bad-bots-1.gif\">\n\n#Unmatched customization options\nOur unique Custom Rules function allows you, for example, to block human traffic from countries you are not selling to, or to allow partner bots to access your site only in specific circumstances.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-custom-rules.gif\">\n\n#Powerful analytics tools\nNo other bot protection solution provides you with more detailed insights into the automated traffic that targets your site. Once activated, DataDome enriches every hit to your site with ID tags in real time.\n\n<img src=\"https://datadome.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dashboard-analytics-800x444.png\">\n\n#References\nWe are proud to count first class ecommerce and classifieds businesses from all over the world amongst our references: ClassMates, Rakuten, UBM (Black Hat), Kurt Geiger, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Schibsted.\n\n#Trial & Pricing\nYou can try DataDome free for 30 days. During the free trial, you will be able to analyze your traffic and see the attacks you are facing. In order to activate the protection, you will have to upgrade to a subscription plan. Pricing plans are available on our [website](https://datadome.co/pricing?utm_source=cloudflare_app).",
