	<p>Under-resourced organizations that are vital to the basic functioning of our global communities face relentless cyber attacks, threatening basic needs for health, safety and security.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare’s mission is to help make a better Internet. Starting December 13, 2022, we will help support these vulnerable infrastructure by providing our enterprise-level <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> cybersecurity solution to them at no cost, with no time limit.</p>
	<p>It is our pleasure to introduce our newest <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/impact">Impact</a> initiative: Project Safekeeping.</p>

	<p>Critical infrastructure is an obvious target for cyber attack: by its very definition, these are the organizations and systems that are crucial for the functioning of our society and economy. As such, these organizations cannot have prolonged interruptions in service, or risk having sensitive data exposed.</p>
	<p>Our conversations over the past few months with government officials in Australia, Germany, Japan, Portugal, and the United Kingdom show that they are focused on the threat to critical infrastructure, but resource constraints mean that their attention is on protecting large organizations – immense financial institutions, hospital networks, oil pipelines, and airports. Yet, the small critical infrastructure organizations that are the foundation of our communities are also at risk: the neighborhood hospital, water treatment facility, and local energy provider that fulfill our fundamental needs. We tend to ignore the small-yet-vitally-important companies that form the supply chains of our nationwide critical systems.</p>
	<p>Unlike large organizations, smaller organizations typically do not have the capacity to manage relentless cyber attacks – usually operating on shoestring budgets, they do not have security personnel, threat insight teams, or the latest technology to keep their organizations secure. The numerous real life examples of cyber attacks against these small but vital organizations best illustrate the devastating impacts: in Japan, ransomware shut down a hospital’s access to patient records for nearly two months, halting the hospital’s ability to accept any new patients, including emergency patients; and in Germany, ransomware compromised a local county’s IT systems and no local public services could be provided to citizens for weeks, while the county is still struggling with the aftermath of the attack one year on.</p>

	<p>We at Cloudflare believe in helping to build a better Internet, for <i>everyone</i>. And we think that the welfare of our local communities should not be at risk because of the budget and operational constraints of these small and vulnerable entities. We think that we are particularly well-suited to help: Cloudflare is a global cybersecurity provider that blocked an average of 126 billion cyber threats <i>each day</i> in Q3 2022. And with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo">Project Galileo</a> and the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian">Athenian Project</a>, we have rich experience supporting organizations that are particularly vulnerable to cyber threats and lack the resources to protect themselves.</p>
	<p>We want our support to be meaningful in order to allow these entities to focus on what they do best – meeting our communities’ basic needs. As expressed in this <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/zero-trust-not-a-buzzword">blog</a>, Cloudflare provides an innovative and elegant solution to cybersecurity: Zero Trust. Zero Trust is a radical change in the approach to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-cyber-security">cybersecurity</a> that is both effective and effortless, something that a resource-strapped organization will certainly appreciate.</p>
	<p>Earlier this year, in response to the increasing cyber attacks on critical infrastructure stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we provided our Zero Trust solution to critical infrastructure in the United States via the <a href="https://criticalinfrastructuredefense.org">Critical Infrastructure Defense Project</a>. Now, we are expanding our support to the global community, initially focusing our efforts in Australia, Japan, Germany, Portugal and the United Kingdom.</p>
