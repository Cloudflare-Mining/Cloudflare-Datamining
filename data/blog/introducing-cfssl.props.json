CFSSL is used internally by CloudFlare for bundling TLS/SSL certificates chains, and for our internal Certificate Authority infrastructure. We use this tool for all our TLS certificates.</p><p>Creating a certificate bundle is a common pain point for website operators, and doing it right is important for <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/how-to-secure-a-website/\">website security</a> AND speed (CloudFlare does both). Getting the correct bundle together is a black art, and can quickly become a debugging nightmare if it&#39;s not done correctly. We wrote CFSSL to make bundling easier. By picking the right chain of certificates, CFSSL solves the balancing act between performance, security, and compatibility.</p><p>Staying true to our <a href=\"/what-we-just-did-to-make-ssl-even-faster\">promise</a> to make the web fast and safe, we’re open sourcing CFSSL. We believe CFSSL will be useful for anyone building a site using HTTPS—from website owners to large software-as-a-service companies. CFSSL is written in Go and available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl\">CloudFlare Github account</a>. It can be used as a web service with a JSON API, and as a handy command line tool.</p><p>CFSSL is the result of real-world expertise about how the TLS ecosystem on the Web works that you can gain by working at CloudFlare’s scale. These are hard-won lessons, applied in code. The rest of this blog post serves as an under-the-hood look at how and why CFSSL works, and how you can use it as a certificate bundler or as a lightweight CA.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/8WQQFZJ2zXV0Z0syJB0W4/b8552d223bc0632d986a4f5f7630c3cf/image02_2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"450\" height=\"452\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As you can see in the above image, the key is owned by CloudFlare, Inc., and the issuer is GlobalSign (a well-known CA). GlobalSign has issued a certificate named “GlobalSign Extended Validation CA - SHA256 - G2”; this G2 certificate is signed by another certificate called “GlobalSign Root CA - R2”. Note that the root certificate does not have an issuer—it is signed by its own private key. In other words, the root vouches for itself.</p><p>The reason your browser trusts a root certificate is because browsers have a list of root certificates that they implicitly trust, and when a site is trusted it will show the lock icon to the left of the web address (see image below). Certain certificates are on the list typically because they have been around for some time, and they belong to certificate authorities that have gone through a rigorous security audit. GlobalSign is one of these trusted authorities; therefore, its root certificate is in the list of trusted root certificates for nearly every browser.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"what-are-ssl-certificates\">What Are SSL Certificates?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#what-are-ssl-certificates\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>SSL certificates form the core of trust on the web by assuring the identity of websites. This trust is built by digitally binding a cryptographic key to an organization’s identity. An SSL certificate will bind domain names to server names, and company names to locations. This ensures that if you go to your bank’s web site, for example, you know for sure it is your bank, and you are not giving out your information to a phishing scam.</p><p>A certificate is a file that contains a public key which is bound to a record of its owner. The mechanism that makes this binding trustworthy is called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure\">Public Key Infrastructure</a> and public-key cryptography is the glue that makes this possible.</p><p>A certificate is associated with a private key that corresponds to the certificate&#39;s public key, which is stored separately. The certificate comes with a digital signature from a trusted third-party called a certificate authority or CA. Let&#39;s examine the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\">cloudflare.com</a> certificate.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1u6Z00nvpHwI1E8dSWPeey/7e2c6d3406cda89d35c8a487122c5399/image00_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"426\" height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The length of intermediate certificates in a chain can vary, but chains will always have one leaf and one root.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/NRD5jcwOz6WLiDesX2QS6/4a2ade24a1ed76028ceabfc3d7e9940a/image01_4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"960\" height=\"815\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Unfortunately, there is a catch for the owner of the leaf certificate: presenting only the leaf certificate to the browser is usually not enough. The intermediate certificates are not always known to the browser, requiring the website to include them with the leaf certificate. The list of certificates that the browser needs to validate a certificate is called a certificate bundle. It should contain all the certificates in the chain up to the first certificate known to the browser. In the case of the CloudFlare website, this bundle contains both the cloudflare.com certificate and the GlobalSign G2 intermediate.</p><p>CFSSL was written to make certificate bundling easier.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-cfssl-makes-certificate-bundling-easier\">How CFSSL Makes Certificate Bundling Easier</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-cfssl-makes-certificate-bundling-easier\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>If you are running a website (or perhaps some other TLS-based service) and need to install a certificate, CFSSL can create the certificate bundle for you. Start with the following command:</p><p>$ cfssl bundle -cert mycert.crt</p><p>This will output a JSON blob containing the chain of certificates along with relevant information extracted from that chain. Alternatively, you can run the CFSSL service that responds to requests with a JSON API:</p><p>$ cfssl serve</p><p>This command opens up an HTTP service on localhost that accepts requests. To bundle using this API, send a POST request to this service, <code>[http://localhost:8888/api/v1/cfssl/bundle](http://localhost:8888/api/v1/cfssl/bundle)</code>, using a JSON request such as:</p><p>{\n&quot;certificate&quot;: \n}</p><p>CloudFlare’s SSL service will return a JSON response of the form:</p><p>{\n&quot;result&quot;: {},\n&quot;success&quot;: true,\n&quot;errors&quot;: [],\n&quot;messages&quot;: [],\n}</p><p><i>(Developers take note: this response format is a preview of our upcoming CloudFlare API rewrite; with this API, we can use CFSSL as a service for certificate bundling and more—stay tuned.)</i></p><p>If you upload your certificate to CloudFlare, this is what is used to create a certificate bundle for your website.</p><p>To create a certificate bundle with CFSSL, you need to know which certificates are trusted by the browsers you hope to display content to. In a controlled corporate environment, this is usually easy since every browser is set up with the same configuration; however, it becomes more difficult when creating a bundle for the web.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"different-certs-for-different-folks\">Different Certs for Different Folks</h3>\n      <a href=\"#different-certs-for-different-folks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Each browser has unique capabilities and configurations, and a certificate bundle that’s trusted in one browser might not be trusted in another; this can happen for several reasons:</p><ol><li><p><i>Different browsers trust different root certificates.</i>Some browsers trust more root certificates than others. For example, the NSS root store used in Firefox trusts 143 certificates; however, Windows 8.1 trusts 391 certificates. So a bundle with a chain that expects the browser to trust a certificate exclusive to the Windows root store will appear as untrusted in Firefox.</p></li><li><p><i>Older systems might have old root stores.</i>Some browsers run on older systems that have not been updated to trust recently-created certificate authorities. For example, Android 2.2 and earlier don&#39;t trust the “GoDaddy Root Certificate Authority G2” because that root certificate was created after they were released.</p></li><li><p><i>Older systems don&#39;t support modern cryptography.</i>Users on Windows XP SP2 and earlier can&#39;t validate certificates signed by certain intermediates. This includes the “DigiCert SHA2 High Assurance Server CA” because the hash function SHA-2 used in this certificate was standardised after Windows XP was released.</p></li></ol><p>In order to provide maximum compatibility between SSL chains and browsers, you often have to pick a different certificate chain than the one originally provided to you by your CA. This alternate chain might contain a different set of intermediates that are signed by a different root certificate. Alternate chains can be troublesome. They tend to contain a longer list of certificates than the default chain from the CA, and longer chains cause site connections to be slower. This lag is because the web server needs to send more certificates (i.e. more data) to the browser, and the browser has to spend time verifying more certificates on its end. Picking the right chain can be tricky.</p><p>CFSSL helps pick the right certificate chain, selecting for performance, security, and compatibility.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-to-pick-the-best-chain\">How to Pick the Best Chain</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-to-pick-the-best-chain\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The chain of trust works by following the keys used to sign certificates, and there can be multiple chains of trust for the same keys.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4Sn8stqKCF4WIYBx0FQYXX/3f8fa1869553c4430e1506b3fbef5bda/image03_4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"960\" height=\"815\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In this diagram, all of the intermediates have the same public key and represent the same identity (GlobalSign&#39;s intermediate signing certificate), and they are signed by the GlobalSign root key; however, the issuance date for each chain and signature type are different.</p><p>For some outdated browsers, the current GlobalSign root certificate is not trusted, so GlobalSign used an older CA (GlobalSign nv-sa) to sign their root certificate.

CFSSL should be used behind a middle layer that processes incoming requests, and ensures they conform to policy; we use it behind the CloudFlare site as an internal service.</p><p>Here’s an example of signing a certificate with CFSSL on the command line:</p><p>$ cfssl sign -ca-key=test-key.pem -ca=test-cert.pem <a href=\"http://www.example.com\">www.example.com</a> example.csr</p><p>Alternatively, a POST request containing the CSR and hostname can be sent to the CFSSL service via the <code>/api/v1/cfssl/sign</code> endpoint. To run the service call the <code>serve</code> command as follows:</p><p>$ cfssl serve -address=localhost -port=8888 -ca-key=test-key.pem -ca=test-cert.pem</p><p>If you already have a CFSSL instance running (in this case on localhost, but it can be anywhere), you can automate certificate creation with the gencert command’s <code>-remote</code> option. For example, if CFSSL is running on localhost, running the following gives you a private key and a certificate signed by the CA:</p><p>$ cfssl gencert -remote=&quot;localhost:8888&quot; <a href=\"http://www.example.com\">www.example.com</a> csr.json</p><p>At CloudFlare we use CFSSL heavily for <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/railgun\">Railgun</a> and other internal services.

Encrypted sites create a safer, more private internet for everyone; by open-sourcing CFSSL, we’re making this process easier.</p><p>We have big plans for the CA part of this tool. Currently, we run CFSSL on secure locked-down machines, but plan to add stronger hardware security. Adding stronger hardware security involves integrating CFSSL with low-cost Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). This ensures that private keys stay private, even in the event of a breach.</p><p>For additional information on CFSSL and our other open source projects, check out our <a href=\"https://cloudflare.github.io\">Github page</a>. We encourage users to file issues on Github as they find bugs.</p>",
