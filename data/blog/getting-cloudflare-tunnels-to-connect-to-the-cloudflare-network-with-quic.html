	<p>I work on <i>Cloudflare Tunnel</i>, which lets customers quickly connect their private services and networks through the Cloudflare network without having to expose their public IPs or ports through their firewall. Tunnel is managed for users by <i>cloudflared</i>, a tool that runs on the same network as the private services. It proxies traffic for these services via Cloudflare, and users can then access these services securely through the Cloudflare network.</p>
	<p>Recently, I was trying to get <i>Cloudflare Tunnel</i> to connect to the Cloudflare network using a UDP protocol, QUIC. While doing this, I ran into an interesting connectivity problem unique to UDP. In this post I will talk about how I went about debugging this connectivity issue beyond the land of firewalls, and how some interesting differences between UDP and TCP came into play when sending network packets.</p>

	<p><i>cloudflared</i> works by opening several connections to different servers on the Cloudflare edge. Currently, these are long-lived TCP-based connections proxied over HTTP/2 frames. When Cloudflare receives a request to a hostname, it is proxied through these connections to the local service behind <i>cloudflared</i>.</p>
	<p>While our HTTP/2 protocol mode works great, we’d like to improve a few things. First, TCP traffic sent over HTTP/2 is susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking">Head of Line (HoL) blocking</a> — this affects both HTTP traffic and traffic from <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/warp-to-tunnel">WARP routing</a>. Additionally, it is currently not possible to initiate communication from <i>cloudflared’s</i> HTTP/2 server in an efficient way. With the current Go implementation of HTTP/2, we could use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events#:~:text=Server%2DSent%20Events%20(SSE),client%20connection%20has%20been%20established.">Server-Sent Events</a>, but this is not very useful in the scheme of proxying L4 traffic.</p>
	<p>The upgrade to QUIC solves possible HoL blocking issues and opens up avenues that allow us to initiate communication from <i>cloudflared</i> to a different <i>cloudflared</i> in the future.</p>
	<p>Naturally, QUIC required a UDP-based listener on our edge servers which <i>cloudflared</i> could connect to. We already connect to a TCP-based listener for the existing protocols, so this should be nice and easy, right?</p>

	<p>Things weren’t as straightforward as they first looked. I added a QUIC listener on the edge, and the ability for <i>cloudflared</i> to connect to this new UDP-based listener. I tried to run my brand new QUIC tunnel and this happened.</p>

	<p><i>cloudflared</i> wasn’t even establishing a connection to the edge. I started looking at the obvious places first. <i>Did I add a firewall rule allowing traffic to this port?</i> Check_.

	<p>I started by logging for UDP traffic on the machine my server was running on to see what could be happening.</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$  sudo tcpdump -n -i eth0 port 7844 and udp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
14:44:27.742629 IP 173.13.13.10.50152 &gt; 198.41.200.200.7844: UDP, length 1252
14:44:27.743298 IP 203.0.113.0.7844 &gt; 173.13.13.10.50152: UDP, length 37</code></pre>
	<p>Looking at this <i>tcpdump</i> helped me understand why I had no connectivity! Not only was this port getting UDP traffic but I was also seeing traffic flow out. But there seemed to be something strange afoot. Incoming packets were being sent to 198.41.200.200:7844 while responses were being sent back from 203.0.113.0:7844 (this is an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5737">example IP</a> used for illustration purposes) &nbsp;instead.</p>
	<p>Why is this a problem? If a host (in this case, the server) chooses an address from a network unable to communicate with a public Internet host, it is likely that the return half of the communication will never arrive. But wait a minute. Why is some other IP getting prioritized over a source address my packets were already being sent to? Let’s take a deeper look at some IP addresses. (Note that I’ve deliberately oversimplified and scrambled results to minimally illustrate the problem)</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$  ip addr list
eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1600 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
inet 203.0.113.0/32 scope global eth0
inet 198.41.200.200/32 scope global eth0 </code></pre>

	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ ip route show
default via 203.0.113.0 dev eth0</code></pre>
	<p>So this was clearly why the server was working fine on my machine but not on the Cloudflare edge servers. It looks like I have multiple IPs on the interface my service is bound to. The IP that is the default route is being sent back as the source address of the packet.</p>

	<p>Connection-oriented protocols, like TCP, initiate a connection (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html">connect()</a>) with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking#TCP_three-way_handshake">three-way handshake</a>. The kernel therefore maintains a state about ongoing connections and uses this to determine the source IP address at the time of a response.</p>
	<p>Because UDP (unless SOCK_SEQPACKET is involved) is connectionless, the kernel cannot maintain state like TCP does. The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/recvfrom.3p.html"><i>recvfrom</i></a> &nbsp;system call is invoked from the server side and tells who the data comes from. Unfortunately, <i>recvfrom</i> &nbsp;does not tell us which IP this data is addressed for. Therefore, when the UDP server invokes the <code>[sendto](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sendto.3p.html) system call</code> to respond to the client, we can only tell it which address to send the data to. The responsibility of determining the source-address IP then falls to the kernel. The kernel has certain <a href="http://linux-ip.net/html/routing-selection.html">heuristics</a> that it uses to determine the source address. This may or may not work, and in the <i>ip routes</i> example above, these heuristics did not work. The kernel naturally (and wrongly) picks the address of the default route to respond with.</p>

	<p>I had to rely on my application to set the source address explicitly and therefore not rely on kernel heuristics.</p>
	<p>Linux has some generic I/O system calls, namely <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/recvmsg.3p.html"><i>recvmsg</i></a> &nbsp;and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sendmsg.3p.html"><i>sendmsg</i></a>. Their function signatures allow us to both read or write additional <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Out_002dof_002dBand-Data.html">out-of-band data</a> we can pass the source address to. This control information is passed via the <i>msghdr</i> struct’s <i>msg_control</i> field.</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">ssize_t sendmsg(int socket, const struct msghdr *message, int flags)
ssize_t recvmsg(int socket, struct msghdr *message, int flags);
 
struct msghdr {
     void    *   msg_name;   /* Socket name          */
     int     msg_namelen;    /* Length of name       */
     struct iovec *  msg_iov;    /* Data blocks          */
     __kernel_size_t msg_iovlen; /* Number of blocks     */
     void    *   msg_control;    /* Per protocol magic (eg BSD file descriptor passing) */
    __kernel_size_t msg_controllen; /* Length of cmsg list */
     unsigned int    msg_flags;
};</code></pre>
	<p>We can now copy the control information we’ve gotten from <i>recvmsg</i> back when calling <i>sendmsg</i>, providing the kernel with information about the source address.The library I used (<a href="https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go">https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go</a>) had a recent update that did exactly this! I pulled the changes into my service and gave it a spin.</p>
	<p>But alas. It did not work! A quick <i>tcpdump</i> showed that the same source address was being sent back. It seemed clear from reading the source code that the <i>recvmsg</i> and <i>sendmsg</i> were being called with the right values. It did not make sense.</p>
	<p>So I had to see for myself if these system calls were being made.</p>

	<p>Let's start with <i>recvmsg</i> . We can clearly see that the ipi_addr for the source is being passed correctly: <i>ipi_addr=inet_addr("172.16.90.131")</i>. This part works as expected.

	<p>While the programmatic bug causing this issue was a trivial one, the journey into systematically discovering the issue and understanding how Linux internals worked for UDP along the way turned out to be very rewarding for me. It also reiterated my belief that <i>tcpdump</i> and <i>strace</i> are indeed invaluable tools in anybody’s arsenal when debugging network problems.</p>
