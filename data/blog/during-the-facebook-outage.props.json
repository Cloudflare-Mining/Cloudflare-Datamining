We do, however, ask ourselves the more important questions: &quot;How did this affect us?&quot; and &quot;What if this had happened to us?&quot; Asking and answering these questions whenever something like this happens is a great and healthy exercise that helps us improve our own resilience.</p><p>Today, we&#39;re going to show you how the Facebook and affiliate sites downtime affected us, and what we can see in our data.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"1-1-1-1\">1.1.1.1</h3>\n            <a href=\"#1-1-1-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>1.1.1.1 is a fast and privacy-centric public DNS resolver operated by Cloudflare, used by millions of users, browsers, and devices worldwide. Let&#39;s look at our telemetry and see what we find.</p><p>First, the obvious. If we look at the response rate, there was a massive spike in the number of SERVFAIL codes. SERVFAILs can happen for several reasons; we have an excellent blog called <a href=\"/unwrap-the-servfail/\">Unwrap the SERVFAIL</a> that you should read if you&#39;re curious.</p><p>In this case, we started serving SERVFAIL responses to all facebook.com and whatsapp.com DNS queries because our resolver couldn&#39;t access the upstream Facebook authoritative servers. About 60x times more than the average on a typical day.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7BKM7m3fUz3fCRrVuCN3jh/2a4ef51aef813a86403ff85eae286927/image16.png\" alt=\"Mean query rate by response code\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"823\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>If we look at all the queries, not specific to Facebook or WhatsApp domains, and we split them by IPv4 and IPv6 clients, we can see that our load increased too.</p><p>As explained before, this is due to a snowball effect associated with applications and users retrying after the errors and generating even more traffic. In this case, 1.1.1.1 had to handle more than the expected rate for A and AAAA queries.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7a67lujBcgIkqVusTr4R1t/52b1aab0a31505e8839de38995e977e8/image3-12.png\" alt=\"Resolver: Mean query rate by queryType, A and AAAA only\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"823\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Here&#39;s another fun one.</p><p>DNS vs. DoT and DoH. Typically, DNS queries and responses are <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-4.2\">sent in plaintext over UDP</a> (or TCP sometimes), and that&#39;s been the case for decades now. Naturally, this poses security and privacy risks to end-users as it allows in-transit attacks or traffic snooping.</p><p>With DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS, clients can talk DNS using well-known, well-supported encryption and authentication protocols.</p><p>Our learning center has a good article on &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-over-tls/\">DNS over TLS vs. DNS over HTTPS</a>&quot; that you can read. Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge have supported DoH for some time now, WAP uses DoH too, and you can even configure your operating system to use the new protocols.</p><p>When Facebook went offline, we saw the number of DoT+DoH SERVFAILs responses grow by over x300 vs. the average rate.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/TNHkfPvSSHUxljyh89S5a/0211b2766f0f62dc392373eda96cafe8/image14.png\" alt=\"DNS vs Do* (SERVFAIL only)\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"823\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2pdogcCvQMRd10yEPUV0hu/b0fa09f5ad587ca3936c56ed1ea2b6b6/image11-1.png\" alt=\"DoH vs DNS (SERVAIL only)\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"823\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6GJdW0PO7zIHBlnkKTyGa2/bc9105af10eda4d875bc94cf6fdc78f2/image4-13.png\" alt=\"DoH vs DNS vs DoT (SERVFAIL only)\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"823\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>So, we got hammered with lots of requests and errors, causing traffic spikes to our 1.1.1.1 resolver and causing an unexpected load in the edge network and systems. How did we perform during this stressful period?</p><p>Quite well. 1.1.1.1 kept its cool and continued serving the vast majority of requests around the <a href=\"https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers\">famous 10ms mark</a>. An insignificant fraction of p95 and p99 percentiles saw increased response times, probably due to timeouts trying to reach Facebook’s nameservers.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/ZzJKGMnii2ghnbRxI8UoT/81ee75225259ea182b4702f80a7e4832/image6-11.png\" alt=\"Response time quantiles\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"823\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Another interesting perspective is the distribution of the ratio between SERVFAIL and good DNS answers, by country.

We log in, and we access Facebook, we post. It turns out that Facebook likes to visit us too, quite a lot. Like Google and other platforms, Facebook uses an army of crawlers to constantly check websites for data and updates. Those robots gather information about websites content, such as its titles, descriptions, thumbnail images, and metadata. You can learn more about this on the &quot;<a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/crawler/\">The Facebook Crawler</a>&quot; page and the <a href=\"https://ogp.me/\">Open Graph</a> website.</p><p>Here&#39;s what we see when traffic is coming from the Facebook ASN, supposedly from crawlers, to our CDN sites:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5bWgF42TihmULktktsg6TX/e345515ef51896da07287059b416da3d/image10-3.png\" alt=\"Traffic from facebook ASN 32934\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"823\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The robots went silent.</p><p>What about the traffic coming to our CDN sites from Facebook <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent\">User-Agents</a>?

Browsers, apps, and other clients deliberately change the User-Agent string when they fetch pages from the Internet to hide, obtain access to certain features, or bypass paywalls (because pay-walled sites want sites like Facebook to index their content, so that then they get more traffic from links).</p><p>Fortunately, there are newer, and privacy-centric standards emerging like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User-Agent_Client_Hints_API\">User-Agent Client Hints</a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"core-web-vitals\">Core Web Vitals</h3>\n            <a href=\"#core-web-vitals\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Core Web Vitals are the subset of <a href=\"https://web.dev/vitals/\">Web Vitals</a>, an initiative by Google to provide a unified interface to measure real-world quality signals when a user visits a web page.
