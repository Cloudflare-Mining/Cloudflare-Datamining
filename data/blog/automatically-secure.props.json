The protocol allows two strangers (like a client and server) to communicate securely.</p><p>Every secure web session begins with a TLS handshake. Before a single byte of your data moves across the Internet, servers and clients need to agree on a shared secret key that will protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data. The key agreement handshake kicks off with a TLS <i>ClientHello</i> message. This message is the browser/client announcing, “Here’s who I want to talk to (via <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/\"><u>SNI</u></a>), and here are the key agreement methods I understand.” The server then proves who it is with its own credentials in the form of a certificate, and together they establish a shared secret key that will protect everything that follows. </p><p>TLS 1.3 added a clever shortcut: instead of waiting to be told which method to use for the shared key agreement, the browser can guess what key agreement the server supports, and include one or more <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3/\"><u>keyshares</u></a> right away. If the guess is correct, the handshake skips an extra round trip and the secure connection is established more quickly. If the guess is wrong, the server responds with a <i>HelloRetryRequest</i> (HRR), telling the browser which key agreement method to retry with. This speculative guessing is a major reason TLS 1.3 is so much faster than TLS 1.2.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/W2t0sZjiliwZ0FGfFFG6k/113c44b54da1c0355d5bf76fba3080fa/1-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1150\" height=\"897\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Once both sides agree, the chosen keyshare is used to create a shared secret that encrypts the messages they exchange and allows only the right parties to decrypt them.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-nitty-gritty-details-of-key-agreement\">The nitty-gritty details of key agreement</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-nitty-gritty-details-of-key-agreement\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Up until recently, most of these handshakes have relied on <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/\"><u>elliptic curve cryptography</u></a> (ECC) using a curve known as X25519.

While we had initially spent an incredibly long time developing secure connections for the “front door” (from browsers to Cloudflare’s edge) with <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/\"><u>Universal SSL</u></a>, we knew that the “back door” (from Cloudflare’s edge to origin servers) would be slower and harder to upgrade. </p><p>One option we offered was <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/\"><u>Cloudflare Tunnel</u></a>, where a lightweight agent runs near the origin server and tunnels traffic securely back to Cloudflare. This approach ensures the connection always uses modern encryption, without requiring changes on the origin itself.</p><p>But not every customer uses Tunnel. Many connect origins directly to Cloudflare’s edge, where encryption depends on the origin server’s configuration. Traditionally this meant customers had to either manually select an <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/\"><u>encryption mode</u></a> that worked for their origin server or rely on the default chosen by Cloudflare. </p><p>To improve the experience of choosing an encryption mode, we introduced our <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/ssl-tls-recommender/\"><u>SSL/TLS Recommender</u></a> in 2021.</p><p>The Recommender scanned customer origin servers and then provided recommendations for their most secure encryption mode. For example, if the Recommender detected that an origin server was using a certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) such as Let’s Encrypt, rather than a self-signed certificate, it would recommend upgrading from <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/\"><b><u>Full</u></b><u> encryption mode</u></a> to <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/\"><b><u>Full (Strict)</u></b><u> encryption mode</u></a>.</p><p>Based on how the origin responded, Recommender would tell customers if they could improve their SSL/TLS encryption mode to be more secure. The following encryption modes represent what the SSL/TLS Recommender could recommend to customers based on their origin responses: </p><table><tr><td><p><b>SSL/TLS mode</b></p></td><td><p><b>HTTP from visitor</b></p></td><td><p><b>HTTPS from visitor</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/off/\"><u>Off</u></a></p></td><td><p>HTTP to Origin</p></td><td><p>HTTP to Origin</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/flexible/\"><u>Flexible</u></a></p></td><td><p>HTTP to Origin</p></td><td><p>HTTP to Origin</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/\"><u>Full</u></a></p></td><td><p>HTTP to Origin</p></td><td><p>HTTPS to Origin without certification validation check</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/\"><u>Full (strict)</u></a></p></td><td><p>HTTP to Origin</p></td><td><p>HTTPS to Origin with certificate validation check</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/ssl-only-origin-pull/\"><u>Strict (SSL-only origin pull)</u></a></p></td><td><p>HTTPS to Origin with certificate validation check</p></td><td><p>HTTPS to Origin with certificate validation check</p></td></tr></table><p>However, in the three years after launching our Recommender we discovered something troubling: of the over two million domains using Recommender, <b>only 30% of the recommendations that the system provided were followed</b>. A significant number of users would not complete the next step of pushing the button to inform Cloudflare that we could communicate with their origin over a more secure setting. </p><p>We were seeing sub-optimal settings that our customers could upgrade from without risk of breaking their site, but for various reasons, our users did not follow through with the recommendations.

Looking at the ratios across all origin requests, the trends are clear:</p><ul><li><p><b>Encryption is rising.</b> Plaintext connections are steadily declining, a reflection of Automatic SSL/TLS helping millions of domains move to HTTPS by default. We’ve seen <b>a correlated 7-8% reduction in plaintext origin-bound connections.</b> Still, some origins remain on outdated configurations, and these should be upgraded to keep pace with modern security expectations.</p></li><li><p><b>TLS 1.3 is surging.</b> Since late 2024, TLS 1.3 adoption has climbed sharply, now making up the majority of encrypted origin traffic (almost 60%). While Automatic SSL/TLS doesn’t control which TLS version an origin supports, this shift is an encouraging sign for both performance and security.</p></li><li><p><b>Older versions are fading.</b> Month after month, TLS 1.2 continues to shrink, while TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are now so rare they barely register.</p></li></ul><p>The decline in plaintext connections is encouraging, but it also highlights a long tail of servers still relying on outdated packages or configurations. Sites like <a href=\"https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/\"><u>SSL Labs</u></a> can be used, for instance, to check a server’s TLS configuration.

After that milestone, traffic patterns leveled off into a steady plateau, reflecting a more stable baseline of secure connections across the network. There is some drop in encrypted traffic which may represent some of the originally upgraded domains manually turning off Automatic SSL/TLS.</p><p>But the story doesn’t end there. In the past two months (July and August 2025), we’ve observed another noticeable uptick in encrypted origin traffic. This likely reflects customers upgrading outdated origin packages and enabling stronger TLS support—evidence that Automatic SSL/TLS not only raised the floor on encryption but continues nudging the long tail of domains toward better security.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6nJe12swMSMXBQsgzEhXtq/78debf8e0c3efbaf66bce8cf6e623c80/4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1962\" height=\"944\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>To further explore the “encrypted” line above, we wanted to see what the delta was between TLS 1.2 and 1.3.

We see a noticeable rise in the support for both TLS 1.2 and 1.3 between Cloudflare and origin servers. What is also interesting to note here is the network-wide decrease in TLS 1.2 but for the domains that have been automatically upgraded a generalized increase, potentially also signifying origin TLS stacks that could be updated further.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/BoRlq4irKWuvuXs5E4e8l/3971165f5029a03ae64dac79235a8671/5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"843\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Finally, for Full (Strict) mode,<b> </b>we wanted to investigate the number of successful certificate validations we performed.

To counter this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later\"><u>harvest-now, decrypt-later</u></a> threat, the industry is moving towards post-quantum cryptography (PQC)—algorithms designed to withstand quantum attacks. We have extensively written on this subject <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/post-quantum/\"><u>in our previous blogs</u></a>.</p><p>In August 2024, NIST finalized its PQC standards: <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.203.pdf\"><u>ML-KEM</u></a> for key agreement, and <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.204.pdf\"><u>ML-DSA</u></a> and <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.205.pdf\"><u>SLH-DSA</u></a> for digital signatures. In collaboration with industry partners, Cloudflare has helped drive the development and deployment of PQC. We have deployed the hybrid key agreement, combining ML-KEM (post-quantum secure) and X25519 (classical), to secure TLS 1.3 traffic to our servers and internal systems. As of mid-September 2025, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption-adoption\"><u>around 43%</u></a> of human-generated connections to Cloudflare are already protected with the hybrid post-quantum secure key agreement – a huge milestone in preparing the Internet for the quantum era.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2hgIUNO8TM50kvAOvzQ8rg/cdbe5b3d64390fc4b946036e2f37471d/6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"843\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>But things look different on the other side of the network. When Cloudflare connects to origins, we act as the client, navigating a fragmented landscape of hosting providers, software stacks, and middleboxes. Each origin may support a different set of cryptographic features, and not all are ready for hybrid post-quantum handshakes.</p><p>To manage this diversity without the risk of breaking connections, we relied on <i>HelloRetryRequest</i>. Instead of sending post-quantum keyshare immediately in the <i>ClientHello</i>, we only advertise support for it. If the origin server supports the post-quantum key agreement, it uses <i>HelloRetryRequest</i> to request it from Cloudflare, and creates the post-quantum connection. The downside is this extra round trip (from the retry) cancels out the performance gains of TLS 1.3 and makes the connection feel closer to TLS 1.2 for uncached requests.</p><p>Back in 2023, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/post-quantum-cryptography/pqc-to-origin/\"><u>we launched an API endpoint</u></a>, so customers could manually opt their origins into preferring post-quantum connections. If set, we avoid the extra roundtrip and try to create a post-quantum connection at the start of the TLS session. Similarly, we extended post-quantum protection to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-tunnel/\"><u>Cloudflare tunnel</u></a>, making it one of the easiest ways to get origin-facing PQ today.</p><p><b>Starting Q4 2025, we’re taking the next step – making it </b><b><i>automatic</i></b><b>. </b>Just as we’ve done with SSL/TLS upgrades, Automatic SSL/TLS will begin testing, ramping, and enabling post-quantum handshakes with origins—without requiring customers to change a thing, as long as their origins support post-quantum key agreement.</p><p>Behind the scenes, we’re already scanning active origins about every 24 hours to test support and preferences for both classical and post-quantum key agreements. We’ve worked directly with vendors and customers to identify compatibility issues, and this new scanning system will be fully integrated into <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/#automatic-ssltls-default\"><u>Automatic SSL/TLS</u></a>.</p><p>And the benefits won&#39;t stop at post-quantum. Even for classical handshakes, optimization matters. Today, the X25519 algorithm is used by default, but <b>our scanning data shows that more than 6% of origins currently prefer a different key agreement algorithm, </b>which leads to unnecessary <i>HelloRetryRequests </i>and wasted round trips<b>.</b> By folding this scanning data into Automatic SSL/TLS, we’ll improve connection establishment for classical TLS as well—squeezing out extra speed and reliability across the board.</p><p>As enterprises and hosting providers adopt PQC, our preliminary scanning pipeline has already found that <b>around 4% of origins could benefit from a post-quantum-preferred key agreement even today</b>, as shown below. This is an 8x increase since <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-to-origins/\"><u>we started our scans in 2023</u></a>. We expect this number to grow at a steady pace as the industry continues to migrate to post-quantum protocols.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3g2Um1vTz6cuCtoYWtMU4C/7551fb50305a8512fa7cc22844024b99/8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"958\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>As part of this change, we will also<b> phase out</b> support for the pre-standard version X25519Kyber768 to support the final ML-KEM standard, again using a hybrid, from edge to origin connections.</p><p>With Automatic SSL/TLS, we will soon by default scan your origins proactively to directly send the most preferred keyshare to your origin removing the need for any extra roundtrip, improving both security and performance of your origin connections collectively.</p><p>At Cloudflare, we’ve always believed security is a right, not a privilege. From Universal SSL to post-quantum cryptography, our mission has been to make the strongest protections free and available to everyone. <b>Automatic SSL/TLS</b> is the next step—upgrading every domain to the best protocols automatically. Check the SSL/TLS section of your dashboard to ensure it’s enabled and join the millions of sites already secured for today and ready for tomorrow.</p>",
