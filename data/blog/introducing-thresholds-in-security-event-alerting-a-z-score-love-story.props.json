Previously, our calculations were based on z-score methodology alone, which was able to determine most of the significant spikes. By introducing a threshold, we are able to make alerts more accurate and only notify you when it truly matters. One can think of it as a romance between the two strategies. This is the story of how they met.</p><p>Author’s note: as an intern at Cloudflare I got to work on this project from start to finish from investigation all the way to the final product.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"once-upon-a-time\">Once upon a time</h3>\n            <a href=\"#once-upon-a-time\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In the beginning, there were Security Event Alerts. Security Event Alerts are notifications that are sent whenever we detect a threat to your Internet property. As the name suggests, they track the number of security events, which are requests to your application that match security rules. For example, you can configure a security rule that blocks access from certain countries. Every time a user from that country tries to access your Internet property, it will log as a security event. While a security event may be harmless and fired as a result of the natural flow of traffic, it is important to alert on instances when a rule is fired more times than usual. Anomalous spikes of too many security events in a short period of time can indicate an attack. To find these anomalies and distinguish between the natural number of security events and that which poses a threat, we need a good strategy.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-lonely-life-of-a-z-score\">The lonely life of a z-score</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-lonely-life-of-a-z-score\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Before a threshold entered the picture, our strategy worked only on the basis of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score\">z-score</a>. Z-score is a methodology that looks at the number of standard deviations a certain data point is from the mean. In our current configuration, if a spike crosses the z-score value of 3.5, we send you an alert. This value was decided on after careful analysis of our customers’ data, finding it the most effective in determining a legitimate alert. Any lower and notifications will get noisy for smaller spikes. Any higher and we may miss out on significant events. You can read more about our z-score methodology in this <a href=\"/get-notified-when-your-site-is-under-attack/\">blog post</a>.</p><p>The following graphs are an example of how the z-score method works. The first graph shows the number of security events over time, with a recent spike.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7EnlNMeKzVeZ13Q0M2Mxcx/95d1c73e1e1c29fe41963ea5420d56f5/image3-9.png\" alt=\"A graph of the number of security rules broken over time with a big recent spike.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>To determine whether this spike is significant, we calculate the z-score and check if the value is above 3.5:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/40S18LfgnqtBqZRA3zMT3r/b84867f155f9b17e34374ce9e6407ba7/image4-3.png\" alt=\"A graph of z-score values over time with a big recent spike\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As the graph shows, the deviation is above 3.5 and so an alert is triggered.</p><p>However, relying on z-score becomes tricky for domains that experience no security events for a long period of time. With many security events at zero, the mean and standard deviation depress to zero as well. When a non-zero value finally appears, it will always be infinite standard deviations away from the mean. As a result, it will always trigger an alert even on spikes that do not pose any threat to your domain, such as the below:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/iGehGRFNnvEfKjmkZEWNm/d6227436d31a3090953106e3fa726098/image8.png\" alt=\"A graph of the number of security rules broken over time with a recent spike of five security events\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>With five security events, you are likely going to ignore this spike, as it is too low to indicate a meaningful threat. However, the z-score in this instance will be infinite:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3j3tRLJgHkuLdmFb9YWZOt/b78a7788fcd999eb3889b3c7cddc512e/image5-3.png\" alt=\"A graph of z-score values over time with a recent spike to infinity\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Since a z-score of infinity is greater than 3.5, an alert will be triggered.

With the z-score at zero, it will no longer trigger an alert on the harmless spike!</p><p>But what about spikes that could be harmful?

This <a href=\"/smarter-origin-service-level-monitoring/\">blog post</a> describes in more detail why thresholds alone do not work. However, when paired with z-score, they are able to share their strengths and cover for each other&#39;s weaknesses. If the z-score falsely detects an insignificant spike, the threshold will stop the alert from triggering. Conversely, if a value does cross the security events threshold, the z-score ensures there is a reasonable variance from the data average before allowing an alert to be sent.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-invaluable-value\">The invaluable value</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-invaluable-value\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>To foster a successful relationship between the z-score and security events threshold, we needed to determine the most effective threshold value.
