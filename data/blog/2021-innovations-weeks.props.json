The Internet wasn’t built with security in mind, but the products and partnerships announced this week continued Cloudflare’s core mission of helping build a better Internet—one that companies of all sizes can plug into and be protected by default from the types of attacks that have historically resulted in loss of data, computing resources, and customer confidence.</p><p>At the start of the week, we took on the task of replacing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mpls/\">MPLS</a>, the core network technology that many organizations use to connect their offices and data centers, with a <a href=\"https://t.co/Bn2aMflr3P\">more secure and cost-effective alternative</a>. Next, we tackled the biggest risk to everyday users of the web by <a href=\"https://t.co/v6ZYtjJOhJ\">opening our remote browser isolation technology to teams of all sizes</a> and <a href=\"/introducing-page-shield/\">protecting against malicious code injection</a>. Following those announcements, we inverted the slow, network chokepoint model of data loss prevention <a href=\"/data-loss-prevention/\">by building zero trust controls over data directly into every aspect of the Cloudflare One suite</a>. And to round out the week, we <a href=\"/super-bot-fight-mode/\">democratized access to bot-fighting technology previously only available to the largest enterprises</a> while also  <a href=\"/api-abuse-detection/\">deepening our solutions for novel threats facing APIs</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/tag/security-week/\">View all Security Week 2021 Blog Posts</a><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/search/security%20week\">View all Security Week 2021 Cloudflare TV Series</a></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2BQdyz2bOTpK1EVc40JpH3/e9c46de66545a2bb7ae73f631fdc03e0/image3-9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"april-11-17-2021\"><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-week/\">Developer Week</a> April 11-17, 2021</h3>\n            <a href=\"#april-11-17-2021\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><b>Alyson Cabral</b></p><p>With Developer Week, we had one focus – to make developers’ lives easier.

We launched the company 11 years ago: September 27, 2010. It has been our tradition, since our first birthday, to use this week to launch innovative products that we think of as our gift back to the Internet. In 2021, we announced <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/\">Cloudflare R2</a>, our object-based storage with no egress fees, tackled solutions to <a href=\"/tackling-email-spoofing/\">Email Spoofing and Phishing</a>, shared how we are <a href=\"/cloudflare-for-offices/\">expanding our network into office buildings</a> as well as many more product announcements and Cloudflare TV executive fireside chats and product discussions.</p><p><a href=\"/tag/birthday-week/\">View all Birthday Week Blog Posts</a><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/search/birthday%20week\">View all Birthday Week Cloudflare TV Series</a></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1niM8X9rDPCPlsmK2RmLPk/637458e5d7c433d4fe91bdfb3c00f8e4/image5-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"nov-14-19-2021\"><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/full-stack-week/\">Full Stack Week</a> Nov 14-19, 2021</h3>\n            <a href=\"#nov-14-19-2021\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><b>Rita Kozlov</b></p><p>During <a href=\"/full-stack-week-2021/\">Full Stack Week</a>, we brought the vision of the <a href=\"/the-network-is-the-computer/\">Network is the Computer</a> to life — allowing developers to build their entire application on our network, soup to nuts. Over the course of the week, we made a series of announcements, each providing another critical piece of the puzzle, necessary to build a full stack application.</p><p>We started with the foundation — data, announcing the <a href=\"/durable-objects-ga/\">general availability of Durable Objects</a>, and ability to <a href=\"/relational-database-connectors/\">connect to databases</a>, alongside <a href=\"/workers-adds-support-for-two-modern-data-platforms-mongodb-atlas-and-prisma/\">partnerships with MongoDB and Prisma</a>. <a href=\"https://pages.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Pages</a>, our Jamstack platform also took a step deeper down the stack by introducing support for seamless <a href=\"/cloudflare-pages-goes-full-stack/\">deployment of functions</a>. We want development on our platform to be an enjoyable experience, so we announced the <a href=\"/wrangler-v2-beta/\">new version of wrangler</a>, our CLI, and <a href=\"/introducing-worker-services/\">Services</a>, a better way for teams to build applications. And while we want developers to have fun, we also want them to be able to monetize their efforts, which they now can do using the <a href=\"/announcing-stripe-support-in-workers/\">Stripe SDK</a> on Workers.</p><p><a href=\"/tag/full-stack-week/\">View all Full Stack Week 2021 Blog Posts</a><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/full-stack-week\">View all Full Stack Week Cloudflare TV Series</a></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5gNIeUhsNURRmDUWg4T8ET/cacd82453ccc91d7ebb1c07929d0011d/image7-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"dec-5-10-2021\"><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/cio-week/\">CIO Week</a> Dec 5-10, 2021</h3>\n            <a href=\"#dec-5-10-2021\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><b>Annika Garbers</b></p><p>To wrap up the year, we <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/interactive-demo/\">demonstrated</a> how Cloudflare One, our Zero Trust <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/network-as-a-service-naas/\">Network-as-a-Service</a>, is helping Chief Information Officers transform their corporate networks.
