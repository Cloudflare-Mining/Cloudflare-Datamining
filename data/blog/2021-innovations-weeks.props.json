The Internet wasn’t built with security in mind, but the products and partnerships announced this week continued Cloudflare’s core mission of helping build a better Internet—one that companies of all sizes can plug into and be protected by default from the types of attacks that have historically resulted in loss of data, computing resources, and customer confidence.</p><p>At the start of the week, we took on the task of replacing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mpls/\">MPLS</a>, the core network technology that many organizations use to connect their offices and data centers, with a <a href=\"https://t.co/Bn2aMflr3P\">more secure and cost-effective alternative</a>. Next, we tackled the biggest risk to everyday users of the web by <a href=\"https://t.co/v6ZYtjJOhJ\">opening our remote browser isolation technology to teams of all sizes</a> and <a href=\"/introducing-page-shield/\">protecting against malicious code injection</a>. Following those announcements, we inverted the slow, network chokepoint model of data loss prevention <a href=\"/data-loss-prevention/\">by building zero trust controls over data directly into every aspect of the Cloudflare One suite</a>. And to round out the week, we <a href=\"/super-bot-fight-mode/\">democratized access to bot-fighting technology previously only available to the largest enterprises</a> while also  <a href=\"/api-abuse-detection/\">deepening our solutions for novel threats facing APIs</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/tag/security-week/\">View all Security Week 2021 Blog Posts</a><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/search/security%20week\">View all Security Week 2021 Cloudflare TV Series</a></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2BQdyz2bOTpK1EVc40JpH3/01b2cd985b532761f87c38e02eb969d3/image3-9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-week/\">Developer Week</a> April 11-17, 2021</h3><p><b>Alyson Cabral</b></p><p>With Developer Week, we had one focus – to make developers’ lives easier.

Each day, a new challenge was announced to encourage developers from across the globe to level up their skills by trying new features and approaches. Solutions were revealed the following day, with the <a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/event/TUlc16pW13ou8en25LKE2\">bonus round solution</a> wrapping up the week.

Impact Week highlighted some of the things we are doing as a company around environmental, social and governance initiatives. We launched <a href=\"/pangea/\">Project Pangea</a>, a free program to provide secure, reliable access to the Internet for community networks that support under-served communities. We also shared how we are <a href=\"/helping-build-a-green-internet/\">committed to helping build a green Internet</a> through efficiency, renewable energy, and providing developers a choice to run their workloads in the most energy efficient data centers. In addition, we published our <a href=\"/cloudflare-human-rights-commitments/\">first human rights policy</a> in order to better serve our mission and core values.</p><p><a href=\"/tag/impact-week/\">View all Impact Week 2021 Blog Posts</a><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/impact-week\">View all Impact Week 2021 Cloudflare TV Series</a></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2OwMz4DP2R3xg6AZzuAhAy/d3a6f1d47c3432afef057a64e43e8b93/image8-11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/speed-week/\">Speed Week</a> Sept 12-17, 2021</h3><p><b>Marc Lamik</b></p><p>Helping make the Internet faster is one of Cloudflare’s core priorities.

We want development on our platform to be an enjoyable experience, so we announced the <a href=\"/wrangler-v2-beta/\">new version of wrangler</a>, our CLI, and <a href=\"/introducing-worker-services/\">Services</a>, a better way for teams to build applications.
