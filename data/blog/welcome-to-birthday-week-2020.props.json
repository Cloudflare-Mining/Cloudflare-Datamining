This was the first of a long line of announcements that support our goal of making available to everyone the latest technologies. If you’ve been following Cloudflare’s growth you’ll know those include <a href=\"/introducing-spdy/\">SPDY</a>/<a href=\"/introducing-http2/\">HTTP/2</a>, <a href=\"/introducing-tls-1-3/\">TLS 1.3</a>, <a href=\"/head-start-with-quic/\">QUIC</a>/<a href=\"/http-3-from-root-to-tip/\">HTTP/3</a>, <a href=\"/dns-encryption-explained/\">DoH and DoT</a>, <a href=\"/a-very-webp-new-year-from-cloudflare/\">WebP</a>, … At two years old we celebrated with <a href=\"/happy-birthday-cloudflare/\">a timeline of our first two years</a> and the fact that we’d reached 500,000 domains using the service. A year later <a href=\"/cloudflare-happy-3rd-birthday/\">that number had tripled</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2jU72IZv2D6UPm5V1rI78/5b2b80d25fa256c2828dd6ed17bedb46/image7-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"731\" height=\"685\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In 2014 we released <a href=\"/introducing-universal-ssl/\">Universal SSL</a> and gave all our customers SSL certificates.

And, last but not least, our hugely popular serverless platform <a href=\"/introducing-cloudflare-workers/\">Cloudflare Workers</a>.
