I am encouraged by what we are building while being even more motivated by what lies ahead for our customers, our partners and our employees.</p><p>Cloudflare has a rich history in EMEA where London was one of the earliest bases for both the company’s engineering and also its customer-facing activities. In the subsequent years, we have expanded our customer-facing activity to include coverage into all the major EMEA countries and regions. We’ve built up a team of professional sales and business development people, capable systems engineers, dedicated customer success managers, thoughtful marketeers and a responsive customer support team who serve our existing customers and develop new ones as a committed and focused team.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/o1QypOMzbxtyPUO2dK29N/3756388520c58dd250081d7fdea337ed/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We work on developing brand awareness for Cloudflare and extending our reach into the market through communications, events and most of all through ongoing close engagement with customers, prospective customers and partners.

Building on Cloudflare’s usual strengths around securing and making more performant our customers’ websites and digital assets, we are increasingly having new conversations with customers in their key areas of their innovation. For example, many companies in EMEA are at the forefront of the trend towards serverless computing and Cloudflare is enabling them on that path with Cloudflare Workers.  </p><p>Another area of focus is corporate security including identity and access management where Cloudflare Access is being deployed by a number of forward-looking organisations. Customers using additional network protocols such as UDP in the gaming industry and TCP in financial trading markets are leveraging Cloudflare’s Spectrum capability for enhanced security and network traffic handling. This exciting progress is leading our customers to enjoy increasing breadth of usage and strategic value from Cloudflare’s solutions.</p><p>On the security and privacy front, in the European market in particular, there is a strong focus on data privacy and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulations).  Cloudflare is closely engaged with policymakers at the European Union in Brussels to align with and influence these important policy developments.</p><p>Our customers continue to be from digital, online, born on the web/cloud sectors while increasingly we are also adding customers from more traditional corporate, and in many cases global, environments where Cloud-based services are seeing rapid adoption as these customers go through digital transformation. Multi-cloud is also an important theme in particular with larger customers who are diversifying away from a single Cloud provider. Cloudflare is well placed to serve customer needs around all these trends.</p><p>Here are a few of our exciting EMEA customer stories:  </p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/ao-com-video/\">AO.com</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/allsaints-performance-security/\">AllSaints</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/auto-trader-on-premises-cloud-migration/\">AutoTrader</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/debijenkorf/\">Debijenkorf</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/eurovision/\">Eurovision</a></p></li><li><p>Le Cab</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/rte/\">RTE</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/\">All</a></p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"our-cloudflare-customer-facing-team-in-emea\">Our Cloudflare customer facing team in EMEA</h3>\n      <a href=\"#our-cloudflare-customer-facing-team-in-emea\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>London continues to be the base camp for our activities where we have a customer facing the team of approximately 100 people carrying out our activities supporting and developing customers.
