With Zaraz, Cloudflare customers can easily transition to server-side data collection with just a few clicks, without the need to set up and maintain their own cloud environment or make additional changes to their website for installation. Server-side data collection, as facilitated by Zaraz, simplifies analytics reporting from the server rather than loading numerous JavaScript files on the user&#39;s browser. It&#39;s a rapidly growing trend due to browser limitations on using third-party solutions and cookies. The result is significantly faster websites, plus enhanced security and privacy on the web.</p><p>We&#39;ve had Zaraz in beta mode for a year and a half now. Throughout this time, we&#39;ve dedicated our efforts to meeting as many customers as we could, gathering feedback, and getting a deep understanding of our users&#39; needs before addressing them. We&#39;ve been shipping features at a high rate and have now reached a stage where our product is robust, flexible, and competitive. It also offers unique features not found elsewhere, thanks to being built on Cloudflare’s global network, such as Zaraz’s <a href=\"/dynamic-data-collection-with-zaraz-worker-variables/\">Worker Variables</a>. We have cultivated a strong and vibrant discord community, and we have certified <a href=\"https://www.credly.com/org/cloudflare/badge/cloudflare-zaraz-certified-developer\">Zaraz developers</a> ready to help anyone with implementation and configuration.</p><p>With more than 25,000 websites running Zaraz today - from personal sites to those of some of the world&#39;s biggest companies - we feel confident it&#39;s time to go out of beta, and introduce our new pricing system. We believe this pricing is not only generous to our customers, but also competitive and sustainable. We view this as the next logical step in our ongoing commitment to our customers, for whom we&#39;re building the future.</p><p>If you&#39;re building a web application, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ve spent at least some time implementing third-party tools for analytics, marketing performance, conversion optimization, A/B testing, customer experience and more. Indeed, according to the <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/third-parties\">Web Almanac</a> report, 94% percent of mobile pages used at least one third-party solution in 2022, and third-party requests accounted for 45% of all requests made by websites. It&#39;s clear that third-party solutions are everywhere. They have become an integral part of how the web has evolved. Third-party tools are here to stay, and they require effective developer solutions. We are building Zaraz to help developers manage the third-party layer of their website properly.</p><p>Starting today, Cloudflare Zaraz is available to everyone for free under their Cloudflare dashboard, and the paid version of Zaraz is included in the Workers Paid plan. The <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/\">Free plan</a> is designed to meet the needs of most developers who want to use Zaraz for personal use cases. For a price starting at $5/month, customers of the Workers Paid plan can enjoy the extensive list of features that makes Zaraz powerful, deploy Zaraz on their professional projects, and utilize the pay-as-you-go system. This is in addition to everything else included in the Workers Paid plan. The <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/\">Enterprise plan</a>, on the other hand, addresses the needs of larger businesses looking to leverage our platform to its fullest potential.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"how-is-zaraz-priced\">How is Zaraz priced</h2>\n            <a href=\"#how-is-zaraz-priced\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Zaraz pricing is based on two components: Zaraz Loads and the set of features.
