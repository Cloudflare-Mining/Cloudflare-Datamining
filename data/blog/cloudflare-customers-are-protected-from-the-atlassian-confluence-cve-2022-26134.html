	<p>Updated on 3rd of June: amended information according to Atlassian’s official advisory update.</p>
	<p>On June 2, 2022 Atlassian released a security advisory for their <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2022-06-02-1130377146.html">Confluence Server and Data Center</a> applications, highlighting a critical severity unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability is as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26134">CVE-2022-26134</a> and &nbsp;impacts all versions of Confluence Server and Data Center versions greater than 1.3.0.</p>
	<p>Atlassian has released a patch and all Confluence customers should update immediately to the latest version available from the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives">official download center</a>.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare customers using either <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf">WAF</a> or Access are already protected. Atlassian also recommends implementing a WAF rule that blocks URLs containing <code>${</code> as it &nbsp;may reduce risk of being compromised.  </p>
	<p>Our own Confluence nodes are protected by both WAF and Access, and at the time of writing, we have found no evidence that our Confluence instance was exploited.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare reviewed the security advisory, conducted our own analysis, and prepared a WAF mitigation rule via an emergency release. The rule, once tested, was deployed on June 2, 2022, at 23:38 UTC with a default action of BLOCK and the following IDs:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>100531 (for our legacy WAF)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>408cff2b &nbsp;(for our new WAF)</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All websites, including free customers using the Cloudflare WAF to protect their self-hosted Confluence applications have automatically been protected since the new rule was deployed.</p>
	<p>Customers who have deployed Cloudflare Access in front of their Confluence applications were protected from external exploitation attempts even before the emergency release. Access verifies every request made to a Confluence application to ensure it is coming from an authenticated user. Any unauthenticated users attempting this exploit would have been blocked by Cloudflare before they could reach the Confluence server.</p>
	<p>Customers not yet using <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust">zero trust</a> rules to protect access to their applications can <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps">follow these instructions</a> to enable Access now in a few minutes.</p>
