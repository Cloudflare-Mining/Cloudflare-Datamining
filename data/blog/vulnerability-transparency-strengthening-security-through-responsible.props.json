At Cloudflare, we understand the responsibility that comes with operating in a connected world. As part of our ongoing commitment to security and transparency, Cloudflare is proud to have joined the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/\"><u>United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA)</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge\"><u>“Secure by Design” pledge</u></a> in May 2024. </p><p>By signing this pledge, Cloudflare joins a growing coalition of companies committed to strengthening the resilience of the digital ecosystem. This isn’t just symbolic — it&#39;s a concrete step in aligning with cybersecurity best practices and our commitment to protect our customers, partners, and data. </p><p>A central goal in CISA’s Secure by Design pledge is promoting transparency in vulnerability reporting. This initiative underscores the importance of proactive security practices and emphasizes transparency in vulnerability management — values that are deeply embedded in Cloudflare’s Product Security program. ​We believe that openness around vulnerabilities is foundational to earning and maintaining the trust of our customers, partners, and the broader security community.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"why-transparency-in-vulnerability-reporting-matters\">Why transparency in vulnerability reporting matters</h2>\n      <a href=\"#why-transparency-in-vulnerability-reporting-matters\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Transparency in vulnerability reporting is essential for building trust between companies and customers. In 2008, Linus Torvalds <a href=\"https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/7/15/293\"><u>noted</u></a> that disclosure is inherently tied to resolution: “<i>So as far as I&#39;m concerned, disclosing is the fixing of the bug</i>”, emphasizing that resolution must start with visibility. While this mindset might apply well to open-source projects and communities familiar with code and patches, it doesn’t scale easily to non-expert users and enterprise users who require structured, validated, and clearly communicated disclosures regarding a vulnerability’s impact. Today’s threat landscape demands not only rapid remediation of vulnerabilities but also clear disclosure of their nature, impact and resolution. This builds trust with the customer and contributes to the broader collective understanding of common vulnerability classes and emerging systemic flaws.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"what-is-a-cve\">What is a CVE?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#what-is-a-cve\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a catalog of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and exposures.

CVE transparency is not a one-time initiative — it’s a sustained effort rooted in openness, discipline, and technical excellence.
