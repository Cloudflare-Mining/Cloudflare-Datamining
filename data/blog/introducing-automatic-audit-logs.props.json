That&#39;s why we&#39;re making them &quot;automatic&quot; — eliminating the need for individual Cloudflare product teams to manually send events.

This new system is designed to give you a complete and consistent view of your environment’s activity. Here’s how we’ve enhanced our audit logging capabilities:</p><ul><li><p><b>Standardized logging: </b>Previously, audit logs generation was dependent on separate internal teams, which could lead to gaps and inconsistencies. Now, audit logs are automatically produced in a seamless and standardized way, eliminating reliance on individual teams and ensuring consistency across all Cloudflare services.</p></li><li><p><b>Expanded Product Coverage: </b>Automatic Audit Logs now extend our coverage from 62 to 111 products, boosting overall coverage from 75% to 95%. We now capture actions from key endpoints such as the <code>/accounts</code>, <code>/zones</code>, and <code>/organizations</code> APIs.</p></li><li><p><b>Granular Filtering: </b>With uniformly formatted logs, you can quickly pinpoint specific actions, users, methods, and resources, making investigations faster and more efficient.</p></li><li><p><b>Enhanced Context and Transparency: </b>Each log entry includes detailed context like the authentication method used, whether the action was performed via the API or Dashboard, and mappings to Cloudflare Ray IDs for better traceability.</p></li><li><p><b>Comprehensive Activity Capture: </b>In addition to create, edit, and delete actions, the system now records GET requests and failed attempts, ensuring that no critical activity goes unnoticed.</p></li></ul><p>This new system reflects Cloudflare&#39;s commitment to building a safer, more transparent Internet. It also supports Cloudflare&#39;s pledge to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-by-design-principles/\"><u>CISA’s Cybersecurity Commitment</u></a>, reinforcing our dedication to increase our customers’ ability to gather evidence of cybersecurity intrusions.</p><p>Automatic Audit Logs (beta release) is available exclusively through the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/audit_logs/methods/list/\"><u>API</u></a>. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"the-journey-of-an-audit-log-how-cloudflare-creates-reliable-secure-records\">The journey of an audit log: how Cloudflare creates reliable, secure records</h2>\n      <a href=\"#the-journey-of-an-audit-log-how-cloudflare-creates-reliable-secure-records\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>At Cloudflare, we’ve always made audit logs available through the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/audit_logs/methods/list/\"><u>Audit Log API</u></a>, but the experience has not been very consistent.</p><p>Why?

OpenAPI is a widely adopted, machine-readable, and human-friendly specification format that is used to define HTTP APIs.

The system checks the cache for responses first and if unavailable, it fetches the data from internal services and caches it for future use.</p><p>Once the audit logs are fully transformed and enriched, they are stored in a database in batches to prevent overwhelming the system. For the beta release, we are storing 30 days of audit logs in the database. This will be extended to 18 months for our GA (General Availability) release in the second half of 2025.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"sample-audit-log\">Sample audit log</h3>\n      <a href=\"#sample-audit-log\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Here is a complete sample audit log generated when an alert notification policy is updated.
