Regional traffic insights bring a more localized perspective to the traffic trends shown on Radar.</p><p>Second, we’re adding detailed <a href=\"#introducing-certificate-transparency-insights-on-radar\"><u>Certificate Transparency (CT) data</u></a>, too. The new CT data builds on the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/certificate-transparency/\"><u>work that Cloudflare has been doing around CT</u></a> since 2018, including <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-tour-through-merkle-town-cloudflares-ct-ecosystem-dashboard/\"><u>Merkle Town</u></a>, our initial CT dashboard.</p><p>Both features extend Radar&#39;s mission of providing deeper, more granular visibility into the health and security of the Internet.

It’s visible on Radar. Just a year and a half later, in March 2022, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/asn-on-radar/\"><u>we launched Autonomous System (ASN) pages on Radar</u></a>. This has enabled us to bring more granular visibility to many of our metrics: What’s network performance like on <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/quality/as701\"><u>AS701 (Verizon Fios)</u></a>? How thoroughly has <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as812#routing-statistics\"><u>AS812 (Rogers Communications)</u></a> implemented routing security? Did <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/as58322?dateStart=2025-08-28&dateEnd=2025-09-03\"><u>AS58322 (Halasat)</u></a> just go offline? It’s all visible on Radar.</p><p>However, sometimes Internet usage shifts on a more local level — maybe a sporting event in a particular region drives people online to find out more information. Or maybe a storm or other natural disaster causes infrastructure damage and power outages in a given state, impacting Internet traffic.</p><p>For the last few years, the Radar team relied on internal data sets and <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\"><u>Jupyter</u></a> notebooks to visualize these “sub-national” traffic shifts. But today, we are bringing that insight to Cloudflare Radar, and to you, with the launch of regional traffic insights. With this new capability, you’ll be able to see traffic trends at a more local level, including bytes and requests, as well as breakouts of desktop/mobile device and bot/human traffic shares. And for even more granular visibility, within the Data Explorer, you’ll also be able to select an autonomous system to join with the regional selection — for example, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=netflows&loc=6254926&dt=7d&asn=as7922\"><u>looking at AS7922 (Comcast) in Massachusetts (United States)</u></a>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"geographic-guidance\">Geographic guidance</h3>\n      <a href=\"#geographic-guidance\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In line with common industry practice, the region names displayed on Radar are sourced in data from GeoNames (<a href=\"http://geonames.org\"><u>geonames.org</u></a>), a crowdsourced geographical database.

With the new regional views, this impact now becomes even clearer at a more local level. For instance, mobile devices account for, on average, just over half of the request traffic seen from <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/184742?dateStart=2025-08-22&dateEnd=2025-09-04#mobile-vs-desktop\"><u>Nairobi Country in Kenya</u></a>. A clear diurnal pattern is seen on weekdays, where mobile device usage drops during workday hours, and then rises again in the evening. However, during the weekends, mobile traffic remains elevated, presumably due to fewer people using desktop computers in office environments, as well as fewer desktop computers in use at home, in line with Kenya’s <a href=\"https://www.ca.go.ke/mobile-data-and-digital-services-rise-ca-report-shows\"><u>mobile-first</u></a> culture.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5QgT4OGpdgvXiQJX8GbzEP/62947e34d96bdf85a863f3396f95b094/image17.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"876\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"bot-vs-human-traffic-trends\">Bot vs human traffic trends</h3>\n      <a href=\"#bot-vs-human-traffic-trends\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Similar to how the mobile vs. desktop view exposes shifts in human activity, bot vs. human traffic insights do as well.

However, since the graph shows traffic shares, and given the timing of the apparent increases, the more likely cause is increasingly larger drops in human-driven traffic – users in Lisbon appear to begin logging off around 23:00 UTC (midnight local time), and start getting back online around 05:00 UTC (06:00 local time). The shares and shifts will obviously vary by country and region, but they can provide a perspective on the nocturnal habits of users in a region.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/36GundkM2BKTWvCq7T7On2/a5028340a0e8b3a55f85df8116a6a7fe/image16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"876\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"customize-regional-analysis-with-radars-data-explorer\">Customize regional analysis with Radar’s Data Explorer</h3>\n      <a href=\"#customize-regional-analysis-with-radars-data-explorer\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Within the Data Explorer, you can use the breakdown options and filters to customize your analysis of regional traffic data.</p><p>At a country level, choosing to breakdown by regions generates a stacked area graph that shows the relative traffic shares of the top 20 regions in the selected country, along with a bar graph showing summary share values.

Clients that enforce CT (most major browsers) will only trust a website certificate if it is both signed by a trusted CA <i>and</i> has proof that the certificate has been added to a public, append-only CT log, so that it can be publicly audited. Only recently, CT played a key role in detecting the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/unauthorized-issuance-of-certificates-for-1-1-1-1/\"><u>unauthorized issuance of certificates for 1.1.1.1</u></a>, a <a href=\"https://one.one.one.one/\"><u>public DNS resolver service</u></a> that Cloudflare operates.</p><p>In addition to its role as a vital safety mechanism for the Internet, CT has proven to be invaluable in other ways, as it provides publicly-accessible lists of <i>all website certificates used on the Internet</i>. This dataset is a treasure trove of intelligence for researchers measuring the Internet, security teams detecting malicious activity like phishing campaigns, or penetration testers mapping a target’s external attack surface.</p><p>The sheer amount of data (multiple terabytes) available in CT makes it difficult for regular Internet users to download and explore themselves.

Because the same certificate can appear multiple times within a single log or be submitted to several logs, the total count can be inflated. To address this, two distinct lines are shown: one for total entries and another for unique entries. Uniqueness, however, is calculated only within the selected time range — for example, if certificate C is added to log A in one period and to log B in another, it will appear in the unique count for both periods. It is also important to note that the CT charts and date filters use the log timestamp, which is the time a certificate was added to a CT log. Additionally, the data displayed on the page was collected from the logs monitored by Cloudflare — delays, backlogs, or other inconsistencies may exist, so <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/about\"><u>please report</u></a> any issues or discrepancies.</p><p>Alongside this chart is a comparison between <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/certificate-transparency#entry-type\"><u>certificates and pre-certificates</u></a>. A <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962#section-3.1\"><u>pre-certificate</u></a> is a special type of certificate used in CT that allows a CA to publicly log a certificate before it is officially issued.

Starting with the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/certificate-transparency?dateRange=7d#public-key-algorithm\"><u>public key algorithm</u></a>, which defines how secure connections are established between clients and servers, we found that more than 65% of certificates still use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem\"><u>RSA</u></a>, while the remainder use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm\"><u>ECDSA</u></a>. RSA remains dominant due to its long-standing compatibility with a wide range of clients, while ECDSA is increasingly adopted for its efficiency and smaller key sizes, which can improve performance and reduce computational overhead. In the coming years, we expect <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/\"><u>post-quantum signature algorithms</u></a> like ML-DSA to appear when public CAs begin to offer support.</p><p>Next, a breakdown of certificates by <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/certificate-transparency?dateRange=7d#signature-algorithm\"><u>signature algorithm</u></a> reveals how Certificate Authorities (CAs) sign the certificates they issue. Most certificates (over 65%) use RSA with SHA-256, followed by ECDSA with SHA-384 at 19%, ECDSA with SHA-256 at 12%, and a small fraction using other algorithms. The choice of signature algorithm reflects a balance between widespread support, security, and performance, with stronger algorithms like ECDSA gradually gaining traction for modern deployments.</p><p>Certificates are also categorized by <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/certificate-transparency?dateRange=7d#validation-level\"><u>validation level</u></a>, which reflects the degree to which the CA has verified the identity of the certificate requester. The <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/types-of-ssl-certificates/\"><u>main validation types</u></a> are Domain Validation (DV), Organization Validation (OV), and Extended Validation (EV). DV certificates verify only control of the domain, OV certificates verify both domain control and the organization behind it, and EV certificates involve more rigorous checks and display additional identity information in browsers.
