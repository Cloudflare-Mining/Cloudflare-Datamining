Most types of DDoS attacks can be mitigated by finding unique characteristics that are present in all attack packets and using that to distinguish ‘good’ packets from the ‘bad’ ones. This is called &quot;stateless&quot; mitigation, because any packet that has these unique characteristics can simply be dropped without remembering any information (or &quot;state&quot;) about the other packets that came before it. However, when attack packets have no unique characteristics, then &quot;stateful&quot; mitigation is required, because whether a certain packet is good or bad depends on the other packets that have come before it.</p><p>The most sophisticated types of TCP flood require stateful mitigation, where every TCP connection must be tracked in order to know whether any particular TCP packet is part of an active connection. That kind of mitigation is called &quot;flow tracking&quot;, and it is typically implemented in Linux by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables\">iptables</a> conntrack module. However, DDoS protection with conntrack is not as simple as flipping the iptable switch, especially at the scale and complexity that Cloudflare operates in. If you&#39;re interested to learn more, in <a href=\"/conntrack-tales-one-thousand-and-one-flows/\">this</a> blog we talk about the technical challenges of implementing iptables conntrack.</p><p>Complex TCP DDoS attacks pose a threat as they can be harder to detect and mitigate. They therefore have the potential to cause service degradation, outages and increased false positives with inaccurate mitigation rules. So how does Cloudflare block patternless DDoS attacks without affecting legitimate traffic?</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"bidirectional-tcp-flow-tracking\">Bidirectional TCP Flow Tracking</h3>\n            <a href=\"#bidirectional-tcp-flow-tracking\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Using Cloudflare&#39;s traditional products, HTTP applications can be protected by the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/\">WAF</a> service, and TCP/UDP applications can be protected by <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-spectrum/\">Spectrum</a>. These services are &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/\">reverse proxies</a>&quot;, meaning that traffic passes through Cloudflare in both directions. In this bidirectional topology, we see the entire TCP flow (i.e., segments sent by both the client and the server) and can therefore track the state of the underlying TCP connection. This way, we know if a TCP packet belongs to an existing flow or if it is an “out of state” TCP packet.
