But what about the coronation of a king or queen? There’s no similar precedent, with a worldwide impact, in the Internet age, except maybe the coronation of the king of Thailand, in 2019. The last time it happened in the United Kingdom was 70 years ago (June 2, 1953), with Queen Elizabeth II; it was the first British coronation to be fully televised. Neither the Internet nor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET\">ARPANET</a> were around at the time.</p><p>Imagine a grand royal event (if you saw the broadcast or the news, there’s no need), filled with pomp and pageantry, that&#39;s so captivating it impacts Internet traffic. That&#39;s what happened during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_Charles_III_and_Camilla\">coronation</a> of Charles III and Camilla, the newly crowned king and queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. As the coronation ceremony unfolded, on Saturday morning, May 6, 2023, there were clear spikes and dips in traffic, each coinciding with key moments of the ceremony.</p><p>Then came Sunday, and with it, the Coronation Big Lunch event. As the nation sat down to enjoy a communal meal throughout the country, Internet traffic took a significant nosedive, dropping by as much as 18%. The Sunday trends didn&#39;t stop there. As night fell and Prince William took to the stage to deliver a speech during the Coronation Concert, there was a clear drop in Internet traffic. Monday, May 8, was a bank holiday in the UK in honor of the coronation, and after a weekend of outdoor coronation events, Internet traffic was buzzing, noticeably higher than usual.</p><p>In the past, we’ve seen Internet traffic drop when a national televised event is happening — last year, we saw it, including in the UK, during the <a href=\"/eurovision-2022-internet-trends/\">Eurovision</a>, although traffic does increase when results are in. Different types of events and broadcasts yield different Internet patterns.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2QPfTB01F1bJqr3pLXhEkW/fd9258364b15418222a7528488d82c4d/Screenshot-2023-05-10-at-18.19.47.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1612\" height=\"586\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"coronation-day-a-rollercoaster-of-internet-traffic\">Coronation day: a rollercoaster of Internet traffic</h2>\n      <a href=\"#coronation-day-a-rollercoaster-of-internet-traffic\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Let&#39;s take a closer look at coronation day, May 6, 2023, when Internet traffic in the UK had its own peaks and valleys.

The lineup included musical guests such as Take That, Lionel Richie, Katy Perry, and Andrea Bocelli. However, the star of the event, at least in terms of when Internet traffic was at its lowest that evening, was William, Prince of Wales. Cloudflare observed another significant drop in traffic, compared to the previous week, around 21:15-21:30, when traffic was 7% lower than the previous week. At that time, Lionel Richie had just performed, and Prince William was on stage for a special address to the king.</p><p>In terms of daily traffic, if on Coronation Saturday we saw an increase (4%), on Coronation Sunday there was a 6% drop compared to the previous week. On Monday, the coronation bank holiday, there weren&#39;t any major coronation events, and traffic was 4% higher than the previous week (May 1, also a bank holiday in the UK).</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"coronation-a-mobile-devices-day\">Coronation, a mobile devices day</h2>\n      <a href=\"#coronation-a-mobile-devices-day\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Zooming in on the distribution of traffic from mobile devices, we find that Saturday, May 6, stands out in 2023.

Almost 70 years ago, Queen Elizabeth II&#39;s coronation was the first ever to be televised, at a time when television in the UK was less than 20 years old. The event, which took place at Westminster Abbey in London (the site of coronations since 1066), was <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/50-facts-about-queens-coronation-0\">watched</a> by 27 million people in the UK alone and millions more around the world.</p><p>This time around, King Charles III&#39;s coronation could be viewed through that now old medium called television, or online, via streaming services. The Internet is much younger than Britain’s former monarch&#39;s reign or even Sir <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Tim Berners-Lee</a> (born in 1955), and it was only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">30 years ago</a> that the World Wide Web protocol and code were made available royalty-free, enabling the web&#39;s widespread use.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media\">Streaming media</a> events online, on the other hand, at least on a large scale, are a more recent development — YouTube was launched in 2005. Looking at video platforms trends in the UK, we could see how DNS traffic was 13% higher at around 12:00, during the coronation ceremony, on May 6 — it was broadcast on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8HVnAXZI1I\">YouTube</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5KWSZe0G9eqeznORh2nVPC/cea7bdc9065f055ae8684ed97b80c240/download--11-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"412\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>British broadcasters, such as the BBC, also included a streaming version of the event.
