Or partition data by customer ID, merchant ID, or locale within a structured data format like JSON?</p><p>Well, we want to help solve this problem too, and so we’re announcing Pipelines, an upcoming streaming ingestion service designed to ingest data at scale, aggregate it, and write it directly to R2, without you having to manage infrastructure, partitions, runners, or worry about durability.</p><p>With Pipelines, creating a globally scalable ingestion endpoint that can ingest tens-of-thousands of events per second doesn’t require any code:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">$ wrangler pipelines create clickstream-ingest-prod --batch-size=&quot;1MB&quot; --batch-timeout-secs=120 --batch-on-json-key=&quot;.merchantId&quot; --destination-bucket=&quot;prod-cs-data&quot;\n\n✅ Successfully created new pipeline &quot;clickstream-ingest-prod&quot;\n📥 Created endpoints:\n➡ HTTPS: https://d458dbe698b8eef41837f941d73bc5b3.pipelines.cloudflarestorage.com/clickstream-ingest-prod\n➡ WebSocket: wss://d458dbe698b8eef41837f941d73bc5b3.pipelines.cloudflarestorage.com:8443/clickstream-ingest-prod\n➡ Kafka: d458dbe698b8eef41837f941d73bc5b3.pipelines.cloudflarestorage.com:9092 (topic: clickstream-ingest-prod)</pre></code>\n            <p>As you can see here, we’re already thinking about how to make Pipelines protocol-agnostic: write from a HTTP client, stream events over a WebSocket, and/or redirect your existing Kafka producer (and stop having to manage and scale Kafka) directly to Pipelines.</p><p>But that’s just the beginning of our vision here. Scalable ingestion and simple batching is one thing, but what about if you have more complex needs?

The ability to durably execute an application, modeled as a series of steps, applies to a wide number of domains. You can apply this model of execution to a number of use-cases, including:</p><ul><li><p>Deploying software: each step can define a build step and subsequent health check, gating further progress until your deployment meets your criteria for “healthy”.</p></li><li><p>Post-processing user data: triggering a workflow based on user uploads (e.g. to Cloudflare R2) that then subsequently parses that data asynchronously, redacts PII or sensitive data, writes the sanitized output, and triggers a notification via email, webhook, or mobile push.</p></li><li><p>Payment and batch workflows: aggregating raw customer usage data on a periodic schedule by querying your data warehouse (or <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/\">Workers Analytics Engine</a>), triggering usage or spend alerts, and/or generating PDF invoices.</p></li></ul><p>Each of these use cases model tasks that you want to run to completion, minimize redundant retries by persisting intermediate state, and (importantly) easily observe success and failure.</p><p><b>We’ll be sharing more about Workflows during the second quarter of 2024 as we work towards an open (public!) beta</b>. This includes how we’re thinking about idempotency and interactions with our storage, per-instance observability and metrics, local development, and templates to bootstrap common workflows.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"putting-it-together\">Putting it together</h3>\n      <a href=\"#putting-it-together\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We’ve often thought of Cloudflare’s own network as one massively scalable parallel data processing cluster: <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">data centers in 310+ cities</a>, with the ability to run compute close to users and/or <a href=\"https://smart-placement-demo.pages.dev/\">close to data</a>, keep it within the bounds of regulatory or compliance requirements, and most importantly, use our massive scale to enable our customers to scale as well.</p><p>Recapping, a fully-fledged data platform needs to enable three things:</p><ol><li><p>Ingesting data: getting data into the platform (in the right format, from the right sources)</p></li><li><p>Storing data: securely, reliably, and durably.</p></li><li><p>Querying data: understanding and extracting insights from the data, and/or transforming it for use by other tools.</p></li></ol><p>When we launched R2 we tackled the second part, but knew that we’d need to follow up with the first and third parts in order to make it easier for developers to get data in and make use of it.</p><p>If we look at how we can build a system that helps us solve each of these three parts together with Pipelines, Event Notifications, R2, and Workflows, we end up with an architecture that resembles this:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/15ue6XZBrDyTtfja0z8VS5/57140a77d3881b3b3c8c5a0186c2a84f/image1-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1020\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Specifically, we have Pipelines (1) scaling out to ingest data, batch it, filter it, and then durably store it in R2 (2) in a format that’s ready and optimized for querying. Workflows, ClickHouse, Databricks, or the query engine of your choice can then query (3) that data as soon as it’s ready — with “ready” being automatically triggered by an Event Notification <i>as soon as the data is ingested and written to R2</i>.</p><p>There’s no need to poll, no need to batch after the fact, no need to have your query engine slow down on data that wasn’t pre-aggregated or filtered, and no need to manage and scale infrastructure in order to keep up with load or data jurisdiction requirements. Create a Pipeline, write your data directly to R2, and query directly from it.</p><p>If you’re also looking at this and wondering about the costs of moving this data around, then we’re holding to one important principle: <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/the-net/cloud-egress-fees-challenge-future-ai/\">zero egress fees</a> across all of our data products. Just as we set the stage for this with <a href=\"/introducing-r2-object-storage\">our R2 object storage</a>, we intend to apply this to every data product we’re building, Pipelines included.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"start-building\">Start Building</h3>\n      <a href=\"#start-building\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We’ve shared a lot of what we’re building so that developers have an opportunity to provide feedback (including via our <a href=\"https://discord.cloudflare.com/\">Developer Discord</a>), share use-cases, and think about how to build their <i>next</i> application on Cloudflare.</p>",
