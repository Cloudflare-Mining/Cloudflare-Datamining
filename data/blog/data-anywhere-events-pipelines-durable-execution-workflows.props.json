That could be processing user-driven uploads, updating search indexes as the underlying data changes, or removing associated rows in your SQL database when content is removed.</p><p>In order to make these event-driven workflows far easier to build across Cloudflare, we’re launching the first step towards a wider Event Notifications platform across Cloudflare, starting with notifications support in R2.</p><p>You can read more in the deep-dive on <a href=\"/r2-events-gcs-migration-infrequent-access/\">Event Notifications for R2</a>, but in a nutshell: you can configure changes to content in any R2 bucket to write directly to a <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/\">Queue</a>, allowing you to reliably consume those events in a Worker or to <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/reference/pull-consumers/\">pull from compute</a> in a legacy cloud.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/63wR0NuQIFaZUo5TvDvS29/92999ffd89864a36a832e0341852fc06/image2-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1020\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Event Notifications for R2 are just the beginning, though.

As you start to consume events, you may want to trigger multi-step <i>workflows</i> that execute reliably, resume from errors or exceptions, and ensure that previous steps aren’t duplicated or repeated unnecessarily. An event notification framework turns out to be just the thing needed to drive <a href=\"#durable-exectution\">a workflow engine that <i>executes durably</i>…</a></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"making-it-even-easier-to-ingest-data\">Making it even easier to ingest data</h3>\n            <a href=\"#making-it-even-easier-to-ingest-data\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>When we launched <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/\">Cloudflare R2</a>, our object storage service, we knew that supporting the de facto-standard <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/api/\">S3 API</a> was critical in order to allow developers to bring the tooling and services they already had over to R2.

The ability to durably execute an application, modeled as a series of steps, applies to a wide number of domains. You can apply this model of execution to a number of use-cases, including:</p><ul><li><p>Deploying software: each step can define a build step and subsequent health check, gating further progress until your deployment meets your criteria for “healthy”.</p></li><li><p>Post-processing user data: triggering a workflow based on user uploads (e.g. to Cloudflare R2) that then subsequently parses that data asynchronously, redacts PII or sensitive data, writes the sanitized output, and triggers a notification via email, webhook, or mobile push.</p></li><li><p>Payment and batch workflows: aggregating raw customer usage data on a periodic schedule by querying your data warehouse (or <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/\">Workers Analytics Engine</a>), triggering usage or spend alerts, and/or generating PDF invoices.</p></li></ul><p>Each of these use cases model tasks that you want to run to completion, minimize redundant retries by persisting intermediate state, and (importantly) easily observe success and failure.</p><p><b>We’ll be sharing more about Workflows during the second quarter of 2024 as we work towards an open (public!) beta</b>. This includes how we’re thinking about idempotency and interactions with our storage, per-instance observability and metrics, local development, and templates to bootstrap common workflows.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"putting-it-together\">Putting it together</h3>\n            <a href=\"#putting-it-together\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>We’ve often thought of Cloudflare’s own network as one massively scalable parallel data processing cluster: <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">data centers in 310+ cities</a>, with the ability to run compute close to users and/or <a href=\"https://smart-placement-demo.pages.dev/\">close to data</a>, keep it within the bounds of regulatory or compliance requirements, and most importantly, use our massive scale to enable our customers to scale as well.</p><p>Recapping, a fully-fledged data platform needs to enable three things:</p><ol><li><p>Ingesting data: getting data into the platform (in the right format, from the right sources)</p></li><li><p>Storing data: securely, reliably, and durably.</p></li><li><p>Querying data: understanding and extracting insights from the data, and/or transforming it for use by other tools.</p></li></ol><p>When we launched R2 we tackled the second part, but knew that we’d need to follow up with the first and third parts in order to make it easier for developers to get data in and make use of it.</p><p>If we look at how we can build a system that helps us solve each of these three parts together with Pipelines, Event Notifications, R2, and Workflows, we end up with an architecture that resembles this:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/15ue6XZBrDyTtfja0z8VS5/baedf1a168731a319a6b14eb14f3ad00/image1-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1020\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Specifically, we have Pipelines (1) scaling out to ingest data, batch it, filter it, and then durably store it in R2 (2) in a format that’s ready and optimized for querying. Workflows, ClickHouse, Databricks, or the query engine of your choice can then query (3) that data as soon as it’s ready — with “ready” being automatically triggered by an Event Notification <i>as soon as the data is ingested and written to R2</i>.</p><p>There’s no need to poll, no need to batch after the fact, no need to have your query engine slow down on data that wasn’t pre-aggregated or filtered, and no need to manage and scale infrastructure in order to keep up with load or data jurisdiction requirements. Create a Pipeline, write your data directly to R2, and query directly from it.</p><p>If you’re also looking at this and wondering about the costs of moving this data around, then we’re holding to one important principle: zero egress fees across all of our data products. Just as we set the stage for this with <a href=\"/introducing-r2-object-storage\">our R2 object storage</a>, we intend to apply this to every data product we’re building, Pipelines included.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"start-building\">Start Building</h3>\n            <a href=\"#start-building\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>We’ve shared a lot of what we’re building so that developers have an opportunity to provide feedback (including via our <a href=\"https://discord.cloudflare.com/\">Developer Discord</a>), share use-cases, and think about how to build their <i>next</i> application on Cloudflare.</p>",
