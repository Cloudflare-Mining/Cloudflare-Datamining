In the global event we got to see several Oscars attributed to winners like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_Academy_Awards\">CODA, Jane Campion</a> (the director of The Power of the Dog) and also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_Academy_Awards\">Dune</a> (which won six Oscars), but also moments that had a clear impact in the Internet traffic, like the altercation on stage between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_Academy_Awards#Will_Smith_and_Chris_Rock_altercation\">Will Smith and Chris Rock</a>.</p><p>Cloudflare Radar uses a variety of sources to provide aggregate information about Internet traffic and attack trends. In this blog post, we will use DNS name resolution data as a proxy for traffic to Internet services, as we did for <a href=\"/who-won-super-bowl-lvi-a-look-at-internet-traffic-during-the-big-game/\">the Super Bowl LVI</a>.</p><p>The baseline value for the charts (that are only focused on the US) was calculated by taking the mean DNS traffic level for the associated Internet services between 08:00 - 12:00 PST on Sunday (March 27, 2022) — usually we use UTC, but we chose to use Los Angeles time as that’s where the event took place.</p><p>The event started with Beyoncé singing at 17:00 PST and ended at around 20:30. In terms of growth in traffic, the start of the show didn’t show much for social media, although TikTok and Twitter started to decrease in DNS requests after that time.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"will-smith-makes-twitter-and-tiktok-rise-in-requests\">Will Smith makes Twitter and TikTok rise in requests</h3>\n      <a href=\"#will-smith-makes-twitter-and-tiktok-rise-in-requests\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Twitter and TikTok were the social networks that seemed most impacted by the moment Will Smith went on stage and started an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_Academy_Awards#Will_Smith_and_Chris_Rock_altercation\">altercation with Chris Rock</a> after a joke.</p><p>For <b>Twitter</b>, the major change in DNS requests was exactly after that incident (at 19:25); before that, at 18:00, the moment Sebastián Yatra performed Encanto’s Dos Oruguitas song also had a small spike.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2y3qdX5d3Q8w0CHxQ83JqB/e2bb02fb8994002f3af8960389702b51/image2-95.png\" alt=\"Chart of Twitter DNS traffic growth with a spike when the Will Smith incident occurred.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"738\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>There were 32% more DNS requests for Twitter a few minutes after the altercation, and that growth peaked at 20:15 with 51% more requests than there were at 19:20 — that was after Will Smith (20:05) gave his acceptance and apology speech, when he was awarded the Best Actor Oscar.
