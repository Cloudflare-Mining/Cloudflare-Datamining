In the global event we got to see several Oscars attributed to winners like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_Academy_Awards\">CODA, Jane Campion</a> (the director of The Power of the Dog) and also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_Academy_Awards\">Dune</a> (which won six Oscars), but also moments that had a clear impact in the Internet traffic, like the altercation on stage between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_Academy_Awards#Will_Smith_and_Chris_Rock_altercation\">Will Smith and Chris Rock</a>.</p><p>Cloudflare Radar uses a variety of sources to provide aggregate information about Internet traffic and attack trends.

In terms of growth in traffic, the start of the show didn’t show much for social media, although TikTok and Twitter started to decrease in DNS requests after that time.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"will-smith-makes-twitter-and-tiktok-rise-in-requests\">Will Smith makes Twitter and TikTok rise in requests</h3>\n            <a href=\"#will-smith-makes-twitter-and-tiktok-rise-in-requests\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Twitter and TikTok were the social networks that seemed most impacted by the moment Will Smith went on stage and started an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_Academy_Awards#Will_Smith_and_Chris_Rock_altercation\">altercation with Chris Rock</a> after a joke.</p><p>For <b>Twitter</b>, the major change in DNS requests was exactly after that incident (at 19:25); before that, at 18:00, the moment Sebastián Yatra performed Encanto’s Dos Oruguitas song also had a small spike.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2y3qdX5d3Q8w0CHxQ83JqB/a52ad0bf9c49fba4feecba79e53b0189/image2-95.png\" alt=\"Chart of Twitter DNS traffic growth with a spike when the Will Smith incident occurred.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"738\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>There were 32% more DNS requests for Twitter a few minutes after the altercation, and that growth peaked at 20:15 with 51% more requests than there were at 19:20 — that was after Will Smith (20:05) gave his acceptance and apology speech, when he was awarded the Best Actor Oscar.
