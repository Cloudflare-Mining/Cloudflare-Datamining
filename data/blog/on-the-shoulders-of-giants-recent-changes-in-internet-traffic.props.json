And it&#39;s a vital motor of the global economy as many companies have employees who are now working from home.</p><p>Traffic towards video conferencing, streaming services and news, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/\">e-commerce</a> websites has surged. We&#39;ve seen growth in traffic from residential broadband networks, and a slowing of traffic from businesses and universities.</p><p>The Cloudflare team is fully operational and the Network Operating Center (NOC) is watching the changing traffic patterns in the more than 200 cities in which we operate hardware.</p><p>Big changes in Internet traffic aren&#39;t unusual. They often occur around large sporting events like the Olympics or World Cup, cultural events like the Eurovision Song Contest and even during Ramadan at the breaking of the fast each day.</p><p>The Internet was built to cope with an ever changing environment. In fact, it was literally created, tested, debugged and designed to deal with changing load patterns.</p><p>Over the last few weeks, the Cloudflare Network team has noticed some new patterns and we wanted to share a few of them with you.</p><h3>Entire countries are watching their leaders</h3><p>Last Friday evening, the US President announced a State of Emergency in the United States. Not so long after, our US data centers served 20% more traffic than usual. The red line shows Friday, the grey lines the preceding days for comparison.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3cgutP0x9kF0enY9jPw64F/5f3afd60a081996b91b227bcb0f20edb/image1-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1984\" height=\"910\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>On the Sunday, March 15, the Dutch government announced on the radio at 1730 local time closures of the non-essential business (1630 UTC).
