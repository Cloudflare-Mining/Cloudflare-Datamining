Here we take a look at the run-off election this Sunday, April 24, that ended up re-electing Emmanuel Macron as President of France.</p><p>First, the two main trends: French-language news sites outside France were clearly impacted by the local rule that states that exit polls can only be published after 20:00.</p><p>And Internet traffic was similar on both the election days (April 10 and 24) and that includes the increase in use of mobile devices and interest in news websites — there we also saw a clear interest in the Macron-Le Pen debate on April 20.</p><p>We have discussed before that <a href=\"/elections-france-2022/\">election days</a> usually don’t have a major impact on overall Internet traffic. Let’s compare April 10 with 24, the two Sundays when the elections were held. The trends throughout the day are incredibly similar (with a slight increase in traffic on April 24), even with a two-week gap between them.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1wVE32kL2bw5d0CYlbFycq/6931bc290fc67622144d45e013ccf455/image7-8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Another election-day trend is the use of mobile devices to access the Internet, mainly at night. The largest spikes in number of requests made using mobile devices in France during April seemed to be all election-related:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6JjaTwLAu942Sflhy42X21/9cdbb9a5ab56e9ade80e4e7368bb28ed/image1-23.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"693\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>#1. April 10 (first round of the election), 21:00 local time. 58% of traffic by mobile devices.</p><p>#2. April 24 (second round of the  election), 22:00. 57% mobile traffic.</p><p>#3. April 20 (presidential debate), 22:00. 56% mobile traffic.</p><p>Not only did both the election Sundays (after the polling stations were closed) have an impact on mobile traffic in France, but the presidential debate (Wednesday, April 20) had the same type of impact, increasing requests from mobile devices.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61166601\">TV debate</a> was seen by 15.6 million viewers in France and lasted between 21:00 and 22:45, local time; at the same time mobile traffic was higher than in any other Wednesday and was the #3 spike of April, with 10% more mobile requests than in the previous Wednesday at the same time.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"the-special-case-of-french-language-news-sites\">The special case of French-language news sites</h4>\n      <a href=\"#the-special-case-of-french-language-news-sites\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>For the elections, <a href=\"https://www.cnccep.fr/pdf-cp8.html\">local rules state</a> that French media is barred from publishing partial results or polls of any kind until 20:00, the time when voting stations in metropolitan France officially close. So, that means that French news outlets have to wait for the allotted hour to give official <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220424-not-just-exit-polls-why-french-election-projections-are-almost-always-correct\">projections</a>.</p><p>Given that, we looked at French-language news websites from French-speaking countries like Switzerland and Belgium. They aren’t bound by French law and can show information about exit polls earlier (bear in mind that in most French cities polling stations close at 19:00 and only in the bigger cities does it go on until 20:00).</p><p>For example, the Swiss Le Temps <a href=\"https://www.letemps.ch/monde/resultats-presidentielle-francaise-emmanuel-macron-reelu-plus-58-voix\">published exit polls</a> at 19:30.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1AbV8Dw1cwkzHM5lcQYtoD/00c62c3358534d410fc5ecf564ab0235/french.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We can clearly see that requests to French-language news sites outside France clearly spiked earlier than those in France. News websites in France had spikes after 20:00 local time on both elections days, but Belgian and Swiss news sites had major increases in traffic at 19:00 on April 10 (1857% more than the previous Sunday!). For the runoff elections on April 24, the biggest spike of the month was at 18:00 (3100% more requests than the previous Sunday), but it was also higher than on previous days one hour later, at 19:00 (3080% higher).</p><p>There are no spikes at all related to the French debate (April 20), so that seems to show that those Belgian and Swiss news sites had a huge increase of French citizens eager to see the polls before 20:00.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"election-results-change-online-patterns\"><b>Election results change online patterns</b></h3>\n      <a href=\"#election-results-change-online-patterns\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><a href=\"/elections-france-2022/\">We saw two weeks ago</a> that official election websites had a clear spike in requests on April 10, the first round of the elections.
