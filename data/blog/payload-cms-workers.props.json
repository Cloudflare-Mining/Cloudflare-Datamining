This seemingly basic piece of software is used to draft and publish blog posts, organize media assets, manage user profiles, and perform countless other tasks across a dizzying array of use cases. One standout in this category is a vibrant open-source project called Payload, which has over 35,000 stars on <a href=\"https://github.com/payloadcms/payload\"><u>GitHub</u></a> and has generated so much community excitement that it was recently <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/payload-joins-figma/\"><u>acquired</u></a> by Figma.</p><p>Today we’re excited to showcase <a href=\"https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/with-cloudflare-d1\"><b><u>a new template</u></b></a> from the Payload team, which makes it possible to deploy a full-fledged CMS to Cloudflare’s platform in a single click: just click the <i>Deploy to Cloudflare</i> button to generate a fully-configured Payload instance, complete with bindings to Cloudflare D1 and R2.

That means you need to provision hardware or virtual machines, install the CMS software and dependencies, manage ports and firewalls, and navigate ongoing maintenance and scaling hurdles.</p><p>This presents significant operational overhead, and can be costly if your server needs to handle high volumes (or spiky peaks) of traffic. What’s worse, you’re paying for that server whether you have any active users or not. One of the superpowers of Cloudflare Workers is that your application and data are accessible 24/7, without needing a server running all the time. When people use your application, it spins up at the closest Cloudflare server, ready to go. When your users are asleep, the Worker spins down, and you don’t pay for compute you aren’t using. </p><p>With Payload running on Workers, you get the best of conventional CMSs — fully configurable asset management, custom webhooks, a library of community plugins, version history — all in a serverless form factor. We’ve been piloting the Payload-on-Workers template with an instance of our 24/7 video platform Cloudflare TV, which we use as a test bed for new technologies. Migrating from a conventional CMS was painless, thanks to its support for common features like conditional logic and an extensive set of components for building out our admin dashboard. Our content library has over 2,000 episodes and 70,000 assets, and Payload’s <a href=\"https://payloadcms.com/docs/queries/overview\"><u>filtering and search</u></a> features help us navigate them with ease.</p><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 65.16587677725119%;\">\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https://customer-eq7kiuol0tk9chox.cloudflarestream.com/5ac9ba174903f80c3d9dd7e52dc40c67/iframe?preload=true&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fcustomer-eq7kiuol0tk9chox.cloudflarestream.com%2F5ac9ba174903f80c3d9dd7e52dc40c67%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D%26height%3D600\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\"\n    allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n  ></iframe>\n</div><p>It is worth reiterating just how many use cases CMSs can fulfill, from publishing to ecommerce to bespoke application dashboards whipped up by Claude Code or Codex.

Because we wanted the application to run seamlessly on Workers, with all the benefits of <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/\"><u>Workers Bindings</u></a>, we set out to ensure support for Cloudflare’s database and storage products.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"database\">Database</h3>\n      <a href=\"#database\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>For our initial approach, we began by connecting Payload to an external Postgres database, using the official <code>@payloadcms/db-postgres </code>adapter. Thanks to Workers support for the <code>node-postgres</code> package, everything worked pretty much straight away. As connections <a href=\"https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare/troubleshooting#error-cannot-perform-io-on-behalf-of-a-different-request\"><u>cannot be shared</u></a> across requests, we just had to disable connection pooling:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-TypeScript\"><code class=\"language-TypeScript\">import { buildConfig } from &#039;payload&#039;\nimport { postgresAdapter } from &#039;@payloadcms/db-postgres&#039;\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  …\n  db: postgresAdapter({\n    pool: {\n      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URI,\n      max: 1,\n      min: 0,\n      idleTimeoutMillis: 1,\n    },\n  }),\n  …\n});</pre></code>\n            <p>Of course, disabling connection pooling increases the overall latency, as each request needs to first establish a new connection with the database. To address this, we put <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/\"><u>Hyperdrive</u></a> in front of it, which not only maintains a pool of connections across the Cloudflare network, by setting up a tunnel to the database server, but also adds a query cache, significantly improving the performance.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-TypeScript\"><code class=\"language-TypeScript\">import { buildConfig } from &#039;payload&#039;\nimport { postgresAdapter } from &#039;@payloadcms/db-postgres&#039;\nimport { getCloudflareContext } from &#039;@opennextjs/cloudflare&#039;;\n\nconst cloudflare = await getCloudflareContext({ async: true });\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  …\n  db: postgresAdapter({\n    pool: {\n      connectionString: cloudflare.env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,\n      max: 1,\n      min: 0,\n      idleTimeoutMillis: 1,\n    },\n  }),\n  …\n});</pre></code>\n            \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"database-with-d1\">Database with D1</h3>\n      <a href=\"#database-with-d1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>With Postgres working, we next sought to add support for <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/\"><u>D1</u></a>, Cloudflare’s managed serverless database, built on top of SQLite.</p><p>Payload doesn’t support D1 out of the box, but has support for SQLite via the <code>@payloadcms/db-sqlite</code> adapter, which uses <a href=\"https://orm.drizzle.team/\"><u>Drizzle ORM</u></a> alongside libSQL. Thankfully, Drizzle also has support for D1, so we decided to build a custom adapter for D1, using the SQLite one as a base.</p><p>The main difference between D1 and libSQL is on the result object, so we built a small method to map the result from D1 into the format expected by libSQL:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-TypeScript\"><code class=\"language-TypeScript\">export const execute: Execute&lt;any&gt; = function execute({ db, drizzle, raw, sql: statement }) {\n  const executeFrom = (db ?? drizzle)!\n  const mapToLibSql = (query: SQLiteRaw&lt;D1Result&lt;unknown&gt;&gt;) =&gt; {\n    const execute = query.execute\n    query.execute = async () =&gt; {\n      const result: D1Result = await execute()\n      const resultLibSQL: Omit&lt;ResultSet, &#039;toJSON&#039;&gt; = {\n        columns: undefined,\n        columnTypes: undefined,\n        lastInsertRowid: BigInt(result.meta.last_row_id),\n        rows: result.results as any[],\n        rowsAffected: result.meta.rows_written,\n      }\n\n      return Object.assign(result, resultLibSQL)\n    }\n\n    return query\n  }\n\n  if (raw) {\n    const result = mapToLibSql(executeFrom.run(sql.raw(raw)))\n    return result\n  } else {\n    const result = mapToLibSql(executeFrom.run(statement!))\n    return result\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>Other than that, it was just a matter of <a href=\"https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/connect-cloudflare-d1\"><u>passing the D1 binding</u></a> directly into Drizzle’s constructor in order to get it working.</p><p>For applying database migrations during deployment, we used the newly released<a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-09-16-remote-bindings-ga/\"> <u>remote bindings</u></a> feature of Wrangler to connect to the remote database, using the same binding.

As Payload is deployed as a Worker, requests may be coming from any part of the world and so latency will be all over the place when connecting to the database.</p><p>To solve this, we can make use of D1’s <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/best-practices/read-replication/\"><u>global read replication</u></a>, which deploys multiple read-only replicas across the globe. To select the correct replica and ensure sequential consistency, D1 uses sessions, with a bookmark that needs to be passed around.</p><p>Drizzle <a href=\"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/2226\"><u>doesn’t support D1 sessions</u></a> yet, but we can still use the “first-primary” type of session, in which the first query will always hit the primary instance and subsequent queries may hit one of the replicas. Updating the adapter to use replicas is just a matter of updating the Drizzle initialization to pass the D1 session directly:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-TypeScript\"><code class=\"language-TypeScript\">this.drizzle = drizzle(this.binding.withSession(&quot;first-primary&quot;), \n{ logger, schema: this.schema });</pre></code>\n            <p>After this simple change, we saw immediate latency improvements, with the P50 wall-time for requests from across the globe reduced by 60% when connecting to a database located in Eastern North America. Read replicas, as the name implies, only affect read-only queries, so any write operations will always be forwarded to the primary instance, but for our use case, reads are most of the traffic.</p><table><tr><td><p>\n</p></td><td><p>No read replicas</p></td><td><p>Read replicas enabled</p></td><td><p>Improvement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>P50</p></td><td><p>300ms</p></td><td><p>120ms</p></td><td><p>-60%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>P90</p></td><td><p>480ms</p></td><td><p>250ms</p></td><td><p>-48%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>P99</p></td><td><p>760ms</p></td><td><p>550ms</p></td><td><p>-28%</p></td></tr></table><p><sup><i>Wall time for requests to the Payload worker, each involving two database calls, as reported by Cloudflare Dash.
