We would not have believed it, either. The office has been a cornerstone of work in the modern era — almost an unshakeable assumption.</p><p>That assumption carried over into the way we built out IT systems, too. They were almost all predicated on us working from a consistent place.</p><p>And yet, here we are. Trends that had started out as a trickle — employees out of the office, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/remote-workforces/\">remote work</a>, BYOD — were transformed into a tsunami, almost overnight. Employees are anywhere, using any mobile or desktop device available to work, including personal devices. Applications exist across data centers, public clouds and SaaS hosting providers. Tasks increasingly are completed in a browser. All of this increases load on corporate networks.</p><p>While how we work has changed, the corporate networks and security models to enable this work have struggled to keep pace. They still often rely on a corporate perimeter that allows lateral network movement once a user or device is present on the network. VPNs remain a choke point in this model, tunneling their user traffic back into corporate perimeter where people rarely work; and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mpls/\">MPLS lines</a> and other private networking tools are still being used to extend an organization’s perimeter to… other offices, where people also rarely work.</p><p>And it’s not just that all these are expensive to set up: VPNs, MPLS lines and other perimeter solutions come with performance loss, create maintenance burden, and lack modern security tooling. Attackers know how to exploit their weaknesses. Many well known attacks over the last few years can be traced to unauthorized network access and subsequent lateral movement.</p><p>These problems are well known. Surprisingly, the answer to those challenges is also widely agreed upon at this point: shift to a Zero Trust Architecture. So what’s stopping people? As we’ve spoken to folks, it’s one thing, more than anything else: how? How do we do this? Underlying this is worry — that yes, while there are plenty of the risks and problems associated with the old world, they’d rather tackle the devil they know than the one that they don’t — the worry and change and cost associated with the lifting and shifting to Zero Trust.</p><p>This, more than anything else, is what we want to change with Cloudflare One Week.</p><p>Zero Trust doesn’t need to be hard. It can be stage-gated. You prove the benefits of the new model to your organization, while allowing it to transition at a pace it can handle. In short: Zero Trust can let your organization do more, let your organization do it better, and all this can come with cost savings.</p><p>Welcome to Cloudflare One Week.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-shifting-goalposts-of-zero-trust-sase-sse\">The shifting goalposts of Zero Trust, SASE, SSE</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-shifting-goalposts-of-zero-trust-sase-sse\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>While there is broad recognition of the limits of the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-the-network-perimeter/\">perimeter model</a>, one thing that keeps coming up in customer conversations about Zero Trust is: how do all these replacement concepts relate to one another?

All these terms get thrown around, sometimes interchangeably. We’ve spent the time understanding and building out the products to get a comprehensive Zero Trust solution.</p><p>But we don’t want you to just trust us.</p><p>We believe in Zero Trust Architecture so strongly that we worked with security experts to build a <a href=\"https://zerotrustroadmap.org/\">vendor-agnostic guide</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/how-to-implement-zero-trust/\">implementing Zero Trust</a>.

The network spans 270+ cities, 100 countries and is within 50ms of 95% of the Internet connected global population.
