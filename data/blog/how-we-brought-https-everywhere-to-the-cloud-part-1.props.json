Instead of re-writing URLs in the browser, we would re-write them inside the CloudFlare reverse proxy. By taking advantage of the existing database on the server-side, website owners could turn it on and all their users would instantly benefit from HTTPS rewriting. The fact that itâ€™s automatic is especially useful for websites with user-generated content where it&#39;s not trivial to find and fix all the cases of inserted insecure third-party content.</p><p>At our scale, we obviously couldn&#39;t use the existing JavaScript rewriter. The performance challenges for a browser extension which can find, match and cache rules lazily as a user opens websites, are very different from those of a CDN server that handles millions of requests per second. We usually don&#39;t get a chance to rewrite them before they hit the cache either, as many pages are dynamically generated on the origin server and go straight through us to the client.</p><p>That means, to take advantage of the database, we needed to learn how the existing implementation works and create our own in the form of a native library that could work without delays under our load. Let&#39;s do the same here.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"how-does-https-everywhere-know-what-to-rewrite\">How does HTTPS Everywhere know what to rewrite?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#how-does-https-everywhere-know-what-to-rewrite\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>HTTPS Everywhere rulesets can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere/tree/master/src/chrome/content/rules\"><code>src/chrome/content/rules</code></a> folder of the <a href=\"https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere\">official repository</a>. They are organized as XML files, each for their own set of hosts (with few exclusions). This allows users with basic technical skills to write and contribute missing rules to the database on their own.</p><p>Each ruleset is an XML file of the following structure:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-xml\"><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;ruleset name=&quot;example.org&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Target domains --&gt;\n  &lt;target host=&quot;*.example.org&quot; /&gt;\n \n  &lt;!-- Exclusions --&gt;\n  &lt;exclusion pattern=&quot;^http://example\\.org/i-am-http-only&quot; /&gt;\n \n  &lt;!-- Rewrite rules --&gt;\n  &lt;rule from=&quot;^http://(www\\.)?example\\.org/&quot; to=&quot;https://$1example.org/&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/ruleset&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>At the moment of writing, the HTTPS Everywhere database consists of ~22K such rulesets covering ~113K domain wildcards with ~32K rewrite rules and exclusions.</p><p>For performance reasons, we can&#39;t keep all those ruleset XMLs in memory, go through nodes, check each wildcard, perform replacements based on specific string format and so on. All that work would introduce significant delays in page processing and increase memory consumption on our servers. That&#39;s why we had to perform some compile-time tricks for each type of node to ensure that rewriting is smooth and fast for any user from the very first request.</p><p>Let&#39;s walk through those nodes and see what can be done in each specific case.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"target-domains\">Target domains</h3>\n            <a href=\"#target-domains\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>First of all, we get target elements which describe domain wildcards that current ruleset potentially covers.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-xml\"><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;target host=&quot;*.example.org&quot; /&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>If a wildcard is used, it can be <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/rulesets#wildcard-targets\">either left-side or right-side</a>.</p><p>Left-side wildcard like <code>*.example.org</code> covers any hostname which has example.org as a suffix - no matter how many subdomain levels you have.</p><p>Right-side wildcard like <code>example.*</code> covers only one level instead so that subdomains with the same beginning but one unexpected domain level are not accidentally caught. For example, the Google ruleset, among others, uses the <code>google.*</code> wildcard and it should match <code>google.com</code>, <code>google.ru</code>, <code>google.es</code> etc. but not <code>google.mywebsite.com</code>.</p><p>Note that a single host can be covered by several different rulesets as wildcards can overlap, so the rewriter should be given entire database in order to find a correct replacement. Still, matching hostname allows to instantly reduce all ~22,000 rulesets to only 3-5 which we can deal with more easily.</p><p>Matching wildcards at runtime one-by-one is, of course, possible, but very inefficient with ~113K domain wildcards (and, as we noted above, one domain can match several rulesets, so we can&#39;t even bail out early).

Ragel is a state machine compiler which takes grammars and actions described with its own syntax and generates source code in a given programming language as an output. We decided to use it here too and wrote a script that generates a Ragel grammar from our set of wildcards. In turn, Ragel converts it into C code of a state machine capable of going through characters of URLs, matching hosts and invoking custom handler on each found ruleset.</p><p>This leads us to another interesting problem. At the moment of writing among 113K domain wildcards we have 4.7K that have a left wildcard and less than 200 which have a right wildcard. Left wildcards are expensive in state machines (including regular expressions) as they cause <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion\">DFA space explosion</a> during compilation so Ragel got stuck for more than 10 minutes without giving any result - trying to analyze all the <code>*.</code> prefixes and merge all the possible states where they can go, resulting in a complex tree.</p><p>Instead, if we choose to look from the end of the host, we can significantly simplify the state tree (as only 200 wildcards need to be checked separately now instead of 4.7K), thus reducing compile time to less than 20 seconds.</p><p>Let&#39;s take an oversimplified example to understand the difference. Say, we have following target wildcards (3 left-wildcards against 1 right-wildcard and 1 simple host):</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-xml\"><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;target host=&quot;*.google.com&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;target host=&quot;*.google.co.uk&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;target host=&quot;*.google.es&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;target host=&quot;google.*&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;target host=&quot;google.com&quot; /&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>If we build Ragel state machine directly from those:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">%%{\n    machine hosts;\n \n    host_part = (alnum | [_\\-])+;\n \n    main := (\n        any+ &#039;.google.com&#039; |\n        any+ &#039;.google.co.uk&#039; |\n        any+ &#039;.google.es&#039; |\n        &#039;google.&#039; host_part |\n        &#039;google.com.ua&#039;\n    );\n}%%</pre></code>\n            <p>We will get the following state graph:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=/content/images/2016/09/1.png>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1sykJ6ByovKV68tzpCF5zn/7fe8636ec9e22c152e6e8e83e007509a/1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"5427\" height=\"2220\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>You can see that the graph is already pretty complex as each starting character, even <code>g</code> which is an explicit starting character of <code>&#39;google.&#39;</code> and <code>&#39;google.com&#39;</code> strings, still needs to simultaneously go also into <code>any+</code> matches. Even when you have already parsed the <code>google.</code> part of the host name, it can still correctly match any of the given wildcards whether as <code>google.google.com</code>, <code>google.google.co.uk</code>, <code>google.google.es</code>, <code>google.tech</code> or <code>google.com.ua</code>. This already blows up the complexity of the state machine, and we only took an oversimplified example with three left wildcards here.</p><p>However, if we simply reverse each rule in order to feed the string starting from the end:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">%%{\n    machine hosts;\n \n    host_part = (alnum | [_\\-])+;\n \n    main := (\n        &#039;moc.elgoog.&#039; |\n        &#039;ku.oc.elgoog.&#039; |\n        &#039;se.elgoog.&#039; |\n        host_part &#039;.elgoog&#039; |\n        &#039;au.moc.elgoog&#039;\n    );\n}%%</pre></code>\n            <p>we can get much simpler graph and, consequently, significantly reduced graph build and matching times:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=/content/images/2016/09/2.png>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6NfYuIYypMQPvlSOkk40so/e44c0007f0c2d621e5d755cb2e3ad099/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"3215\" height=\"1064\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>So now, all that we need is to do is to go through the host part in the URL, stop on <code>/</code> right after and start the machine backwards from this point. There is no need to waste time with in-memory string reversal as Ragel provides the <code>getkey</code> instruction for custom data access expressions which we can use for accessing characters in reverse order after we match the ending slash.</p><p>Here is animation of the full process:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5dcX7Zc8OH98Y9SDAIAu5E/a2cb285821563467d2ae59f365402099/third.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"756\" height=\"192\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>After we&#39;ve matched the host name and found potentially applicable rulesets, we need to ensure that we&#39;re not rewriting URLs which are not available via HTTPS.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"exclusions\">Exclusions</h3>\n            <a href=\"#exclusions\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Exclusion elements serve exactly this goal.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-xml\"><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;exclusion pattern=&quot;^http://(www\\.)?google\\.com/analytics/&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;exclusion pattern=&quot;^http://(www\\.)?google\\.com/imgres/&quot; /&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>The rewriter needs to test against all the exclusion patterns before applying any actual rules.

If a URL matches a regular expression, we bail out of this action as following rewrites shouldn&#39;t be applied. After this, Ragel will automatically call another matched action (another ruleset) on its own until one is found.</p><p>Finally, after we both matched the host name and ensured that our URL is not covered by any exclusion patterns, we can go to the actual rewrite rules.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"rewrite-rules\">Rewrite rules</h3>\n            <a href=\"#rewrite-rules\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>These rules are presented as JavaScript regular expressions and replacement patterns.

Note: while exclusions cover dangerous replacements, it&#39;s totally possible and valid for the URL to not match any of actual rules - in that case it should be just left intact.</p><p>After the previous steps we are usually reduced only to couple of rules, so unlike in the case with exclusions, we don&#39;t apply any clever merging techniques for them. It turned out to be easier to go through them one-by-one rather than create a regexp engine specifically optimized for the case of multi-regexp replacements.</p><p>However, we don&#39;t want to waste time on regexp analysis and compilation on our edge server. This requires extra time during initialization and memory for carrying unnecessary text sources of regular expressions around. PCRE allows regular expressions to be precompiled into its own format using pcre_compile. Then, we gather all these compiled regular expressions into one binary file and link it using <code>ld --format=binary</code> - a neat option that tells linker to attach any given binary file as a named data resource available to the application.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4oBelLGyvi8KGq7mQmTvFK/e5356dd36c37b29aa1fefccca167e43a/15748968831_9d97f7167f_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"640\" height=\"424\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">CC BY 2.0</a> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sidelong/15748968831/in/photolist-pZFzKn-nCgsND-5kmFQB-bm5Ny4-3qR9NP-NfYDG-e7AwCH-eqqc2o-e3DgoN-6ZcGVn-pkmTXn-3oT9Nj-8y4HB7-H93FUT-6pSxvu-aukZ2w-2yo3n-2fTgn7-dXH6No-nBzysU-nsnMR1-dHoz6o-zXDcxE-9G5ydk-HJPTCt-qoQnCi-zmKYcs-4vwvyV-ygPe2Q-rUH8dy-dSbR9U-sc8NEN-htr2XH-uDEHXF-ehnr4K-xDLoGG-gMbuTr-bygmuu-r26oQx-bDJmuS-7WHeZ7-o5V5nL-bn3PNf-9Fr7nQ-dbbuB6-4sGsph-77HwTg-gbA7WS-27jJRy-7xGShs\">image</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sidelong/\">DaveBleasdale</a></p><p>The second part of the rule is the replacement pattern which uses the simplest feature of JavaScript regex replacement - number-based groups and has the form of <code>https://www.google.com.$1/</code> which means that the resulting string should be concatenation of <code>&quot;https://www.google.com.&quot;</code> with the matched group at position <code>1</code>, and a <code>&quot;/&quot;</code>.</p><p>Once again, we don&#39;t want to waste time performing repetitive analysis looking for dollar signs and converting string indexes to numeric representation at runtime.
