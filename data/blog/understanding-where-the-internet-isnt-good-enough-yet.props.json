Or so it seems to those of us lucky enough to have fast, reliable (and often cheap) Internet access.</p><p>With a good connection you could keep working (if you were fortunate enough to have a job that could be done online), go to school or university, enjoy online entertainment like streaming movies and TV, games, keep up with the latest news, find out vital healthcare information, schedule a vaccination and stay in contact with loved ones and friends with whom you’d normally be spending time in person.</p><p>Without a good connection though, all those things were hard or impossible.</p><p>Sadly, access to the Internet is not uniformly distributed. Some have cheap, fast, low latency, reliable connections, others have some combination of expensive, slow, high latency and unreliable connections, still others have no connection at all. Close to 60% of the world have Internet access leaving a huge 40% without it at all.</p><p>This inequality of access to the Internet has real-world consequences. Without good access it is so much harder to communicate, to get vital information, to work and to study. Inequality of access isn’t a technical problem, it’s a societal problem.</p><p>This week, Cloudflare is announcing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/pangea\">Project Pangea</a> with the goal of helping reduce this inequality. We’re helping community networks get onto the Internet cheaply, securely and with good bandwidth and latency. We can&#39;t solve all the challenges of bringing fast, cheap broadband access to everyone (yet) but we can give fast, reliable transit to ISPs in underserved communities to help move in that direction. Please refer to our <a href=\"/pangea\">Pangea announcement</a> for more details.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"the-tyranny-of-averages\">The Tyranny of Averages</h2>\n      <a href=\"#the-tyranny-of-averages\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>To understand why Project Pangea is important, you need to understand how different the experience of accessing the Internet is around the world. From a distance, the world looks blue and green. But we all know that our planet varies wildly from place to place: deserts and rainforests, urban jungles and placid rural landscapes, mountains, valleys and canyons, volcanos, salt flats, tundra, and verdant, rolling hills.</p><p>Cloudflare is in a unique position to measure the performance and reach of the Internet over this vast landscape. We have servers in more than 200 cities in over 100 countries, we process 10s of trillions of Internet requests every month. Our network and customers and their users span the globe, every country in every network.</p><p>Zoom out to the level of a city, county, state, or country, and average Internet performance can look good — or, at least, acceptable. Zoom in, however, and the inequalities start to show. Perhaps part of a county has great performance, and another limps along at barely dial-up speeds — or worse. Or perhaps a city has some neighborhoods with fantastic fiber service, and others that are underserved and struggling with spotty access.</p><p>Inequality of Internet access isn’t a distant problem, it’s not limited to developing countries, it exists in the richest countries in the world as well as the poorest. There are still many parts of the world  where a Zoom call is hard or impossible to make. And if you’re reading this on a good Internet connection, you may be surprised to learn that places with poor or no Internet are not far from you at all.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"bandwidth-and-latency-in-eight-countries\">Bandwidth and Latency in Eight Countries</h2>\n      <a href=\"#bandwidth-and-latency-in-eight-countries\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>For Impact Week, we’ve analyzed Internet data in the United States, Brazil, United Kingdom, Germany, France, South Africa, Japan, and Australia to build a picture of Internet performance.</p><p>Below, you’ll find detailed maps of where the Internet is fast and slow (focusing on available bandwidth) and far away from the end user (at least in terms of the latency between the client and server). We’d have loved to have used a single metric, however, it’s hard for a single number to capture the distribution of good, bad, and non-existent Internet traffic in a region. It’s for that reason that we’ve used two metrics to represent performance: latency and bandwidth (otherwise known as throughput). The maps below are colored to show the differences in bandwidth and latency and answer part of the question: “How good is the Internet in different places around the world?”</p><p>As we like to say, we’re just getting started with this — we intend to make more of this data and analysis available in the near future.

High latency particularly affects things like online gaming where quick responses from servers are needed, but also shows up by slowing down the loading of complex web pages, and even interrupting some streaming video. Low bandwidth makes downloading anything slow: be it images on a webpage, the new app you want to try out on your phone, or the latest movie.</p><p>Blinking your eyes takes about 100ms; but you’ll begin to notice performance changes around 60ms of latency and below 30ms is gold class performance, seeing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/solutions/live-streaming/\">little to no delay in video streaming</a> or gaming.</p><p><b>United States</b></p><p><i>United States median throughput: 50.27Mbps</i></p><p><i>US median latency: 46.69ms</i></p><p>The US government has long recognized the importance of improving the Internet for underserved communities, but the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US agency responsible for determining where investment is most needed, has <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/features/millions-of-americans-cant-get-broadband-because-of-a-faulty-fcc-map-theres-a-fix/\">struggled</a> to accurately map Internet access across the country.  Although the FCC has embarked on a <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/BroadbandData\">new data collection effort</a> to improve the accuracy of existing maps, the US government still lacks a comprehensive understanding of the areas that would most benefit from broadband investment.</p><p>Cloudflare’s data confirms the overall concerns with inconsistent access to the Internet and helps fill in some of the current gaps.  A glance at the two maps of the US below will show that, even zoomed out to county level, there is inequality across the country.

Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Florida’s Orange County, Fairfax, San Bernardino, Knox County, and even San Francisco have pockets of uniformly poor performance, often while adjoining ZIP codes have stronger performance.</p><p>Even in areas with excellent Internet connectivity, the same connectivity to the same resources can cost wildly different amounts. Internet prices for end-users correlates with the number of ISPs in an area, i.e. the greater the consumer choice, the better the price. President Biden&#39;s recent competition Executive Order, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/\">called out</a> the lack of choice for broadband, noting <i>“More than 200 million U.S. residents live in an area with only one or two reliable high-speed internet providers, leading to prices as much as five times higher in these markets than in markets with more options.”</i></p><p>The following cities have the greatest choice of Internet providers:</p><table><tr><td><p><b>Geography</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>New York, New York</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Los Angeles, California</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chicago, Illinois</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dallas, Texas</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Washington, District of Columbia</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jersey City, New Jersey</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Newark, New Jersey</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Secaucus, New Jersey</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Columbus, Ohio</p></td></tr></table><p>One might expect less populated areas to have uniformly slower performance.

The problem isn’t just a rural one either, while the inner cities showed good broadband speed, often with fiber-to-the-building Internet access, suburban areas suffered. Larger suburban areas like the Illawarra had similar speeds to more rural centers like Wagga Wagga, showing this is more than just an urban divide.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7283atm713DjjNEVKGob4b/4d53a43bb38592a32735b710db5db332/image5-11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1642\" height=\"1260\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><table><tr><td><p><b>Best performing geographies by throughput</b></p></td><td><p><b>Worst performing geographies by throughput</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Inner West Sydney, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>West Tamar, Tasmania</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Port Phillip, Victoria</p></td><td><p>Bassendean, Western Australia</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Woollahra, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Alexandrina, South Australia</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Brimbank, Victoria</p></td><td><p>Bayswater, Western Australia</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lake Macquarie, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Augusta-Margaret River, Western Australia</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hawkesbury, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Goulburn Mulwaree, New South Wales</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sydney, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Goyder, South Australia</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Wentworth, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Kingborough, Tasmania</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hunters Hill, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Cottesloe, Western Australia</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Blacktown, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Lithgow, New South Wales</p></td></tr></table><p>The irony is that, from a latency perspective, Australia actually performs quite well.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5Bmyhn5UWmMgIK7eSLXTWB/81fc5dcdedb4abae91d96596bba61ec3/image1-23.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1526\" height=\"1026\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><table><tr><td><p><b>Best performing geographies by latency</b></p></td><td><p><b>Worst performing geographies by latency</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Port Phillip, Victoria</p></td><td><p>Narromine, New South Wales</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mornington Peninsula, Victoria</p></td><td><p>North Sydney, New South Wales</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Whittlesea, Victoria</p></td><td><p>Northern Midlands, Tasmania</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Penrith, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Swan, Western Australia</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mid-Coast, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Wanneroo, Western Australia</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Campbelltown, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Snowy Valleys, New South Wales</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Northern Beaches, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Parkes, New South Wales</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Strathfield, New South Wales</p></td><td><p>Broome, Western Australia</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Latrobe, Victoria</p></td><td><p>Griffith, New South Wales</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Surf Coast, Victoria</p></td><td><p>Busselton, Western Australia</p></td></tr></table><p><b>Japan</b></p><p><i>Japan median throughput: 61.4Mbps</i></p><p><i>Japan median latency: 31.89ms</i></p><p>Japan’s Internet has consistently low latency, including in distant areas such as Okinawa prefecture, 1,000 miles away from Tokyo.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5Z7XmnLiK51p7gK40qrjTo/5f426ef9b86cd12ab5d7c98b7da35702/image7-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1448\" height=\"1232\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><table><tr><td><p><b>Best performing geographies by latency</b></p></td><td><p><b>Worst performing geographies by latency</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nara</p></td><td><p>Yamagata</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Osaka</p></td><td><p>Okinawa</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Shiga</p></td><td><p>Miyazaki</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kōchi</p></td><td><p>Nagasaki</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kyoto</p></td><td><p>Ōita</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tochigi</p></td><td><p>Kagoshima</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tokushima</p></td><td><p>Yamaguchi</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Wakayama</p></td><td><p>Tottori</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kanagawa</p></td><td><p>Saga</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Aichi</p></td><td><p>Ehime</p></td></tr></table><p>However, it&#39;s a different story when it comes to bandwidth.

For the majority of counties, the largest ISP has 80% (or higher) share of traffic, while all the other ISPs combined operate at considerably smaller scale. In only three counties (Marion, Escambia and Etowah) does each ISP carry less than 50% of user traffic. Interestingly, Etowah is one of the best performing in the state, while Henry, a county where 98% of Internet traffic is concentrated behind a single ISP is the worst performing.</p><p>Where it gets interesting is when you plot the data, tracking the non-dominant ISP by traffic share (which is simply 100% less the traffic share of the dominant ISP) against the performance (as measured by download speed) and then use a linear line of best fit to find the relationship. Here’s what you get:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2e29pMHBg4GcN3zqiPHNT9/42cca12c03746e915b7145cbe40154ae/image12-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1330\" height=\"824\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As you can see, there is a strong positive relationship between the non-dominant ISP’s traffic share and the average download speed. As the non-dominant ISP increases its traffic share, Internet speeds tend to improve. The conclusion is clear: if you want to improve Internet performance in a region, foster more competition between multiple Internet service providers.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"the-other-performance-challenge-limited-isp-exchanges-and-tromboning\">The Other Performance Challenge: Limited ISP Exchanges, and Tromboning</h2>\n      <a href=\"#the-other-performance-challenge-limited-isp-exchanges-and-tromboning\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>There is more to the story, however, than just concentration. Alabama, like a lot of other regions that aren’t served well by ISPs, faces another performance challenge: poor routing, also sometimes known as “tromboning”.</p><p>Consider Tuskegee in Alabama, home to a local university.</p><p>In Tuskegee, choice is limited. Consumers only have a single choice for high-speed broadband. But even once an off-campus student has local access to the Internet, it isn’t truly local: Tuskegee students on a different ISP than their university will likely see their traffic detour all the way through Atlanta (two hours northeast by car!) before making its way back to school.</p><p>This doesn’t happen in isolation: today, the largest ISPs only exchange traffic with other networks in a handful of cities, notably Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Ashburn, and New York City.</p><p>If you’re in one of these big cities, you’re unlikely to suffer from tromboning. But if you’re not? Your Internet traffic can often have to travel further away before looping back, similar to the shape of a trombone, reducing your Internet performance. Tromboning contributes to inefficiency and drives up the cost of Internet access. An increasing amount of traffic is wastefully carried to cities far away, instead of keeping the data local.</p><p>You can visualize how your Internet traffic is flowing, by using tools like <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/203118044-Gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites#h_b8cebafd-9243-40e9-9c44-d4b94ccd3a87\">traceroute</a>.</p><p>As an example, we ran tests using <a href=\"http://atlas.ripe.net\">RIPE Atlas</a> probes to Facebook from Alabama, and unfortunately found extremes where traffic can sometimes take a highly circuitous route — traffic going to Atlanta, then Ashburn, Paris, Amsterdam, before making its way back to Alabama. The path begins on AT&amp;T&#39;s network and goes to Atlanta where it enters the network for Telia (an IP transit provider), crosses the Atlantic, meets Facebook, and then comes back.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3P0mnw0iZvAJYN7OuOAL5A/565de0862c4589fc67feea2283d83dfe/image13-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"518\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">Traceroute to 157.240.201.35 (157.240.201.35), 48 byte packets\n1- 192.168.6.1 1.435ms 0.912ms 0.636ms\n2-  99.22.36.1 99-22-36-1.lightspeed.dctral.sbcglobal.net AS7018 1.26ms 1.134ms 1.107ms\n3-  99.173.216.214 AS7018 3.185ms 3.173ms 3.099ms\n4-  12.122.140.70 cr84.attga.ip.att.net AS7018 11.572ms 13.552ms 15.038ms\n5 - * * *\n6- 192.205.33.42 AS7018 8.695ms 9.185ms 8.703ms\n7-  62.115.125.129 ash-bb2-link.ip.twelve99.net AS1299 23.53ms 22.738ms 23.012ms\n8-  62.115.112.243 prs-bb1-link.ip.twelve99.net AS1299 115.516ms 115.52ms 115.211ms\n9-  62.115.134.96 adm-bb3-link.ip.twelve99.net AS1299 113.487ms 113.405ms 113.25ms\n10-  62.115.136.195 adm-b1-link.ip.twelve99.net AS1299 115.443ms 115.703ms 115.45ms\n11- 62.115.148.231 facebook-ic331939-adm-b1.ip.twelve99-cust.net AS1299 134.149ms 113.885ms 114.246ms\n12- 129.134.51.84 po151.asw02.ams2.tfbnw.net AS32934 113.27ms 113.078ms 113.149ms\n13-  129.134.48.101 po226.psw04.ams4.tfbnw.net AS32934 114.529ms 114.439ms 117.257ms\n14-  157.240.38.227 AS32934 113.281ms 113.365ms 113.448ms\n15- 157.240.201.35 edge-star-mini-shv-01-ams4.facebook.com AS32934 115.013ms 115.223ms 115.112ms</pre></code>\n            <p>The intent here isn’t to shame AT&amp;T, Telia, or Facebook — nor is this challenge unique to them.
