We earned their trust by solving their problems in <a href=\"/cloudflare-waap-named-leader-gartner-magic-quadrant-2022/\">those</a> <a href=\"/cloudflare-is-named-a-leader-in-the-forrester-wave-for-ddos-mitigation-solutions/\">categories</a> and dozens of others. Today, over 100,000 customers now rely on Cloudflare to secure and deliver their Internet properties.</p><p>However, our conversations with <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/cio/\">CIOs</a> evolved over the last few years. The discussions stopped centering around a specific product. CIOs, and CSOs too, approached us with the challenge of managing connectivity and security for their entire enterprise. Whether they described their goals as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/\">Secure Access Service Edge</a> (SASE), their existing appliances and point solutions could no longer keep up. So we built <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/ppc/cloudflare-one/\">Cloudflare One</a> to help them.</p><p>Today, over 10,000 organizations trust Cloudflare One to connect and secure their users, devices, applications, and data. As part of CIO Week, we spoke with the leaders of some of our largest customers to better understand why they selected Cloudflare.</p><p>The feedback centered around six themes:</p><ol><li><p>Cloudflare One delivers more complete security.</p></li><li><p>Cloudflare One makes your team faster.</p></li><li><p>Cloudflare One is easier to manage.</p></li><li><p>Cloudflare One products work better together.</p></li><li><p>Cloudflare One is the most cost-efficient comprehensive SASE offering.</p></li><li><p>Cloudflare can be your single security vendor.</p></li></ol><p>If you are new to Cloudflare, or more familiar with our Internet property products, we’re excited to share how other customers approached this journey and why they partnered with Cloudflare. Today’s post breaks down their feedback in serious detail.

Their Internet properties relied on us for security and availability - our own policies mattered to their decisions to trust us.</p><p>That’s fair. We are a popular target for attack. However, we could not find anything on the market that could keep us safe without slowing us down. Instead, <a href=\"/securing-cloudflare-using-cloudflare/\">we decided</a> to use our own network to connect employees to internal resources and secure how those same team members connected to the rest of the Internet.</p><p>After learning what we built to replace our own private network, our customers started to ask if they could use it too. CIOs were on the same Zero Trust journey with us. They trusted our commitment to delivering the most comprehensive security on the market for their public-facing resources and started partnering with us to do the same thing for their entire enterprise.</p><p>We kept investing in Cloudflare One over the last several years based on feedback from our own internal teams and those CIOs. Our first priority was to <a href=\"/securing-cloudflare-using-cloudflare/\">replace</a> our internal network with a model that applies Zero Trust controls by default. We created controls that could adapt to the demands of security teams without the need to modify applications. We added rules to <a href=\"/how-cloudflare-implemented-fido2-and-zero-trust/\">force hard keys</a> on certain applications, restrict <a href=\"/two-clicks-to-enable-regional-zero-trust-compliance/\">access to specific countries</a>, or require users to <a href=\"/access-purpose-justification/\">ask for approval</a> from an administrator. The flexibility meant that every request, and every connection, could be scrutinized in a way that matched the sensitivity of internal tools.</p><p>We then turned that skepticism in the other direction. Customers on this journey with us asked “how could we have Zero Trust in the rest of the Internet?” To solve that, we turned Cloudflare’s network in the other direction. We built our DNS filtering product by combining the world’s fastest DNS resolver with <a href=\"/introducing-cloudforce-one-threat-operations-and-threat-research/\">our unique view</a> into <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">threat patterns on the Internet</a>. We layered on a comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/\">Secure Web Gateway</a> and network firewall. We sent potentially risky sites to Cloudflare’s isolated browser, a unique solution that <a href=\"/clientless-web-isolation-general-availability/\">pushes the industry forward</a> in terms of usability.</p><p>More recently, we started to create tools that help <a href=\"/casb-ga/\">control the data</a> sitting in SaaS applications and to <a href=\"/inline-dlp-ga/\">prevent sensitive data</a> from leaving the enterprise. We’ve been delighted to watch customers adopt every stage in this progression with us, but we kept comparing notes with other CIOs and CSOs about the risk of something that most vendors do not consider part of the SASE stack: email.</p><p>We also spent so many hours monitoring email-based phishing attacks aimed at Cloudflare. To solve that challenge, we deployed Area 1 Email Security. The <a href=\"/email-security/\">efficacy of Area 1</a> stunned our team to the point that we acquired the company, so we could offer the same <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/\">security</a> to our customers as part of Cloudflare One.</p><p>When CIOs describe the security challenges they need to solve, we can recommend a complete solution built on our experience addressing those same concerns. We cannot afford shortcuts in how we secure Cloudflare and know they cannot either in how they keep their enterprises safe.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"zero-trust-security-at-a-social-media-company\">Zero Trust security at a social media company</h3>\n      <a href=\"#zero-trust-security-at-a-social-media-company\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Like Cloudflare, social media services are a popular target for attack.

The performance of their Internet properties directly impacts revenue. These customers hunt down opportunities to use Cloudflare to shave off milliseconds.</p><p>The CIOs who approach us to solve their SASE problems tend to rank performance lower than security and maintainability. In early conversations they describe their performance goals as “good enough that my users do not complain.”</p><p>Those complaints drive IT help desk tickets, but CIOs are used to sacrificing speed for security. We don’t believe they should have to compromise. CIOs select Cloudflare One because the performance of our network improves the experience of their end users and reduces overhead for their IT administrators.</p><p>We accelerate your users from the first moment they connect. When your team members visit a destination on the Internet, their experience starts with a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/\">DNS query</a> to find the address of the website. Cloudflare runs the world’s fastest DNS resolver, <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/dns/\">1.1.1.1</a>, and the DNS filtering features of our SASE offering use the same technology.</p><p>Next, your users’ devices open a connection and send an HTTP request to their destination. The Cloudflare agent on their device does so by using a <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/boringtun\">BoringTun</a>, our Rust-based and <a href=\"/boringtun-userspace-wireguard-rust/\">open sourced WireGuard</a> implementation. WireGuard allows us to provide a highly-performant on-ramp to the Internet through our network without compromising battery life or security. The same technology supports the millions of users who choose to use our <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/\">WARP</a> consumer offering. We take their feedback and optimize WARP constantly to improve how our enterprise users connect.</p><p>Finally, your users rely on our network to connect them to their destination and return the responses. Out of the 3,000 top networks in the world, measured by IPv4 addresses advertised, <a href=\"/network-performance-update-developer-week/\">we rank the fastest in 1,310</a>. Once connected, we apply our <a href=\"/argo-v2/\">smart routing technology</a> to route users through our network to find the fastest path to and from their destination.</p><p>We develop new technologies to improve the speed of Cloudflare One, but we cannot change the speed of light. Instead, we make the distance shorter by bringing websites closer to your users. Cloudflare is the reverse proxy for more than 20% of the HTTP Internet. We serve those websites from the same data centers where your employees connect to our Secure Web Gateway. In many cases, we can deliver content from a server centimeters away from where we apply Cloudflare One’s filtering, shaving off milliseconds and reducing the need for more hops.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"faster-dns-filtering-for-the-united-states-federal-government\">Faster DNS filtering for the United States Federal Government</h3>\n      <a href=\"#faster-dns-filtering-for-the-united-states-federal-government\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) works within the United States Department of Homeland Security as the “nation’s risk advisor.”<sup>1</sup> Last year they launched a program to find a protective DNS resolver for the civilian government.

Hardware appliances or virtual equivalents require upfront deployment work and ongoing investment to maintain and upgrade them. Migrating to other cloud-based SASE vendors can reduce pain for some IT teams, but that is a low bar.</p><p>CIOs tell us that the ability to manage the solution is nearly as important as the security outcomes. If their selected vendor is difficult to deploy, the migration drags on and discourages adoption of more advanced features. If the solution is difficult to use or manage, team members find ways to avoid using it or IT administrators waste time.</p><p>We built Cloudflare One to make the most advanced SASE technologies available to teams of any size, including those that lack full IT departments. We invested in building a system that could be configured and deployed without operational overhead. Over 10,000 teams rely on Cloudflare One as a result.

The decision to migrate to a cloud-based solution can deliver immediate cost savings by eliminating the cost to continue to license and maintain that hardware or by avoiding the need for new capital expenditure to purchase the latest generation of hardware that can better attempt to support SSE Goals.</p><p>We’re happy to help you throw out those band-aid boxes. We’ve spent the last decade helping over 100,000 organizations get rid of their hardware in favor of a faster, safer, and more cost-efficient solution. However, we have seen CIOs approach us in the last year with a newer form of this problem: renewals. CIOs who first adopted a cloud-based <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/security-service-edge-sse/\">SSE solution</a> two or three years ago now describe extortionate price increases from their existing vendors.</p><p>Unlike Cloudflare, many of these vendors rely on dedicated appliances that struggle to scale with increased traffic. To meet that demand, they purchased more appliances and now need to find a way to bake that cost into the price they charge existing and new customers. Other vendors rely on public cloud providers to run their services. As those providers increase their costs, these vendors pass them on to their customers at a rate that scales with usage.</p><p>Cloudflare’s network provides a different model that allows Cloudflare One to deliver a comprehensive SASE offering that is more cost-efficient than anything in the market. Rather than deploying dedicated appliances, Cloudflare <a href=\"/cloudflares-gen-x-servers-for-an-accelerated-future/\">deploys commodity hardware</a> on top of which any Cloudflare service can run allowing us to scale up and down for any use case from our Bot Management features to our Workers, including our SASE products. We also purchase server hardware from <a href=\"/debugging-hardware-performance-on-gen-x-servers/\">multiple vendors in the exact same configuration</a>, providing us with supply chain flexibility and reducing the risk that any one component from a specific vendor drives up our hardware costs.</p><p>We <a href=\"/cloudflares-gen-x-servers-for-an-accelerated-future/\">obsess over the efficiency</a> of the computing costs of that hardware because we have no choice - over 20% of the world’s HTTP Internet relies on it today. Since every service can run on every server, including Cloudflare One, that investment in computing efficiency also benefits Cloudflare One. We also avoid the need to buy more hardware specifically for Cloudflare One capacity. We built our network to scale with the demands of some of the world’s largest Internet properties. That model allows us to absorb the traffic spikes of any enterprise SASE deployment without noticing.</p><p>However, Cloudflare One, like all of our network-driven products, has another cost component: transit. We need to reliably deliver your employee’s traffic to its destination. While that destination is increasingly on our network already if it uses our reverse proxy, sometimes employees need other websites.</p><p>Thankfully we’ve spent the last decade reducing or eliminating the cost of transit. In many cases, our reverse proxy <a href=\"/making-peering-easy-with-the-new-cloudflare-peering-portal/\">motivates exchanges and ISPs</a> to waive transit fees for us. It is in their best interest to provide their users with the fastest, most reliable, path to the ever-increasing number of websites that use our network. When we turn our network in the other direction for our SASE customers we still benefit from the same savings.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"cost-savings-at-an-african-infrastructure-company\">Cost-savings at an African infrastructure company</h3>\n      <a href=\"#cost-savings-at-an-african-infrastructure-company\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Earlier this year, an infrastructure based in South Africa came to Cloudflare with this exact problem.

Hundreds of enterprises who have adopted our SASE platform started as customers of our Application Services and Application Security products.</p><p>We’ve seen this take two forms. In one form, CIOs describe the challenge of stitching together multiple security point solutions into a single SASE deployment. They choose our network for the reasons described above; the CIO’s team benefits from features that work better together, and they avoid the need to maintain multiple systems.</p><p>In the second form, the migration to more cloud-based services across use cases ranging from SASE to public cloud infrastructure led to vendor bloat. We hear from customers who struggle to inventory which vendors their team has purchased and which of those services they even use.</p><p>That proliferation of vendors introduces more cost in terms of dollars and time. In financial terms, each vendor’s contract model might introduce new fees, like fixed platform costs, that would be redundant when paying for a single vendor. In management terms, every new vendor adds one more account manager to go find during issues or one more vendor to involve when debugging an issue that could impact multiple systems.</p><p>Bundling Cloudflare One with our Application Services, and Application Security, allows your organization to rely on a single vendor for every connection that you need to secure and accelerate.
