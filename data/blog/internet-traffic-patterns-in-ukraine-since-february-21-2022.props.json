Lowest in the hours after local midnight and picking up as people wake up. It’s not uncommon to see a dip around lunchtime and a peak when people go home in the evening. That pattern is clearly visible in this chart of overall Internet traffic seen by Cloudflare for Ukrainian networks on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday prior to the invasion.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/512rc9IE56VYMNbBnCBcmN/680b4b85791bf9cd4f2edbbed410baeb/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"841\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Starting Thursday, traffic was significantly lower. On Thursday, we saw about 70% of our normal request volume and about 60% on Friday. Request volumes recovered to 70% of pre-invasion volume on Saturday and Sunday before peaking on Monday and Tuesday because of attacks that we mitigated coming from networks in Ukraine.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1hCgAOFf5myXap0TsTd8qe/c2dd709e6405cc6da6eed2e0e09ed806/3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"812\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This chart shows attack traffic blocked by Cloudflare that originated on networks in Ukraine. Note that this is quite different from attacks against <code>.ua</code> domains, which can originate anywhere in the world and are discussed below.</p><p>Analysis of network traffic from different cities in Ukraine gives us some insight into people’s use of the Internet and availability of Internet access. Here’s Internet traffic from the capital, <b>Kyiv</b>:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2xhbh5iTAQDTrkCrDTQF7T/7c22e4b911f9a9f560d13967efa4f050/4-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"670\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Once again the “normal” ebb and flow of Internet traffic is seen on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Early on Thursday morning, Internet traffic picks up after Vladimir Putin’s announcement of the attack but never reaches normal levels that day. Friday is even lower, but traffic in Kyiv has gradually increased since then.</p><p>Moving westward to <b>Lviv,</b> we see a very different pattern of use.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2Uv1YjPoLdT1wUIXpHU3o8/21bb430f35cf1df22d5c82fd2bf83c81/5-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"646\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The same normal flows on Monday to Wednesday are visible, followed by a smaller drop for three days and then a dramatic increase in traffic. As many Ukrainians have moved westward towards Poland, Slovakia and Romania, away from the fighting, it appears that Internet traffic has grown with their arrival in Lviv.</p><p>The city of <b>Uzhhorod</b> on the Slovakian border shows a similar pattern.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5Fe2jz2XHogeQja6Z8MHDn/464941d6ceecdfd524e526c6851ef7c7/6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"660\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>To the east of Lviv, the city of <b>Ternopil</b> has also seen an increase in Internet traffic.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4dkfXY8F4zhVpNVt6PcJLF/6c728c3850a886f275351812a2820ca7/7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"649\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As has <b>Rivne</b>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1FSqAgYIIWm2PFYR2YusPd/9c3adc5bf9353c1963cc70695c56c606/Rivne.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"641\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Looking at Rivne, Ternopil, Uzhhorod, and Lviv, it’s possible that the peaks in Internet traffic on different days show the movement of people westward as they try to escape fighting around the capital and in the east and south.</p><p>On the opposite side of Ukraine, the situation is quite different. Here’s the traffic pattern for the city of <b>Kharkiv</b>.
