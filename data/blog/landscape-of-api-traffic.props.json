Whether it is a new mobile app to find your soulmate, the latest wearable to monitor your vitals, or an industrial solution to detect corrosion, our life is becoming packed with connected systems.</p><p>How is the Internet changing because of this shift? This blog provides an overview of how Internet traffic is evolving as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/api/what-is-an-api/\">Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</a> have taken the centre stage among the communication technologies. With help from the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> team, we have harnessed the data from our global network to provide this snapshot of global APIs in 2021.</p><p>The huge growth in API traffic comes at a time when Cloudflare has been introducing new technologies that protect applications from nascent threats and vulnerabilities. The release of <a href=\"/introducing-api-shield/\">API Shield</a> with <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/products/api-discovery\">API Discovery</a>, <a href=\"/protecting-apis-from-abuse-and-data-exfiltration/\">Schema Validation</a>, <a href=\"/protecting-apis-from-abuse-and-data-exfiltration/\">mTLS</a> and <a href=\"/api-abuse-detection/\">API Abuse Detection</a> has provided customers with a set of tools designed to protect their applications and data based on how APIs work and their challenges.</p><p>We are also witnessing increased adoption of new protocols. Among encryption protocols, for example, TLS v1.3 has become the most used protocol for APIs on Cloudflare while, for transport protocols, we saw an uptake of QUIC and gRPC (Cloudflare support announced in <a href=\"/the-quicening/\">2018</a> and <a href=\"/announcing-grpc/\">2020</a> respectively).</p><p>In the following sections we will quantify the growth of APIs and identify key industries affected by this shift. We will also look at the data to better understand the source and type of traffic we see on our network including how much malicious traffic our security systems block.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"why-is-api-use-exploding\">Why is API use exploding?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#why-is-api-use-exploding\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>By working closely with our customers and observing the broader trends and data across our network in application security, we have identified three main trends behind API adoption: how applications are built is changing, API-first businesses are thriving, and finally machine-to-machine and human-to-machine communication is evolving.</p><p>During the last decade, APIs became popular because they allowed developers to separate backend and frontend, thus creating applications with better user experience. The <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-jamstack/\">Jamstack architecture</a> is the most recent trend highlighting this movement, where technologies such as JavaScript, APIs and markup are being used to create responsive and high-performance applications. The growth of microservices and serverless architectures are other drivers behind using efficient HTTP-powered application interfaces.</p><p>APIs are also enabling companies to innovate their business models. Across many industries there is a trend of modularizing complex processes by integrating self-contained workflows and operations. The product has become the service delivered via APIs, allowing companies to scale and monetize their new capabilities. Financial Services is a prime example where a monolithic industry with vertically integrated service providers is giving way to a more fragmented landscape. The new Open Banking standard (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en\">PSD2</a>) is an example of how small companies can provide modular financial services that can be easily integrated into larger applications. Companies like <a href=\"https://truelayer.com/\">TrueLayer</a> have productized APIs, allowing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/\">e-commerce organizations</a> to onboard new sellers to a marketplace within seconds or to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/\">deliver more efficient payment options</a> for their customers. A similar shift is happening in the logistics industry as well, where <a href=\"https://goshippo.com/\">Shippo</a> allows the same e-commerce companies to integrate with services to initiate deliveries, print labels, track goods and streamline the returns process. And of course, everything is powered by APIs.</p><p>Finally, the increase of connected devices such as wearables, sensors and robots are driving more APIs, but another aspect of this is the way manual and repetitive tasks are being automated. Infrastructure-as-Code is an example of relying on APIs to replace manual processes that have been used to manage Internet Infrastructure in the past. Cloudflare is itself a product of this trend as our solutions allow customers to <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/\">use services like Terraform</a> to configure how their infrastructure should work with our products.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"labelling-traffic\">Labelling traffic</h2>\n      <a href=\"#labelling-traffic\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The data presented in the following paragraphs is based on the total traffic proxied by Cloudflare and traffic is classified according to the Content-Type header generated in the response phase.

Traffic generated by identified bots is not included.</p><p>When looking at trends, we compare data from the first week of February 2021 to the first week of December 2021. We chose these dates to compare how traffic changed over the year but excluding January which is affected by the holiday season.</p><p>Specifically, API traffic is labelled based on responses with types equal <code>application/json</code>, <code>application/xml</code>, and <code>text/xml</code>, while Web accounts for <code>text/html</code>, <code>application/x-javascript</code>, <code>application/javascript</code>, <code>text/css</code>, and <code>text/javascript</code>. Requests categorised as Text are <code>text/plain</code>; Binary are <code>application/octet-stream</code>; Media includes all image types, video and audio.</p><p>Finally, <code>Other</code> catches everything that doesn’t clearly fall into the labels above, which includes <code>empty</code> and <code>unknown</code>. Part of this traffic might be API and the categorisation might be missing due to the client or server not adding a Content-Type header.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"api-use-in-2021\">API use in 2021</h2>\n      <a href=\"#api-use-in-2021\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We begin by examining the current state of API traffic at our global network and the types of content served.

Here, the browser loads an HTML page and populates dynamic fields by generating AJAX API calls against the backend service. This paradigm has become the de-facto standard as it provides an effective way to build dynamic yet flexible Web applications.</p><p>The next 56% comes from non-browsers, including mobile apps and IoT devices with a long tail of different types (wearables, connected sport equipment, gaming platforms and more). Finally, approximately 6% are “unknown” and since well-behaving browsers and tools like <a href=\"https://curl.se/\">curl</a> send a User-Agent by default, one could attribute much of this unknown to programmatic or automated tools, some of which could be malicious.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7qeqIrgnMNxhYKb3ekZFhf/896b1085647de080a38cee6ecc0ecaed/image7-14.png\" alt=\"Distribution of User-Agent headers for API traffic. ‘Non-browser’ makes up for more than half of the traffic.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1438\" height=\"426\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"encryption\">Encryption</h3>\n      <a href=\"#encryption\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>A key aspect of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/api-security/\">securing APIs against snooping and tampering</a> is encrypting the session. Clients use SSL/TLS to authenticate the server they are connecting with, for example, by making sure it is truly their cryptocurrency vendor. The benefit of transport layer encryption is that after handshaking, all application protocol bytes are encrypted, providing both confidentiality and integrity assurances.</p><p>Cloudflare <a href=\"/introducing-tls-1-3/\">launched the latest version of TLS (v1.3)</a> in September 2016, and it was <a href=\"/you-get-tls-1-3-you-get-tls-1-3-everyone-gets-tls-1-3/\">enabled by default on some properties</a> in May 2018. When looking at API traffic today, TLS v1.3 is the most adopted protocol with 55.9% of traffic using it. The vulnerable v1.0  and v1.1 were <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8996\">deprecated in March 2021</a> and their use has virtually disappeared.</p><table><tr><td><p><b>Transport security protocol</b></p></td><td><p><b>December 2021</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLS 1.3</p></td><td><p>55.9%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLS 1.2</p></td><td><p>32.7%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>QUIC</p></td><td><p>8.4%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>2.8%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLS 1.0</p></td><td><p>0.3%</p></td></tr></table><p>The protocol that is growing fastest is QUIC. While QUIC can be used to carry many types of application protocols, Cloudflare has so far focused on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/\">HTTP/3</a>, the mapping of HTTP over IETF QUIC. We <a href=\"/the-quicening/\">started supporting</a> draft versions of QUIC in 2018 and when QUIC version 1 was published as RFC 9000 in May 2021, we <a href=\"/quic-version-1-is-live-on-cloudflare/\">enabled it for everyone</a> the next day. QUIC uses the TLS 1.3 handshake but has its own mechanism for protecting and securing packets. Looking at HTTP-based API traffic, we see HTTP/3 going from less than 3% in early February 2021 to more than 8% in December 2021. This growth broadly aligns RFC 9000 being published and during the periodHTTP/3 support being stabilized and enabled in a range of client implementations.</p><p>Mutual TLS, which is often used for mobile or IoT devices, accounts for 0.3% of total API traffic. Since we <a href=\"/introducing-tls-client-auth/\">released the first version of mTLS</a> in 2017 we’ve seen a growing number of inquiries from users across all Cloudflare plans, as we have recently made it easier for customers to start using mTLS with Cloudflare <a href=\"/introducing-api-shield/\">API Shield</a>. Customers can now use Cloudflare dashboard to issue and manage certificates with one-click avoiding all the complexity of having to manage a Private Key Infrastructure and root certificates themselves.</p><p>Finally, unencrypted traffic can provide a great opportunity for attackers to access plain communications. The total unencrypted API traffic dropped from 4.6% of total requests in early 2021 to 2.6% in December 2021. This represents a significant step forward in establishing basic security for all API connections.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n      <a href=\"#security\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Given the huge amount of traffic that Cloudflare handles every second, we can look for trends in blocked traffic and identify common patterns in threats or attacks.</p><p>When looking at the Cloudflare security systems, an HTML request is twice as likely to be blocked than an API request. Successful response codes (200, 201, 301 and 302) account for 91% of HTML and 97% of API requests, while 4XX error codes (like 400, 403, 404) are generated for 2.8% of API calls as opposed to 7% of HTML. Calls returning 5XXs codes (such as Internal Server Error, Bad Gateway, Service Unavailable) are almost nonexistent for APIs (less than 0.2% of calls) while are almost 2% of requests for HTML.</p><p>The relatively larger volume of unmitigated API requests can be explained by the automated nature of APIs, for example more API calls are generated in order to render a page that would require a single HTML request. Malicious or malformed requests are therefore diluted in a larger volume of calls generated by well-behaving automated systems.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7EU8nQUjXvKSj3S72nO66X/2c7da9c082dbdf499f0bb5b6ebe8b3d8/image1-20.png\" alt=\"Breakdown of response codes as percentage of total traffic (JSON vs HTML).\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1548\" height=\"756\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We can further analyse the frequency of specific error codes to get a sense of what the most frequent malformed (and possibly malicious) requests are. In the following figure, we plot the share of a particular error code when compared to all 4XXs.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2IKN7Mb3ALR2tAveQm2S3n/f1e34b5872298269f103fc3d08eb771f/image5-16.png\" alt=\"Most common error codes for API traffic.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We can identify three groups of issues all equally likely (excluding the more obvious “404 Not Found” case): “400 Bad Request” (like malformed, invalid request), “429 Too Many Requests” (“Rate Limiting”), and the combination of Authentication and Authorization issues (“403 Forbidden” and “401 Unauthorized”). Those codes are followed by a long tail of other errors, including “422 Unprocessable Entity”, “409 Conflict”, and “402 Payment Required”.</p><p>This analysis confirms that the most common attacks rely on sending non-compliant requests, brute force efforts (24% of generated 4XXs are related to rate limiting), and accessing resources with invalid authentication or permission.</p><p>We can further analyse the reason why calls were blocked (especially relative to the 400s codes) by looking at what triggered the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/\">Cloudflare WAF</a>. The OWASP and the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset are tools that scan incoming traffic looking for fingerprints of known vulnerabilities (such as SQLi, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/how-to-prevent-xss-attacks/\">XSS</a>, etc.) and they can provide context on what attack was detected.</p><p>A portion of the blocked traffic has triggered a managed rule for which we can identify the threat category. Although a malicious request can match multiple categories, the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">WAF</a> assigns it to the first threat that is identified. User-Agent anomaly is the most common reason why traffic is blocked. This is usually triggered by the lack of or by a malformed User-Agent header, capturing requests that do not provide enough credible information on what type of client has sent the request. The next most common threat is cross-site scripting. After these two categories, there is a long tail of other anomalies that were identified.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/22mNr1Cl33LwwoqsCj9NNi/b05a6096d72f656933d1478e6b756d64/image3-28.png\" alt=\"Top attack types as identified by Cloudflare Managed Rulesets.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1664\" height=\"908\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n      <a href=\"#conclusions\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>More than one out of two requests we process is an API call, and industries such as Banking, Retail and Financial Services are leading in terms of adoption and growth.</p><p>Furthermore, API calls are growing twice as fast as HTML traffic, making it an ideal candidate for new <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/security/\">security solutions</a> aimed at protecting customer data.</p>",
