If a server is bombarded with more requests than it can process, the server will drop legitimate requests and — in some cases — crash, resulting in degraded performance or an outage for legitimate users.</p><h4>Q3 ‘21 was the quarter of Meris — one of the most powerful botnets deployed to launch some of the largest HTTP DDoS attacks in history.</h4><p>This past quarter, we observed <a href=\"/cloudflare-thwarts-17-2m-rps-ddos-attack-the-largest-ever-reported/\">one of the largest recorded HTTP attacks</a> — 17.2M rps (requests per second) — targeting a customer in the financial services industry. One of the most powerful botnets ever observed, called Meris, is known to be deployed in launching these attacks.</p><p>Meris (Latvian for plague) is a botnet behind recent DDoS attacks that have targeted networks or organizations around the world. The Meris botnet infected routers and other networking equipment manufactured by the Latvian company MikroTik. According to MikroTik’s blog, a vulnerability in the MikroTik RouterOS (that was patched after its detection back in 2018) was exploited in still unpatched devices to build a botnet and launch coordinated DDoS attacks by bad actors.</p><p>Similar to the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/\">Mirai botnet</a> of 2016, Meris is one of the most powerful botnets recorded. While Mirai infected IoT devices with low computational power such as smart cameras, Meris is a growing swarm of networking infrastructure (such as routers and switches) with significantly higher processing power and data transfer capabilities than IoT devices — making them much more potent in causing harm at a larger scale. Be that as it may, Meris is an example of how the attack volume doesn’t necessarily guarantee damage to the target. As far as we know, Meris, despite its strength, was not able to cause significant impact or Internet outages. On the other hand, by tactically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS_attack_on_Dyn\">targeting the DYN DNS service in 2016</a>, Mirai succeeded in causing significant Internet disruptions.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"application-layer-ddos-attacks-by-industry\">Application-layer DDoS attacks by industry</h3>\n            <a href=\"#application-layer-ddos-attacks-by-industry\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><b>The tech and gaming industries were the most targeted industries in Q3 ‘21.</b></p><p>When we break down the application-layer attacks targeted by industry, Computer Software companies topped the charts.

One is the volume of traffic it delivers, measured as the bit rate (specifically, terabits per second or gigabits per second). Another is the number of packets it delivers, measured as the packet rate (specifically, millions of packets per second).</p><p>Attacks with high bit rates attempt to cause a denial-of-service event by clogging the Internet link, while attacks with high packet rates attempt to overwhelm the servers, routers, or other in-line hardware appliances. Appliances dedicate a certain amount of memory and computation power to process each packet. Therefore, by bombarding it with many packets, the appliance can be left with no further processing resources. In such a case, packets are “dropped,” i.e., the appliance is unable to process them. For users, this results in service disruptions and denial of service.</p><p>The distribution of attacks by their size (in bit rate) and month is shown below.

They can only learn from it in their post-attack analysis, then deploy a new rule that filters the attack fingerprint and hope to catch it next time. Similarly, using an “on-demand” service, where the security team will redirect traffic to a DDoS provider during the attack, is also inefficient because the attack will already be over before the traffic routes to the on-demand DDoS provider.</p><p>Cloudflare recommends that companies use automated, always-on DDoS protection services that analyze traffic and apply real-time fingerprinting fast enough to block the short-lived attacks. Cloudflare analyzes traffic out-of-path, ensuring that DDoS mitigation does not add any latency to legitimate traffic, even in always-on deployments. Once an attack is identified, our autonomous edge DDoS protection system (<a href=\"/deep-dive-cloudflare-autonomous-edge-ddos-protection/\">dosd</a>) generates and applies a dynamically crafted rule with a real-time signature.

As a part of the TCP handshake, the client sends an initial connection request packet with a synchronize flag (SYN). The server responds with a packet that contains a synchronized acknowledgment flag (SYN-ACK). Finally, the client responds with an acknowledgment (ACK) packet. At this point, a connection is established and data can be exchanged until the connection is closed. This stateful process can be abused by attackers to cause denial-of-service events.</p><p>By repeatedly sending SYN packets, the attacker attempts to overwhelm a server or the router’s connection table that tracks the state of TCP connections. The server replies with a SYN-ACK packet, allocates a certain amount of memory for each given connection, and falsely waits for the client to respond with the final ACK. Given a sufficient number of connections occupying the server’s memory, the server is unable to allocate further memory for legitimate clients, causing the server to crash or preventing it from handling legitimate client connections, i.e., a denial-of-service event.</p><p>More than half of all attacks observed over our network were SYN floods.

We are able to achieve geographical accuracy in our report because we have data centers in <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/network\">over 250 cities</a> around the world.</p><h4>Worldwide</h4>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2mpDYFQKy9GOIoJkGbnntr/d38114debdb65a05ef4e9b51e8570464/image12-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>To view all regions and countries, check out the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/notebooks/ddos-2021-q3#network-layer-ddos-attacks-by-country\">Radar DDoS Report dashboard’s interactive map</a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"a-note-on-recent-attacks-on-voice-over-ip-service-providers-and-ransom-ddos-attacks\">A note on recent attacks on voice over-IP service providers — and ransom DDoS attacks</h3>\n            <a href=\"#a-note-on-recent-attacks-on-voice-over-ip-service-providers-and-ransom-ddos-attacks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6EzEvtPaswPIEik7EsnQZq/327aba3e45924d43cf71dd629436bd88/image25-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1360\" height=\"772\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We <a href=\"/attacks-on-voip-providers/\">recently reported</a> and <a href=\"/update-on-voip-attacks/\">provided an update</a> on the surge in DDoS attacks on VoIP service providers — some of who have also received ransom threats. As of early Q4 ‘21, this attack campaign is still ongoing and current. At Cloudflare, we continue to onboard VoIP service providers and shield their applications and networks against attacks.</p><p>HTTP attacks against <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/api/what-is-an-api-gateway/\">API gateways</a> and the corporate websites of the providers have been combined with network-layer and transport-layer attacks against VoIP infrastructures.</p><p>Examples include:</p><ol><li><p><b>TCP floods targeting stateful firewalls:</b> These are being used in “trial-and-error” type attacks. They are not very effective against telephony infrastructure specifically (because it is mostly UDP) but very effective at overwhelming stateful firewalls.</p></li><li><p><b>UDP floods targeting SIP infrastructure:</b> Floods of UDP traffic that have no well-known fingerprint, aimed at critical VoIP services. Generic floods like this may look like legitimate traffic to unsophisticated filtering systems.</p></li><li><p><b>UDP reflection targeting SIP infrastructure:</b> These methods, when targeted at SIP or RTP services, can easily overwhelm Session Border Controllers (SBCs) and other telephony infrastructure. The attacker seems to learn enough about the target’s infrastructure to target such services with high precision.</p></li><li><p><b>SIP protocol-specific attacks:</b> Attacks at the application layer are of particular concern because of the higher resource cost of generating application errors versus filtering on network devices.</p></li></ol><p>Organizations also continue to receive ransom notes that threaten attacks in exchange for bitcoin. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/ransomware/what-is-ransomware/\">Ransomware</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ransom-ddos-attack/\">ransom DDoS</a> attacks, for the fourth consecutive quarter, continue to be a germane threat to organizations all over the world.</p><p>Cloudflare products close off several threat vectors that can lead to a ransomware infection and ransom DDoS attacks:</p><ul><li><p>Cloudflare <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-dns-filtering/\">DNS filtering</a> blocks unsafe websites.</p></li><li><p>Cloudflare <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/browser-isolation/\">Browser Isolation</a> prevents drive-by downloads and other browser-based attacks.</p></li><li><p>A <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust</a> architecture can help <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/ransomware/how-to-prevent-ransomware/\">prevent ransomware from spreading</a> within a network.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/\">Magic Transit</a> protects organizations’ networks against <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/how-to-prevent-ddos-attacks/\">DDoS attacks</a> using BGP route redistribution — without impacting latency.</p></li></ul>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"helping-build-a-better-internet\">Helping build a better Internet</h2>\n            <a href=\"#helping-build-a-better-internet\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare was founded on the mission to help build a better Internet.
