Springtime is here, and national holidays give people more time off. Between April 7 and 10, 2023, Easter was celebrated in dozens of countries worldwide. One week later, on April 16, it was time for the Orthodox Easter. Did the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter\">Christian holiday</a> have an impact on Internet traffic trends?</p><p>Spoiler alert: in several countries, it did. In Italy, Poland, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, the US, Mexico, and Australia, the Easter long weekend, with or without chocolate Easter bunnies or eggs, had one of the days with the least traffic of 2023 so far, more than 100 days into the year.</p><p>If we had to pick “winners”, in terms of Easter online impact, we would have an Easter Sunday podium with: <b>Poland (22% drop in traffic), Italy (18%), France (16%)</b>. Mexico and Spain have special mentions, given that both were impacted during the “Semana Santa”, Holy Week.</p><p>In terms of the Easter Sunday lunch, Italy seems to have no match, given that traffic dropped 38% at around 13:00 local time. Spain took the Good Friday lunch Internet impact prize (28% drop ~13:00).</p><p>To do this comparison, we’re using Cloudflare’s worldwide data that could be seen and used in action (live) on <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a>, given that we help more than 20% of websites on the Internet. Although the charts presented are in UTC, we’re using local time in the text for local clarity.</p><p>Next, we are selecting countries where Christianity is prominent, and there are clear Easter “egg” Internet trends. It will become evident that there are Easter days more impactful in some countries than Easter Sunday itself. We also show some Orthodox Easter (where Greece is most impacted), Ramadan and Passover trends. This is a year when several of the religious celebrations occurred around the same time, something that is not common, although it also happened last year.

Although those two days are not in our Top five list of 2023 days with the lowest traffic, so far, April 16 was the second Sunday with the least traffic since January, only matched by March 26. Bear in mind that with the <a href=\"/one-year-of-war-in-ukraine/\">war, attacks on energy infrastructure</a> also have played a role in drops in the country’s Internet traffic. On Orthodox Easter, during lunch and dinner time, traffic was also lower than usual (compared to the previous Sunday), with a 10% drop at around 15:00 and 20:00 local time.</p><p>In Greece, there’s no doubt whatsoever: April 16, Orthodox Easter, is the day in 2023, so far, with the lowest traffic. The Top five list of days with the least traffic, include four days of the Easter week:</p><p><i>#1. Orthodox Easter, April 16 (-26%, compared with the previous week)</i>#2. January 1<i>#3.

For Muslims, it is a period of introspection, communal prayer and also of fasting every day from dawn to sunset. That means that people only eat at night (Iftar is the first meal after sunset that breaks the fast and often serves as a family or community event), and also before sunrise (Suhur).</p><p>Last year, we wrote a <a href=\"/how-ramadan-shows-up-in-internet-trends/\">trends deep dive blog post</a> about it over the month period, and unsurprisingly, we’re seeing similar trends this year. The impact on Internet traffic in some countries is clear. Traffic decreases during Iftar, the first meal after sunset, and increases before sunrise, as people wake up to eat.</p><p>Now, let&#39;s see if the trend is consistent in 2023 for some countries. Looking at Turkey, on March 23 around 19:00 local time, traffic was 23% lower than the previous week, and was 74% higher at around 05:00. It’s similar in Syria, where there’s less traffic during the day.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7J0q8zOHZJBRUTSBHFfSZM/8f302287fb82c95b35078e54c9b19389/download--12-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>While in Turkey, we can also show the daily impact of the February 5 late night, magnitude 7.8 earthquake, on the Internet traffic of the country. We’ve followed that for a few weeks in our Radar Twitter account, and also in our latest <a href=\"/q1-2023-internet-disruption-summary/\">Internet disruptions overview for Q1 2023 blog post</a>. The daily drop in traffic from Sunday, February 5, to the next day, was 26%, and it was 19% lower compared to the same day of the previous week. This next chart also shows that the #2 day with the least traffic in March, was March 23, when Ramadan started.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3k4rLTBwxJJw9X73rnUstc/84dccd9225f227fff427b6589632dc62/download--13-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"671\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Moving on to the United Arab Emirates, for example, Internet traffic on March 23 was 18% lower around 18:00 local time than in the previous week. And it was 42% higher at around 05:00, before sunrise. Usually, at least in the last month, traffic in the country is lower on Sundays.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/17YBld9jqvIbLteNYXgrEx/68c416d798454e87466078487072a61f/download--14-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Internet traffic in Indonesia, the country with the largest Muslim population, sees similar patterns. On March 23, traffic dropped 20% at 18:00 local time and rose 31% at 04:00 before sunrise. Traffic is slightly lower than usual during the day since Ramadan started.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5C7YGWXLnKvF8iMw6muBZ/c8f6ab61713134f4ee52fc25c02dd307/download--15-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Other examples of countries with Internet traffic patterns clearly impacted by Ramadan include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran. <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> shows them all, and more.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"internet-in-2023-the-stage-where-human-cultures-still-play-a-role\">Internet in 2023, the stage where human cultures (still) play a role</h2>\n            <a href=\"#internet-in-2023-the-stage-where-human-cultures-still-play-a-role\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Through Cloudflare’s view of the Internet, something that enables us to keep security, performance and privacy at a high level, we’ve seen how ancient traditions, beliefs and cultures continue to play a role in different countries on Earth, in 2023.</p><p>It could be Easter, Passover or Ramadan, those traditions change Internet traffic patterns in several countries on Earth, simply because the Internet was made by and for humans, and is used by us every day.
