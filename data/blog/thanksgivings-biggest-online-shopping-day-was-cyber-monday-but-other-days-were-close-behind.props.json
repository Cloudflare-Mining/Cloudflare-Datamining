Those days have a big traffic peak, but the Black Friday week has more sustained traffic over five days.</p><p>When we look just at last week, Black Friday isn’t actually the most popular day, it’s Monday, November 22 — that isn’t surprising given that shoppers also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-black-friday-shoppers-tapered-online-splurge-some-returned-stores-2021-11-27/\">“returned to stores”</a> on Black Friday 2021 and didn&#39;t do everything online.</p><p>Despite this, Black Friday 2021 had definitely more sustained traffic throughout the day.
