As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, it&#39;s essential to adopt a security approach that assumes that all access is unauthorized, rather than relying on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-the-network-perimeter/\">network perimeter-based security</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust</a> is a security model that requires all users and devices to be authenticated and authorized before being granted access to applications and data. This approach offers a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/\">comprehensive security solution</a> that is particularly effective in today&#39;s distributed and cloud-based environments.

Ping Identity and Cloudflare Access can be used together to secure applications by enforcing strong authentication and access controls.</p><p>One of the key features of Ping Identity is its ability to provide single sign-on (SSO) capabilities, allowing users to log in once and be granted access to all applications they are authorized to use. This feature streamlines the authentication process, reducing the risk of password fatigue and making it easier for organizations to manage access to multiple applications.</p><p>Cloudflare Access, on the other hand, provides Zero Trust access to applications, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. With Cloudflare Access, policies can be easily created and managed in one place, making it easier to ensure clear and consistent policy enforcement across all applications. Policies can include specific <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/mfa-requirements/\">types of MFA</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/\">device posture</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/external-evaluation/\">even custom logic</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3lHZq8Le2pjp6fSePPNfbs/0f05ae20b0b8301e66dd2b005ca323b7/image2-12.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"948\" height=\"616\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"securing-custom-applications-with-access-and-ping\">Securing custom applications with Access and Ping</h3>\n      <a href=\"#securing-custom-applications-with-access-and-ping\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Legacy applications pose a significant security risk to organizations as they may contain vulnerabilities that are no longer patched or updated. However, businesses can use Cloudflare and Ping Identity to help secure legacy applications and reduce the risk of cyberattacks.</p><p>Legacy applications may not support modern authentication methods, such as SAML or OIDC, which makes security controls like MFA easier to enforce, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access. By integrating Ping Identity with Cloudflare Access, businesses can enforce MFA and SSO for users accessing legacy applications. This can help ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and reduce the risk of credential theft and account takeover.</p><p>For example, many organizations have legacy applications that lack modern security features like MFA or SSO. This is because direct code modifications were previously required to implement modern security features. Code modifications of legacy applications can be risky, difficult or even impossible in some situations. By integrating these applications with Ping Identity and Cloudflare Access, organizations can enforce stronger security controls, making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information.
