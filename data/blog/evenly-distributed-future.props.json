For example, a customer may want to start optimizing their web site for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2; because CloudFlare offers HTTP/2 service they can quickly start testing different configurations in the real world.</p><p>Or a customer may want to start experimenting with <a href=\"/announcing-support-for-http-2-server-push-2/\">HTTP/2 Server Push</a> to see how much of a speedup they can obtain for their web site or app. Once again, CloudFlare makes that available.</p><p>Or a customer may have realized that IPv6 is fast becoming an important technology because it&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/28/ipv6_now_faster_a_fifth_of_the_time/\">faster</a> than IPv4 in many cases. CloudFlare has provided IPv6 for years.</p><p>Equally, CloudFlare gains useful experience from testing and deploying new technologies. We recently spent time doing a <a href=\"/results-experimenting-brotli/\">deep analysis</a> of the Brotli compression algorithm to understand how it would perform for our customers. It’s up and running on our <a href=\"https://http2.cloudflare.com/\">public test server</a> for those that like to live on the bleeding edge.</p><p>Equally, we&#39;ve rolled cryptographic algorithms like <a href=\"/do-the-chacha-better-mobile-performance-with-cryptography/\">ChaCha20-Poly1305</a> to give mobile users fast, secure connections with better battery life. We&#39;re now experimenting with <a href=\"/ietf-hackathon-getting-tls-1-3-working-in-the-browser-2/\">TLS 1.3</a> to ensure that our customers stay up to date with the latest in secure Internet.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n      <a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Web performance, web security and web attacks evolve and improve rapidly.
