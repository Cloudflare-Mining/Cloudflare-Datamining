Where in the past we had to mock APIs to get some packages running, now those APIs are supported natively by the Workers Runtime.</p><p>This has changed how we can build tools on Cloudflare Workers. When we first implemented <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/\"><u>Playwright</u></a>, a popular framework for web testing and automation that runs on <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/\"><u>Browser Rendering</u></a>, we had to rely on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/memfs\"><u>memfs</u></a>. This was bad because not only is memfs a hack and an external dependency, but it also forced us to drift away from the official Playwright codebase. Thankfully, with more Node.js compatibility, we were able to start using <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/playwright/pull/62/changes\"><u>node:fs natively</u></a>, reducing complexity and maintainability, which makes upgrades to the latest versions of Playwright easy to do.</p><p>The list of Node.js APIs we support natively keeps growing. The blog post “<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/nodejs-workers-2025/\"><u>A year of improving Node.js compatibility in Cloudflare Workers</u></a>” provides an overview of where we are and what we’re doing.</p><p>We measure this progress, too. We recently ran an experiment where we took the 1,000 most popular NPM packages, installed and let AI loose, to try to run them in Cloudflare Workers, <a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/ralph/\"><u>Ralph Wiggum as a &quot;software engineer&quot;</u></a> style, and the results were surprisingly good. Excluding the packages that are build tools, CLI tools or browser-only and don’t apply, only 15 packages genuinely didn’t work. <b>That&#39;s 1.5%</b>.</p><p>Here’s a graphic of our Node.js API support over time:</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5GhwKJq2A2wG79I3NdhhDl/e462c30daf46b1b36d3f06bff479596b/image9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1802\" height=\"1194\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>We put together a page with the results of our internal experiment on npm packages support <a href=\"https://worksonworkers.southpolesteve.workers.dev/\"><u>here</u></a>, so you can check for yourself.</p><p>Moltbot doesn’t necessarily require a lot of Workers Node.js compatibility because most of the code runs in a container anyway, but we thought it would be important to highlight how far we got supporting so many packages using native APIs. This is because when starting a new AI agent application from scratch, we can actually run a lot of the logic in Workers, closer to the user.</p><p>The other important part of the story is that the list of <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/directory/?product-group=Developer+platform\"><u>products and APIs</u></a> on our Developer Platform has grown to the point where anyone can <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/solutions/hosting/\">build and run any kind of application</a> — even the most complex and demanding ones — on Cloudflare. And once launched, every application running on our Developer Platform immediately benefits from our secure and scalable global network.</p><p>Those products and services gave us the ingredients we needed to get started. First, we now have <a href=\"https://sandbox.cloudflare.com/\"><u>Sandboxes</u></a>, where you can run untrusted code securely in isolated environments, providing a place to run the service. Next, we now have <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/\"><u>Browser Rendering</u></a>, where you can programmatically control and interact with headless browser instances. And finally, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/\"><u>R2</u></a>, where you can store objects persistently. With those building blocks available, we could begin work on adapting Moltbot.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-we-adapted-moltbot-to-run-on-us\">How we adapted Moltbot to run on us</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-we-adapted-moltbot-to-run-on-us\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-start-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Moltbot on Workers, or Moltworker, is a combination of an entrypoint Worker that acts as an API router and a proxy between our APIs and the isolated environment, both protected by Cloudflare Access.

In this case you top up your account with credits and use AI Gateway with any of the supported providers directly, Cloudflare gets charged, and we will deduct credits from your account.</p><p>To make Moltbot use AI Gateway, first we create a new gateway instance, then we enable the Anthropic provider for it, then we either add our Claude key or purchase credits to use Unified Billing, and then all we need to do is set the ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL environment variable so Moltbot uses the AI Gateway endpoint.

This SDK is built on top of <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/\"><u>Cloudflare Containers</u></a>, but it provides a simple API for executing commands, managing files, running background processes, and exposing services — all from your Workers applications.</p><p>In short, instead of having to deal with the lower-level Container APIs, the Sandbox SDK gives you developer-friendly APIs for secure code execution and handles the complexity of container lifecycle, networking, file systems, and process management — letting you focus on building your application logic with just a few lines of TypeScript. Here’s an example:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-TypeScript\"><code class=\"language-TypeScript\">import { getSandbox } from &#039;@cloudflare/sandbox&#039;;\nexport { Sandbox } from &#039;@cloudflare/sandbox&#039;;\n\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise&lt;Response&gt; {\n    const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, &#039;user-123&#039;);\n\n    // Create a project structure\n    await sandbox.mkdir(&#039;/workspace/project/src&#039;, { recursive: true });\n\n    // Check node version\n    const version = await sandbox.exec(&#039;node -v&#039;);\n\n    // Run some python code\n    const ctx = await sandbox.createCodeContext({ language: &#039;python&#039; });\n    await sandbox.runCode(&#039;import math; radius = 5&#039;, { context: ctx });\n    const result = await sandbox.runCode(&#039;math.pi * radius ** 2&#039;, { context: ctx });\n\n    return Response.json({ version, result });\n  }\n};</pre></code>\n            <p>This fits like a glove for Moltbot. Instead of running Docker in your local Mac mini, we run Docker on Containers, use the Sandbox SDK to issue commands into the isolated environment and use callbacks to our entrypoint Worker, effectively establishing a two-way communication channel between the two systems.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"r2-for-persistent-storage\">R2 for persistent storage</h3>\n      <a href=\"#r2-for-persistent-storage\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-start-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The good thing about running things in your local computer or VPS is you get persistent storage for free.
