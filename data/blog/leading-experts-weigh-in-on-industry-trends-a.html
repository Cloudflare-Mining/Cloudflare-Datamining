	<p>Last month we attended Parallels Summit to meet with new and existing partners, and hear from leading experts on the latest industry trends. We had a great time giving limo rides to summit attendees and hosting "Conversations with CloudFlare" at our booth.</p>

Their conversations were captured live and offer insight into the latest trends and news in hosting and web services.</p>
