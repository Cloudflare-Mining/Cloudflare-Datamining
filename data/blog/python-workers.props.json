And just because “hello world” works doesn’t mean you can reliably build an application. Building full applications requires supporting an ecosystem of packages that developers are used to building with. For a platform to truly support a programming language, it’s necessary to go much further than showing how to compile code using external toolchains.</p><p>Python Workers are different from what we’ve done in the past.

If you’ve used Python before, this is almost certainly what you’ve used, and is commonly referred to as just “Python”.</p><p><a href=\"https://pyodide.org/en/stable/\">Pyodide</a> is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. It interprets Python code, without any need to precompile the Python code itself to any other format. It runs in a web browser — check out this <a href=\"https://pyodide-console.pages.dev/\">REPL</a>. It is true to the CPython that Python developers know and expect, providing <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/stdlib/\">most of the Python Standard Library</a>. It provides a foreign function interface (FFI) to JavaScript, allowing you to call JavaScript APIs directly from Python — more on this below. It provides popular open-source <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/packages/\">packages</a>, and can import pure Python packages directly from PyPI.</p><p>Pyodide struck us as the perfect fit for Workers. It is designed to allow the core interpreter and each native Python module to be built as separate WebAssembly modules, dynamically linked at runtime. This allows the code footprint for these modules to be shared among all Workers running on the same machine, rather than requiring each Worker to bring its own copy. This is essential to making WebAssembly work well in the Workers environment, where we often run <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/presentations/cloudflare-v8/\">thousands of Workers per machine</a> — we need Workers using the same programming language to share their runtime code footprint. Running thousands of Workers on every machine is what makes it possible for us to deploy every application in every location at a <a href=\"/workers-pricing-scale-to-zero\">reasonable price</a>.</p><p>Just like with JavaScript Workers, with Python Workers we provide the runtime for you:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4eCllqbVYDOzao6swhou7t/c4731707e15b9b37b4198f05a88682ee/VMs--Containers--ans-Isolates-comparison.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"798\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Pyodide is currently the exception — most languages that target WebAssembly do not yet support dynamic linking, so each application ends up bringing its own copy of its language runtime. We hope to see more languages support dynamic linking in the future, so that we can more effectively bring them to Workers.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-pyodide-works\">How Pyodide works</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-pyodide-works\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Pyodide executes Python code in WebAssembly, which is a sandboxed environment, separated from the host runtime.

Emscripten does this by <a href=\"https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Dynamic-Linking.html\">providing implementations of dlopen and dlsym,</a> which use the accompanying JavaScript library to modify the WebAssembly program’s table to link additional WebAssembly-compiled modules at runtime.

There is a risk in adding a second language that it might never reach feature parity with the first language and always be a second class citizen. Pyodide’s foreign function interface (FFI) is critical to avoiding this by providing access to all JavaScript functionality from Python. This can be used by the Worker author directly, and it is also used to make packages like <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/packages/fastapi/\">FastAPI</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/packages/langchain/\">Langchain</a> work out-of-the-box, as we’ll show later in this post.</p><p>An FFI is a system for calling functions in one language that are implemented in another language. In most cases, an FFI is defined by a &quot;higher-level&quot; language in order to call functions implemented in a systems language, often C. Python’s <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes\">ctypes module</a> is such a system. These sorts of foreign function interfaces are often difficult to use because of the nature of C APIs.</p><p>Pyodide’s foreign function interface is an interface between Python and JavaScript, which are two high level object-oriented languages with a lot of design similarities. When passed from one language to another, immutable types such as strings and numbers are transparently translated. All mutable objects are wrapped in an appropriate proxy.</p><p>When a JavaScript object is passed into Python, Pyodide determines which JavaScript protocols the object supports and <a href=\"https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/blob/main/src/core/jsproxy.c#L3781-L3791\">dynamically constructs</a> an appropriate Python class that implements the corresponding Python protocols.

These libraries are typically written in C, so they must first be compiled down to WebAssembly in order to work on the Workers runtime. As we noted above, Pyodide is built with Emscripten, which overrides Python’s C FFI — any time a package tries to load a native library, it is instead loaded from a WebAssembly module that is provided by the Workers runtime. Dynamic linking is what makes this possible — it is what lets us override Python’s C FFI, allowing Pyodide to support many <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/packages/\">Python packages</a> that have native library dependencies.</p><p>Dynamic linking is “pay as you go”, while static linking is “pay upfront” — if code is statically linked into your binary, it must be loaded upfront in order for the binary to run, even if this code is never used.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1JiF8v11hINyO6CpNnuP6a/52fad68dedc7a4d1c6beba46eb13f964/Python-Workers---Runtime.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"772\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Dynamic linking enables the Workers runtime to share the underlying WebAssembly modules of packages across different Workers that are running on the same machine.</p><p>We won’t go too much into detail on <a href=\"https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Dynamic-Linking.html#runtime-dynamic-linking-with-dlopen\">how dynamic linking works in Emscripten</a>, but the main takeaway is that the Emscripten runtime fetches WebAssembly modules from a filesystem abstraction provided in JavaScript. For each Worker, we generate a filesystem at runtime, whose structure mimics a Python distribution that has the Worker’s dependencies installed, but whose underlying files are shared between Workers. This makes it possible to share Python and WebAssembly files between multiple Workers that import the same dependency. Today, we’re able to share these files across Workers, but copy them into each new isolate. We think we can go even further, by employing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write\">copy-on-write</a> techniques to share the underlying resource across many Workers.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"supporting-server-and-client-libraries\">Supporting Server and Client libraries</h2>\n            <a href=\"#supporting-server-and-client-libraries\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Python has a wide variety of popular HTTP client libraries, including <a href=\"https://www.python-httpx.org/\">httpx</a>, <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/\">urllib3</a>, <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/requests/\">requests</a> and more.

How can we ensure that you can bring in the packages you need, while mitigating long cold start times?</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"making-cold-starts-faster-with-memory-snapshots\">Making cold starts faster with memory snapshots</h2>\n            <a href=\"#making-cold-starts-faster-with-memory-snapshots\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>In the example at the start of this post, in local development, we mentioned injecting Pyodide into your Worker. Pyodide itself is 6.4MB — and Python packages can also be quite large.</p><p>If we simply shoved Pyodide into your Worker and uploaded it to Cloudflare, that’d be quite a large Worker to load into a new isolate — cold starts would be slow. On a fast computer with a good network connection, Pyodide takes about two seconds to initialize in a web browser, one second of network time and one second of cpu time. It wouldn’t be acceptable to initialize it every time you update your code for every isolate your Worker runs in across <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">Cloudflare’s network</a>.</p><p>Instead, when you run <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy\">npx wrangler@latest deploy</a>, the following happens:</p><ol><li><p>Wrangler uploads your Python code and your <code>requirements.txt</code> file to the Workers API</p></li><li><p>We send your Python code, and your <code>requirements.txt</code> file to the Workers runtime to be validated</p></li><li><p>We create a new isolate for your Worker, and automatically inject Pyodide plus any <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/packages/\">packages</a> you’ve specified in your <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</p></li><li><p>We scan the Worker’s code for import statements, execute them, and then take a snapshot of the Worker’s WebAssembly linear memory. Effectively, we perform the expensive work of importing packages at deploy time, rather than at runtime.</p></li><li><p>We deploy this snapshot alongside your Worker’s Python code to Cloudflare’s network.</p></li><li><p>Just like a JavaScript Worker, we execute the Worker’s <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-startup-time\">top-level scope</a>.</p></li></ol><p>When a request comes in to your Worker, we load this snapshot and use it to bootstrap your Worker in an isolate, avoiding expensive initialization time:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2q0ztvdb60NUqlAsOWWFX4/203e421e31e25c5794f5fada1ad94c40/apipyth.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"475\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This takes cold starts for a basic Python Worker down to below 1 second.

This snapshot is specific to your Worker. It can’t be shared, even though most of its contents are the same as other Python Workers.</p><p>Instead, we can create a single, shared snapshot ahead of time, and preload it into a pool of “pre-warmed” isolates. These isolates would already have the Pyodide runtime loaded and ready — making a Python Worker work just like a JavaScript Worker. In both cases, the underlying interpreter and execution environment is provided by the Workers runtime, and available on-demand without delay. The only difference is that with Python, the interpreter runs in WebAssembly, within the Worker.</p><p>Snapshots are a common pattern across runtimes and execution environments. Node.js <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YEIBdH7ocJfm6PWISKw03szNAgnstA2B3e8PZr_-Gp4/edit#heading=h.1v0pvnoifuah\">uses V8 snapshots to speed up startup time</a>. You can take <a href=\"https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/main/docs/snapshotting/snapshot-support.md\">snapshots of Firecracker microVMs</a> and resume execution in a different process. There’s lots more we can do here — not just for Python Workers, but for Workers written in JavaScript as well, caching snapshots of compiled code from top-level scope and the state of the isolate itself. Workers are so fast and efficient that to-date we haven’t had to take snapshots in this way, but we think there are still big performance gains to be had.</p><p>This is our biggest lever towards driving cold start times down over the rest of 2024.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"future-proofing-compatibility-with-pyodide-versions-and-compatibility-dates\">Future proofing compatibility with Pyodide versions and Compatibility Dates</h2>\n            <a href=\"#future-proofing-compatibility-with-pyodide-versions-and-compatibility-dates\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>When you deploy a Worker to Cloudflare, you expect it to keep running indefinitely, even if you never update it again. There are Workers deployed in 2018 that are still running just fine in production.</p><p>We achieve this using <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/\">Compatibility Dates</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#compatibility-flags\">Compatibility Flags</a>, which provide explicit opt-in mechanisms for new behavior and potentially backwards-incompatible changes, without impacting existing Workers.</p><p>This works in part because it mirrors how the Internet and web browsers work. You publish a web page with some JavaScript, and rightly expect it to work forever. Web browsers and Cloudflare Workers have the same type of commitment of stability to developers.</p><p>There is a challenge with Python though — both Pyodide and CPython are <a href=\"https://devguide.python.org/versions/\">versioned</a>. Updated versions are published regularly and can contain breaking changes. And Pyodide provides a set of <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/packages/\">built-in packages</a>, each with a pinned version number. This presents a question — how should we allow you to update your Worker to a newer version of Pyodide?</p><p>The answer is <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/\">Compatibility Dates</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#compatibility-flags\">Compatibility Flags</a>.</p><p>A new version of Python is released every year in August, and a new version of Pyodide is released six (6) months later. When this new version of Pyodide is published, we will add it to Workers by gating it behind a Compatibility Flag, which is only enabled after a specified Compatibility Date. This lets us continually provide updates, without risk of breaking changes, extending the commitment we’ve made for JavaScript to Python.</p><p>Each Python release has a <a href=\"https://devguide.python.org/versions/\">five (5) year support window</a>. Once this support window has passed for a given version of Python, security patches are no longer applied, making this version unsafe to rely on. To mitigate this risk, while still trying to hold as true as possible to our commitment of stability and long-term support, after five years any Python Worker still on a Python release that is outside of the support window will be automatically moved forward to the next oldest Python release. Python is a mature and stable language, so we expect that in most cases, your Python Worker will continue running without issue. But we recommend updating the compatibility date of your Worker regularly, to stay within the support window.</p><p>In between Python releases, we also expect to update and add additional <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/packages/%5C\">Python packages</a>, using the same opt-in mechanism. A Compatibility Flag will be a combination of the Python version and the release date of a set of packages. For example, <b>python_3.17_packages_2025_03_01</b>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"how-bindings-work-in-python-workers\">How bindings work in Python Workers</h2>\n            <a href=\"#how-bindings-work-in-python-workers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>We mentioned earlier that Pyodide provides a foreign function interface (FFI) to JavaScript — meaning that you can directly use JavaScript objects, methods, functions and more, directly from Python.</p><p>This means that from day one, all <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/bindings/\">binding</a> APIs to other Cloudflare resources are supported in Cloudflare Workers.

We know — and we have actually tackled this challenge before for another language (<a href=\"/workers-rust-sdk\">Rust</a>). And we think we can do this even better for Python.</p><p>We launched <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs\">workers-rs</a> in 2021 to make it possible to write Workers in <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a>. For each JavaScript API in Workers, we, alongside open-source contributors, have written bindings that expose a more idiomatic Rust API.</p><p>We plan to do the same for Python Workers — starting with the bindings to <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/\">Workers AI</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/\">Vectorize</a>. But while workers-rs requires that you use and update an external dependency, the APIs we provide with Python Workers will be built into the Workers runtime directly. Just update your compatibility date, and get the latest, most Pythonic APIs.</p><p>This is about more than just making bindings to resources on Cloudflare more Pythonic though — it’s about compatibility with the ecosystem.</p><p>Similar to how we <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs/pull/477\">recently converted</a> workers-rs to use types from the <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/http\">http</a> crate, which makes it easy to use the <a href=\"https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/\">axum</a> crate for routing, we aim to do the same for Python Workers. For example, the Python standard library provides a <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html\">raw socket API</a>, which many Python packages depend on. Workers already provides <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/\">connect()</a>, a JavaScript API for working with raw sockets. We see ways to provide at least a subset of the Python standard library’s socket API in Workers, enabling a broader set of Python packages to work on Workers, with less of a need for patches.</p><p>But ultimately, we hope to kick start an effort to create a standardized serverless API for Python. One that is easy to use for any Python developer and offers the same capabilities as JavaScript.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"were-just-getting-started-with-python-workers\">We’re just getting started with Python Workers</h2>\n            <a href=\"#were-just-getting-started-with-python-workers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Providing true support for a new programming language is a big investment that goes far beyond making “hello world” work.
