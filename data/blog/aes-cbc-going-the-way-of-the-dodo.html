	<p>A little over a year ago, Nick Sullivan <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/padding-oracles-and-the-decline-of-cbc-mode-ciphersuites/">talked about</a> the beginning of the end for AES-CBC cipher suites, following a plethora of attacks on this cipher mode.</p>
	<p>Today we can safely confirm that this prediction is coming true, as for the first time ever the share of AES-CBC cipher suites on Cloudflare’s edge network dropped below that of <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/it-takes-two-to-chacha-poly/">ChaCha20-Poly1305</a> suites, and is fast approaching the 10% mark.</p>

	<p>Over the course of the last six months, AES-CBC shed more than 33% of its “market” share, dropping from 20% to just 13.4%.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2017/04/cipher-ms.png" alt="Ciphers"></p>
	<p>All of that share, went to AES-GCM, that currently encrypts over 71.2% of all connections. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/it-takes-two-to-chacha-poly/">ChaCha20-Poly1305</a> is stable, with 15.3% of all connections opting for that cipher. Surprisingly 3DES is still around, with 0.1% of the connections.</p>
	<p>The internal AES-CBC cipher suite breakdown as follows:</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2017/04/CBC.png" alt="CBC"></p>
	<p>The majority of AES-CBC connections use ECDHE-RSA or RSA key exchange, and not ECDHE-ECDSA, which implies that we mostly deal with older clients.</p>
	<h3 id="rsaisalsodying">RSA is also dying</h3>
	<p>In other good new, the use of <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/">ECDSA</a> surpassed that of RSA at the beginning of the year. Currently more than 60% of all connections use the ECDSA signature.</p>
	<p>Although 2048-bit RSA is not broken, it is generally considered less secure than 256-bit ECDSA, and is significantly slower to boot.</p>

	<h3 id="pfsisking">PFS is king</h3>
	<p>Last, but not least, 98.4% of all connections are PFS, using ECDHE for key exchange. That's up from 97.6% six months ago.</p>
	<p>All in all we see the continuation of the positive trend on the web towards safer and faster cryptography. We believe this trend will continue with the finalization of <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-tls-1-3/">TLS 1.3</a> later this year.</p>
