	<p>Cloudflare Workers Beta is now open!</p>
	<p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers">Cloudflare Workers</a> lets you run JavaScript on Cloudflare’s edge, deploying globally to over 120+ data centers around the world in less than 30 seconds. Your code can intercept and modify any request made to your website, make outbound requests to any URL on the Internet, and replace much of what you might need to configure your CDN to do today. Even better, it will do this from all our edge locations around the world, closer to many of your users than your origin servers can ever be. You will have a fully functional Turing-complete language in your fingertips which will allow you to build powerful applications on the edge. The only limit is your imagination.</p>
