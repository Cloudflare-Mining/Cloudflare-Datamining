Various complexities prevent websites from migrating from HTTP to HTTPS, including mixed content, which can prevent sites from functioning with HTTPS.</p><p>Opportunistic Encryption provides an additional level of security to websites that have not yet moved to HTTPS and the performance benefits of HTTP/2. Users will not see a security indicator for HTTPS in the address bar when visiting a site using Opportunistic Encryption, but the connection from the browser to the server is encrypted.</p><p>In December 2015, CloudFlare introduced <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/http2/\">HTTP/2</a>, the latest version of HTTP, that can result in improved performance for websites. HTTP/2 can’t be used without encryption, and before now, that meant HTTPS. Opportunistic Encryption, based on an <a href=\"http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-encryption.html\">IETF draft</a>, enables servers to accept HTTP requests over an encrypted connection, allowing HTTP/2 connections for non-HTTPS sites.

When a supporting browser makes a request to a CloudFlare site with Opportunistic Encryption enabled, CloudFlare adds an Alternative Service header to indicate that the site is available over HTTP/2 (or SPDY) on port 443.</p><p>For customers with HTTP/2 enabled:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">Alt-Svc: h2=”:443”; ma=60</pre></code>\n            <p>For customers with HTTP/2 disabled:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">Alt-Svc: spdy/3.1=”:443”; ma=60</pre></code>\n            <p>This header simply states that the domain can be authoritatively accessed using HTTP/2 (“h2”) or SPDY 3.1 (“spdy/3.1”) at the same network address, over port 443 (the standard HTTPS port).

For any subsequent HTTP requests to that domain, the browser will connect using TLS on port 443, where the server will present a certificate for the domain signed by a trusted certificate authority. The browser will then validate the certificate. If the connection succeeds, the browser will send the requests over that connection using HTTP/2.</p><p>Opportunistically requests will contain “http” in the<a href=\"https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#HttpRequest\"><code>:scheme</code> pseudo-header</a> instead of “https”. From a bit-on-the-wire perspective, this pseudo-header is the only difference between HTTP requests with Opportunistic Encryption over TLS and HTTPS. However, there is a big difference between how browsers treat assets fetched using HTTP vs. HTTPS URLs (as discussed below). </p><p>HTTP Alternative Services is a relatively new but widely used mechanism. For example, Alt-Svc is used by Google to advertise support for their experimental transport protocol, <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/quic\">QUIC</a>, to browsers in much the same way as we use it to advertise support for Opportunistic Encryption.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"why-not-just-use-https\">Why not just use HTTPS?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#why-not-just-use-https\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>CloudFlare enables HTTPS by default for customers on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/\">all plans</a> using Universal SSL.

Both websites and browsers were rudimentary compared to the today’s web ecosystem. The concept of web security was practically non-existent.</p><p>From <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html\">the original 1989 paper</a>:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2HwLp3ipQLBPQrABrqkM2/35384da5c3bdc5791949e85c1e5cb50c/Screen-Shot-2016-09-21-at-16.47.03.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"671\" height=\"189\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As the use cases of the web expanded to include sensitive data transactions, some security was needed. Multiple encryption schemes were developed to help secure HTTP, including <a href=\"http://www.homeport.org/~adam/shttp.html\">S-HTTP</a> and the eventual winner, HTTPS.</p><p>Originally, the difference between HTTP and HTTPS was one of layering. In HTTP, messages were written to the network directly, and in HTTPS, a secure connection was established between the client and server using SSL (an encryption and authentication protocol), and standard HTTP messages were written to the encrypted connection. Browsers signaled HTTP websites with an open lock icon, whereas HTTPS websites received a closed lock. Later, SSL evolved into TLS, although people sometimes <a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=ssl,tls,https\">still refer to it as SSL</a>.</p><p>As websites became much more complex, embedded scripts and dynamic content became commonplace. Serving insecure content on a secure web page was identified as a risk and HTTPS started to take on a more nuanced meaning. Rather than just HTTP on an encrypted connection, HTTPS meant secure HTTP. For example, cookies became a popular way to store state in the client for managing web sessions. Cookies obtained over a secure connection were not allowed to be sent over insecure HTTP or modified by data obtained over HTTP. New privacy-sensitive features now require HTTPS (such as the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/04/geolocation-on-secure-contexts-only\">Location API</a>). This distinction between HTTP and HTTPS has been further codified by the W3C, the standards body in charge of the web, in their <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/\">Secure Contexts</a> document.</p><p>To break it down:</p><ul><li><p>HTTP is a protocol for transferring hypertext</p></li><li><p>TLS/SSL is a protocol for encrypted communication</p></li><li><p>HTTPS is a protocol for transferring secure hypertext</p></li></ul><table><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p><b>HTTP</b></p></td><td><p><b>HTTPS</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Unencrypted</p></td><td><p><b>✔️</b></p></td><td><p>❌</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Encrypted with TLS</p></td><td><p>✔️</p></td><td><p>✔️</p></td></tr></table><p>Opportunistic Encryption is the bottom left ✔️.
