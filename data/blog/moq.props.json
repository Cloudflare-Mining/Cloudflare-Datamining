MoQ combines the low-latency interactivity of WebRTC, the scalability of HLS/DASH, and the simplicity of a single architecture, all built on a modern transport layer.

It solved the frustrating &quot;download and wait&quot; experience of early video playback on the web by creating a persistent, stateful TCP connection between a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash\"><u>Flash</u></a> client and a server. This enabled low-latency streaming (2-5 seconds), powering the first wave of live platforms like <a href=\"http://justin.tv\"><u>Justin.tv</u></a> (which later became Twitch).</p><p>But its strength was its weakness. That stateful connection, which had to be maintained for every viewer, was architecturally hostile to scale. It required expensive, specialized media servers and couldn&#39;t use the commodity HTTP-based <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/\"><u>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</u></a> that were beginning to power the rest of the web. Its reliance on TCP also meant that a single lost packet could freeze the entire stream—a phenomenon known as <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-road-to-quic/#head-of-line-blocking\"><u>head-of-line blocking</u></a>—creating jarring latency spikes. The industry retained RTMP for the &quot;first mile&quot; from the camera to servers (ingest), but a new solution was needed for the &quot;last mile&quot; from servers to your screen (delivery).</p><p><b>The HLS &amp; DASH era: Solving for scale, compromising on latency</b></p><p>The catalyst for the next era was the iPhone&#39;s rejection of Flash. In response, Apple created <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/video/what-is-http-live-streaming/\"><b><u>HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)</u></b></a>. HLS, and its open-standard counterpart <b>MPEG-DASH</b> abandoned stateful connections and treated video as a sequence of small, static files delivered over standard HTTP.</p><p>This enabled much greater scalability. By moving to the interoperable open standard of HTTP for the underlying transport, video could now be distributed by any web server and cached by global CDNs, allowing platforms to reach millions of viewers reliably and relatively inexpensively. The compromise? A <i>significant</i> trade-off in latency. To ensure smooth playback, players needed to buffer at least three video segments before starting. With segment durations of 6-10 seconds, this baked 15-30 seconds of latency directly into the architecture.</p><p>While extensions like <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming/enabling-low-latency-http-live-streaming-hls\"><u>Low-Latency HLS (LL-HLS)</u></a> have more recently emerged to achieve latencies in the 3-second range, they remain complex patches<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-road-to-quic/#head-of-line-blocking\"><u> fighting against the protocol&#39;s fundamental design</u></a>. These extensions introduce a layer of stateful, real-time communication—using clever workarounds like holding playlist requests open—that ultimately strain the stateless request-response model central to HTTP&#39;s scalability and composability.</p><p><b>The WebRTC Era: Conquering conversational latency, compromising on architecture</b></p><p>In parallel, <b>WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)</b> emerged to solve a different problem: plugin-free, two-way conversational video with sub-500ms latency within a browser. It worked by creating direct peer-to-peer (P2P) media paths, removing central servers from the equation.</p><p>But this P2P model is fundamentally at odds with broadcast scale. <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-calls-anycast-webrtc/#webrtc-growing-pains\"><u>In a mesh network, the number of connections grows quadratically with each new participant</u></a> (the &quot;N-squared problem&quot;). For more than a handful of users, the model collapses under the weight of its own complexity. To work around this, the industry developed server-based topologies like the Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) and Multipoint Control Unit (MCU). These are effective but require building what is essentially a <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-calls-anycast-webrtc/#is-cloudflare-calls-a-real-sfu\"><u>private, stateful, real-time CDN</u></a>—a complex and expensive undertaking that is not standardized across infrastructure providers.</p><p>This journey has left us with a fragmented landscape of specialized, non-interoperable silos, forcing developers to stitch together multiple protocols and accept a painful three-way tension between <b>latency, scale, and complexity</b>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"introducing-moq\"><b>Introducing MoQ</b></h3>\n      <a href=\"#introducing-moq\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>This is the context into which Media over QUIC (MoQ) emerges.

MoQT can run directly over raw <b>QUIC</b>, which is ideal for native applications, or over <b>WebTransport</b>, which is required for use in a web browser. Crucially, the<a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-webtrans-http3-02.html\"> <u>WebTransport protocol</u></a> and its corresponding<a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/webtransport/\"> <u>W3C browser API</u></a> make QUIC&#39;s multiplexed reliable streams and unreliable datagrams directly accessible to browser applications. This is a game-changer. Protocols like <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/stream-now-supports-srt-as-a-drop-in-replacement-for-rtmp/\"><u>SRT</u></a> may be efficient, but their lack of native browser support relegates them to ingest-only roles. WebTransport gives MoQ first-class citizenship on the web, making it suitable for both ingest and massive-scale distribution directly to clients.</p></li><li><p><b>The MoQT Layer:</b> Sitting on top of QUIC (or WebTransport), the MoQT layer provides the signaling and structure for a publish-subscribe system. This is the primary focus of the IETF working group. It defines the core control messages—like ANNOUNCE, and SUBSCRIBE—and the basic data model we just covered. MoQT itself is intentionally spartan; it doesn&#39;t know or care if the data it&#39;s moving is <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/video/what-is-h264-avc/\"><u>H.264</u></a> video, Opus audio, or game state updates.</p></li><li><p><b>The Streaming Format Layer:</b> This is where media-specific logic lives. A streaming format defines things like manifests, codec metadata, and packaging rules.\n <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-moq-warp/\"><b><u>WARP</u></b></a> is one such format being developed alongside MoQT at the IETF, but it isn&#39;t the only one. Another standards body, like DASH-IF, could define a <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/85623.html\"><u>CMAF</u></a>-based streaming format over MoQT. A company that controls both original publisher and end subscriber can develop its own proprietary streaming format to experiment with new codecs or delivery mechanisms without being constrained by the transport protocol.</p></li></ol><p>This separation of layers is why different organizations can build interoperable implementations while still innovating at the streaming format layer.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"end-to-end-data-flow\">End-to-End Data Flow</h4>\n      <a href=\"#end-to-end-data-flow\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Now that we understand the architecture and the data model, let&#39;s walk through how these pieces come together to deliver a stream. The protocol is flexible, but a typical broadcast flow relies on the <code>ANNOUNCE</code> and <code>SUBSCRIBE </code>messages to establish a data path from a publisher to a subscriber through the relay network.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2iRTJFdtCjIOcyg7ezoYgJ/e303ea8d1eb438328b60fdb28be47e84/image2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1808\" height=\"1791\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in this flow:</p><ol><li><p><b>Initiating Connections:</b> The process begins when the endpoints, acting as clients, connect to the relay network. The Original Publisher initiates a connection with its nearest relay (we&#39;ll call it Relay A). Separately, an End Subscriber initiates a connection with its own local relay (Relay B). These endpoints perform a <code>SETUP</code> handshake with their respective relays to establish a MoQ session and declare supported parameters.</p></li><li><p><b>Announcing a Namespace:</b> To make its content discoverable, the Publisher sends an <code>ANNOUNCE</code> message to Relay A. This message declares that the publisher is the authoritative source for a given <b>track namespace</b>. Relay A receives this and registers in a shared control plane (a conceptual database) that it is now a source for this namespace within the network.</p></li><li><p><b>Subscribing to a Track:</b> When the End Subscriber wants to receive media, it sends a <code>SUBSCRIBE</code> message to its relay, Relay B. This message is a request for a specific <b>track name</b> within a specific <b>track namespace</b>.</p></li><li><p><b>Connecting the Relays:</b> Relay B receives the <code>SUBSCRIBE</code> request and queries the control plane. It looks up the requested namespace and discovers that Relay A is the source. Relay B then initiates a session with Relay A (if it doesn&#39;t already have one) and forwards the <code>SUBSCRIBE</code> request upstream.</p></li><li><p><b>Completing the Path and Forwarding Objects:</b> Relay A, having received the subscription request from Relay B, forwards it to the Original Publisher. With the full path now established, the Publisher begins sending the <code>Objects</code> for the requested track. The Objects flow from the Publisher to Relay A, which forwards them to Relay B, which in turn forwards them to the End Subscriber. If another subscriber connects to Relay B and requests the same track, Relay B can immediately start sending them the Objects without needing to create a new upstream subscription.</p></li></ol>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h5 id=\"an-alternative-flow-the-publish-model\">An Alternative Flow: The <code>PUBLISH</code> Model</h5>\n      <a href=\"#an-alternative-flow-the-publish-model\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6KJYU1eWNyuSZEHNYonDDn/3898003d5a7f5904787c7ef009b22fe0/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1686\" height=\"1921\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>More recent drafts of the MoQ specification have introduced an alternative, push-based model using a <code>PUBLISH</code> message.

The publisher sends a <code>PUBLISH</code> message, and the relay&#39;s <code>PUBLISH_OK</code> response indicates whether it will accept the objects. This is particularly useful for ingest scenarios, where a publisher wants to send its stream to an entry point in the network immediately, ensuring the media is available the instant the first subscriber connects.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"advanced-capabilities-prioritization-and-congestion-control\">Advanced capabilities: Prioritization and congestion control</h4>\n      <a href=\"#advanced-capabilities-prioritization-and-congestion-control\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>MoQ’s benefits really shine when networks get congested. MoQ includes mechanisms for handling the reality of network traffic. One such mechanism is Subgroups.</p><p><b>Subgroups</b> are subdivisions within a Group that effectively map directly to the underlying QUIC streams. All Objects within the same Subgroup are generally sent on the same QUIC stream, guaranteeing their delivery order. Subgroup numbering also presents an opportunity to encode prioritization: within a Group, lower-numbered Subgroups are considered higher priority. </p><p>This enables intelligent quality degradation, especially with layered codecs (e.g. SVC):</p><ul><li><p><b>Subgroup 0</b>: Base video layer (360p) - must deliver</p></li><li><p><b>Subgroup 1</b>: Enhancement to 720p - deliver if bandwidth allows</p></li><li><p><b>Subgroup 2</b>: Enhancement to 1080p - first to drop under congestion</p></li></ul><p>When a relay detects congestion, it can drop Objects from higher-numbered Subgroups, preserving the base layer. Viewers see reduced quality instead of buffering.</p><p>The MoQ specification defines a scheduling algorithm that determines the order for all objects that are &quot;ready to send.&quot; When a relay has multiple objects ready, it prioritizes them first by <b>group order</b> (ascending or descending) and then, within a group, by <b>subgroup id</b>. Our implementation supports the <b>group order</b> preference, which can be useful for low-latency broadcasts. If a viewer falls behind and its subscription uses descending group order, the relay prioritizes sending Objects from the newest &quot;live&quot; Group, potentially canceling unsent Objects from older Groups. This can help viewers catch up to the live edge quickly, a highly desirable feature for many interactive streaming use cases. The optimal strategies for using these features to improve QoE for specific use cases are still an open research question. We invite developers and researchers to use our network to experiment and help find the answers.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"implementation-building-the-cloudflare-moq-relay\"><b>Implementation: building the Cloudflare MoQ relay</b></h3>\n      <a href=\"#implementation-building-the-cloudflare-moq-relay\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Theory is one thing; implementation is another.

In our deep dive, we mentioned that when a publisher <code>ANNOUNCE</code>s a namespace, relays need to register this availability in a &quot;shared control plane&quot; so that <code>SUBSCRIBE</code> requests can be routed correctly. For this critical piece of state management, we use <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/\"><u>Durable Objects</u></a>.</p><p>When a publisher announces a new namespace to a relay in, say, London, that relay uses a Durable Object—our strongly consistent, single-threaded storage solution—to record that this namespace is now available at that specific location. When a subscriber in Paris wants a track from that namespace, the network can query this distributed state to find the nearest source and route the <code>SUBSCRIBE</code> request accordingly. This architecture builds upon the technology we developed for Cloudflare&#39;s real-time services and provides a solution to the challenge of state management at a global scale.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"an-evolving-specification\">An Evolving Specification</h4>\n      <a href=\"#an-evolving-specification\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Building on a new protocol in the open means implementing against a moving target.

To make that possible MoQ at Cloudflare is in tech preview - this means it&#39;s available free of charge for testing (at any scale). Visit our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/moq/\"><u>developer homepage </u></a>for updates and potential breaking changes.</p><p>Indie developers and large enterprises alike ask about pricing early in their adoption of new technologies. We will be transparent and clear about MoQ pricing. In general availability, self-serve customers should expect to pay 5 cents/GB outbound with no cost for traffic sent towards Cloudflare. </p><p>Enterprise customers can expect usual pricing in line with regular media delivery pricing, competitive with incumbent protocols. This means if you’re already using Cloudflare for media delivery, you should not be wary of adopting new technologies because of cost. We will support you.</p><p>If you’re interested in partnering with Cloudflare in adopting the protocol early or contributing to its development, please reach out to us at <a href=\"mailto:moq@cloudflare.com\"><u>moq@cloudflare.com</u></a>!
