	<p>As a fellow startup, it's been really painful to watch the challenges
		Tumblr has gone though over the last 24 hours. With any sufficiently
		complex system, it is inevitable that unexpected problems will arise. It
		looks like Tumblr is getting back on their feet, but nothing feels worse
		than downtime.</p>
	<p>That's why one of my favorite CloudFlare features is "Always Online."
		Think of it like insurance for your website. We use the natural pattern
		of search engine crawlers to build a cached copy of your site. If, for
		any reason, your web host or service provider goes down, we kick in to
		keep your site online. We can't perform magic and make a dynamic site
		fully functional when its backend is down, so things like shopping carts
		and other web applications will still cause an error. However, your
		basic content will stay up so your visitors can still find you and
		search engines will keep indexing you.</p>
	<p>Some of my favorite messages to get from customers read like the
		following:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<br<<p>Just wanted to let your team know how Cloudflare has saved our sales
			... Our site was offline most of the afternoon due too many
			connections trying to connect at once ... but since our site was
			cached through CloudFlare's Always Online service it stayed available
			and customers still made it to us. If it was not for CloudFlare we
			would have missed sales. Thank you CloudFlare for keeping our business
			online and our sales coming when even our site is down!<p></p>
		</br<<p>
	</blockquote>
	<br>
	<p>That's pretty cool.</p>
	<p>While anyone with their own domain can sign up for CloudFlare today,
		we're talking with several platform providers to bring the insurance of
		Always Online, and the other benefits CloudFlare offers, to even more
		sites. Our goal is simple: to make outages like the one Tumblr just
		lived through a thing of the past.</p>
