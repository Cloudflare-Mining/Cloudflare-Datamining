I also noticed the diversity in the names of many of the blog post authors.</p><p>There are over 50 languages spoken at Cloudflare, as we have natives from many countries on our team, with different backgrounds, religions, gender and cultures. And it is this diversity that makes us a great team.</p><p>A few days ago I asked one of my colleagues how he would say &quot;Happy Holidays!&quot; in Arabic. When I heard him say it, I instantly got the idea of recording a video in as many languages as possible of our colleagues wishing all of you, our readers and customers, a happy winter season.</p><p>It only took one internal message for people to start responding and sending their videos to me. Some did it themselves, others flocked in a meeting room and helped each other record their greeting. It took a few days and some video editing to put together an informal video that was entirely done by the team, to wish you all the best as we close this year and decade.</p><p>So here it is: Happy Holidays from all of us at Cloudflare!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://customer-eq7kiuol0tk9chox.cloudflarestream.com/36d104df152f1d37d04a856861eb29ef/iframe?preload=true&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fcustomer-eq7kiuol0tk9chox.cloudflarestream.com%2F36d104df152f1d37d04a856861eb29ef%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D46s%26height%3D600\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\" allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Let us know if you speak any of the languages in the video.
