Cloudflare IPsec simplifies configuration and provides high availability; if a specific data center becomes unavailable, traffic is automatically rerouted to the closest healthy data center.

Organizations that haven&#39;t begun their migration risk being out of compliance and vulnerable as the deadline nears.</p><p><b>Upgrades have historically been tricky. </b>While 2030 might seem far away, upgrading cryptographic algorithms is notoriously difficult. History has shown us that depreciating cryptography can take decades: we found examples of <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/radius-udp-vulnerable-md5-attack/\"><u>MD5 causing problems 20 years after it was deprecated</u></a>. This lack of crypto agility — the ability to easily swap out cryptographic algorithms — is a major bottleneck.

The industry has largely converged on ML-KEM (Module-Lattice-based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism) as the standard PQ key agreement protocol. </p><p>ML-KEM has been widely adopted for use in <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/\"><u>TLS</u></a>, usually deployed alongside classical Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDHE), where the key used to encrypt network traffic is derived by mixing the outputs of the ML-KEM and ECDHE key agreements. (This is also known as “hybrid ML-KEM”). Well over <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption\"><u>60% of human-generated TLS traffic</u></a> to Cloudflare’s network is currently protected with hybrid ML-KEM. The transition to hybrid ML-KEM has been successful because it:</p><ul><li><p>stops &quot;harvest-now, decrypt-later&quot; attacks</p></li><li><p>does not require specialized hardware or specialized physical connectivity between client and server, unlike approaches like <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/you-dont-need-quantum-hardware/\"><u>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)</u></a></p></li><li><p>has <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/you-dont-need-quantum-hardware/\"><u>little impact on performance</u></a>, even for short-lived TLS connections</p></li></ul><p>Because ML-KEM runs in <i>parallel </i>with classical ECDHE, there is no reduction in security and compliance as compared to the classical ECDHE approach.  </p><p><b>Migration 2: Digital signatures. </b>Meanwhile, digital signatures and certificates protect authenticity, stopping active adversaries from impersonating the server to the client. Unfortunately, PQ signatures are currently larger in size than classical ECC algorithms, which has slowed their adoption. Fortunately, the migration to PQ signatures is less urgent, because PQ signatures are designed to stop active adversaries armed with powerful quantum computers, which are not known to exist yet. Thus, while Cloudflare is actively contributing to the standardization and rollout of PQ digital signatures, the current Cloudflare IPsec upgrade focuses on upgrading key establishment to hybrid ML-KEM.  </p><p>The U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recognized the nature of these two migrations in its <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/product-categories-technologies-use-post-quantum-cryptography-standards\"><u>January 2026 publication</u></a>, “Product Categories for Technologies That Use Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards.”</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"breaking-new-ground-with-ipsec\">Breaking new ground with IPsec </h2>\n      <a href=\"#breaking-new-ground-with-ipsec\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>To achieve a SASE fully protected with post-quantum encryption, we’ve upgraded our Cloudflare IPsec products to support hybrid ML-KEM in the IPsec protocol.</p><p>The IPsec community’s journey toward post-quantum cryptography has been very different from that of TLS. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/\"><u>TLS</u></a> is the de facto standard for encrypting public Internet traffic at Layer 4  — e.g. from a browser to a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/\"><u>content delivery network (CDN)</u></a> — so security and vendor interoperability are at the forefront of its design. Meanwhile, IPsec is a Layer 3 protocol that commonly connects devices built by the same vendor (e.g. two routers), so interoperability has historically been less of a concern.

RFC 8784 implies the use of either long-lived pre-shared keys (PSK) or quantum key distribution (QKD). Neither of these approaches are very palatable.</p><p>RFC 8784 proposes mixing a PSK with a key derived from Diffie Hellman Exchange (DHE), essentially running PSK in hybrid with DHE. This approach protects against harvest-now-decrypt-later attackers, but does not offer <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-on-top-of-tls-attacks/#forward-secrecy\"><u>forward secrecy</u></a> against quantum adversaries. </p><p><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-on-top-of-tls-attacks/#forward-secrecy\"><u>Forward secrecy</u></a> is a standard desideratum of key agreement protocols. It ensures that a system is secure even if the long-lived key is leaked. The PSK approach in RFC 8784 is vulnerable to an harvest-now-decrypt-later adversary that also obtains a copy of a long-lived PSK, and can then decrypt traffic in the future (by breaking the DHE key agreement) once powerful quantum computers become available.</p><p>To solve this forward secrecy issue, RFC 8784 can instead be used to mix the key from the classical DHE with a freshly generated key derived from a QKD protocol.</p><p>QKD uses quantum mechanics to establish a shared, secret cryptographic key between two parties. Importantly, for QKD to work, the parties must have specialized hardware or be connected by a dedicated physical connection. This is a <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/you-dont-need-quantum-hardware/\"><u>significant limitation</u></a>, rendering QKD useless for common Internet use cases like connecting a laptop to a distant server over Wi-Fi.

But unlike TLS, which only supports using post-quantum ML-KEM in parallel with classical DHE, this IPsec standard allows using up to <i>seven different key agreements to run at the same time</i> in parallel with classical Diffie Helman. Moreover, it doesn&#39;t specify details about what these key agreements should be, leaving it up to the vendors to choose their algorithms and implementations.
