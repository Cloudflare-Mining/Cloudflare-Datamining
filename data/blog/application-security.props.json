Throughout this post, we will refer to the following terms:</p><ul><li><p><b>Mitigated Traffic</b>: any eyeball HTTP***** request that had a “terminating” action applied to by the Cloudflare platform. These include actions such as <code>BLOCK</code>, <code>CHALLENGE</code> (such as captchas or JavaScript based challenges). This does not include requests that had the following actions applied: <code>LOG</code>, <code>SKIP</code>, <code>ALLOW</code>.</p></li><li><p><b>Bot Traffic/Automated Traffic</b>: any HTTP request identified by Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/\">Bot Management</a> system as being generated by a bot. This includes requests scored between <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/\">1 and 29</a>.</p></li><li><p><b>API Traffic</b>: any HTTP request with a response content type of <code>XML</code>, <code>JSON</code>, <code>gRPC</code>, or similar. Where the response content type is not available, such as for mitigated requests, the equivalent <code>Accept</code> content type (specified by the user agent) is used instead. In this latter case API traffic won’t be fully accounted for, but for insight purposes it still provides a good representation.</p></li></ul><p>Unless otherwise stated, the time frame evaluated in this post is the three-month period from December 1, 2021, to March 1, 2022.</p><p>Finally, please note that the data is calculated based only on traffic observed across the Cloudflare network and does not necessarily represent overall HTTP traffic patterns across the Internet.</p><p>*When referring to HTTP traffic we mean both HTTP and HTTPS.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"global-traffic-insights\">Global Traffic Insights</h2>\n            <a href=\"#global-traffic-insights\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>The first thing we can look at is traffic mitigated across all HTTP requests proxied by the Cloudflare network.

Cloudflare’s layer 7 DDoS rules are fully managed and don’t require user configuration: they automatically detect a vast array of HTTP DDoS attacks including those generated by the <a href=\"/meris-botnet/\">Meris botnet</a>, <a href=\"/cloudflare-blocks-an-almost-2-tbps-multi-vector-ddos-attack/\">Mirai botnet</a>, known attack tools, and others. Volumetric DDoS attacks, by definition, create a lot of malicious traffic!</p></li><li><p><b>Custom WAF Rules</b> contribute to more than 19% of mitigated HTTP traffic. These are user-configured rules defined using Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/\">wirefilter syntax</a>. We explore common rule patterns further down in this post.</p></li><li><p>Our <b>Rate Limiting</b> feature allows customers to define custom thresholds based on application preferences. It is often used as an additional layer of protection for applications against traffic patterns that are too low to be detected as a DDoS attack. Over the time frame analyzed, rate limiting contributed to 10.5% of mitigated HTTP requests.</p></li><li><p><b>IP Threat Reputation</b> is exposed in the Cloudflare dashboard as Security Level. Based on behavior we observe across the network, Cloudflare automatically assigns a threat score to each IP address. When the threat score is above the specified threshold, we challenge the traffic. This accounts for 2.5% of all mitigated HTTP requests.</p></li><li><p>Our <b>Managed WAF Rules</b> are rules that are handcrafted by our internal security analyst team aimed at matching only against valid malicious payloads. They contribute to about 1.5% of all mitigated requests.</p></li></ul>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"http-anomalies-are-the-most-common-attack-vector\">HTTP anomalies are the most common attack vector</h3>\n            <a href=\"#http-anomalies-are-the-most-common-attack-vector\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>If we drill into Managed WAF Rules, we get a clear picture of what type of attack vectors malicious users are attempting against the Internet properties we protect.</p><p>The vast majority (over 54%) of HTTP requests blocked by our Managed WAF Rules contain HTTP anomalies, such as malformed method names, null byte characters in headers, non-standard ports or content length of zero with a <code>POST</code> request.</p><p>Common attack types in this category are shown below. These have been grouped when relevant:</p><p>table { width: 100%; }</p><p>Rule Type</p><p>Description</p><p>Missing User Agent</p><p>These rules will block any request without a <code>User-Agent</code> header. All browsers and legitimate crawlers present this header when connecting to a site. Not having a user agent is a common signal of a malicious request.</p><p>Not <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code> or <code>HEAD</code> Method</p><p>Most applications only allow standard <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> requests (normally used for viewing pages or submitting forms). <code>HEAD</code> requests are also often sent from browsers for security purposes. Customers using our Managed Rules can easily block any other method - which normally results in blocking a large number of vulnerability scanners.</p><p>Missing Referer</p><p>When users navigate applications, browsers use the <code>Referer</code> header to indicate where they are coming from. Some applications expect this header to always be present.</p><p>Non-standard port</p><p>Customers can configure Cloudflare Managed Rules to block HTTP requests trying to access non-standard ports (such as 80 and 443). This is activity normally seen by vulnerability scanners.</p><p>Invalid UTF-8 encoding</p><p>It is common for attackers to attempt to break an application server by sending “special” characters that are not valid in UTF-8 encoding.</p><p>More commonly known and referenced attack vectors such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/cross-site-scripting/\">XSS</a> and SQLi only contribute to about 13% of total mitigated requests. More interestingly, attacks aimed at information disclosure are third most popular (10%) and software-specific CVE-based attacks account for about 12% of mitigated requests (more than SQLi alone) highlighting both the importance of needing to patch software quickly, and the likelihood of CVE proof-of-concepts (PoCs) being used to compromise applications, such as with the recent <a href=\"/tag/log4j/\">Log4J</a> vulnerability.

It’s a reminder that automation in and of itself is not necessarily detrimental to a site.  This is why we segment Verified Bot traffic, and why we give customers a granular bot score, rather than a binary “bot or not bot” indicator. Website operators want the flexibility to be precise with their response to different types of bot traffic, and we can see that they do in fact use this flexibility.

As noted above, automation does not necessarily mean these bots are performing malicious actions. If we look at customer responses to identified bot traffic, we find that 38.5% of HTTP requests from non-verified bots are mitigated.

We find that many enterprise customers choose to not immediately block bot traffic, so they don’t give a feedback signal to attackers. Rather, they prefer to tag and monitor this traffic, and either drop at a later time or redirect to alternate content. As targeted attack vectors have evolved, responses to those attacks have had to evolve and become more sophisticated as well. Additionally, nearly 3% of non-verified bot traffic is automatically mitigated by our DDoS protection (<code>connection_close</code>).
