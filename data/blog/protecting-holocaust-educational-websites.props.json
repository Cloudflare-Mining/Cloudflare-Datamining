The tipping point was a night of violence known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht\">Kristallnacht (&quot;Night of Broken Glass&quot;)</a>. Jews and other minority groups were outlawed, dehumanized, persecuted and killed. Jewish businesses were boycotted, Jewish books burned and synagogues destroyed. Jews, Roma and other “enemies of the Reich&#39;&#39; were forced into closed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_ghettos\">ghettos</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps\">concentration camps</a>. Finally, as part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution\">Final Solution for the Jewish Question</a>, Germany outlined a policy to deliberately and systematically exterminate the Jewish race in what came to be known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust\">Holocaust</a>.</p><p>As part of the Final Solution, the Nazis deployed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen\">mobile killing units</a>. Jews were taken to forests near their villages, forced to dig mass graves, undress, and then shot — falling into the mass graves they dug. This was the first step. However, this was “inefficient”. More “efficient” solutions were engineered using deadly gas. Eventually, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp\">six main extermination camps</a> were established. They were extremely “efficient” at exterminating humans. Initially, the Nazis experimented with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_van\">gas vans</a> for mass extermination. Later, they built and operated <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chamber\">gas chambers</a> which could kill more humans and do it faster. After being gassed, prisoners would load the bodies into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp#Crematorium_I,_first_gassings\">ovens in crematoriums</a> to be burned. In one of the larger death camps, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp#Auschwitz_II-Birkenau\">Auschwitz-Birkenau</a>, more than one million Jews were murdered — some 865,000 were gassed and burned on arrival.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"fighting-racism-with-education\">Fighting racism with education</h3>\n      <a href=\"#fighting-racism-with-education\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Seventy-seven years later, sadly, racism and antisemitism are once again on the rise and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/charles-michel-jewish-auschwitz-moshe-kantor-brussels-b2001332.html\">have gained traction across Europe during the pandemic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorrison/2022/01/26/pledge-to-tackle-campus-antisemitism-in-uk/\">across UK university campuses</a>.
