The concept breaks down into a few typical buckets:</p><ul><li><p><b>Zero Trust access control</b>: Protect applications that hold sensitive data by creating <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/principle-of-least-privilege/\">least privilege</a> rules that check for identity, device posture, and other signals on each and every request or connection.</p></li><li><p><b>Outbound filtering</b>: Keep people and devices safe as they connect to the rest of the Internet by filtering and logging network traffic, DNS queries, and HTTP requests.</p></li><li><p><b>Secure SaaS usage</b>: Analyze traffic to SaaS applications and scan the data sitting inside of SaaS applications for potential <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-shadow-it/\">Shadow IT policy violations</a>, misconfigurations, or data mishandling.</p></li><li><p><b>Data protection</b>: Scan for data leaving your organization towards destinations that do not comply with your organization’s policies. Find data stored inside your organization, even in trusted tools, that should not be retained or that needs tighter <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-access-control/\">access controls</a>.</p></li><li><p><b>Employee experience</b>: <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-digital-experience-monitoring/\">Monitor and improve the experience</a> that your team members have when using tools and applications on the Internet or hosted inside your own organization.</p></li></ul><p>The SSE space is a component of the larger <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/\"><u>Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)</u></a> market. You can think of the SSE capabilities as the security half of SASE, while the other half consists of the networking technologies that connect offices and data centers to each other along with everything that SSE connects. Some vendors only focus on the SSE side and rely on partners to connect customers to their security solutions. Other companies just provide the networking pieces. While today’s announcement highlights our SSE capabilities, Cloudflare offers both components as a unified SASE platform.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"how-does-cloudflare-fit-into-the-sse-space\">How does Cloudflare fit into the SSE space?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#how-does-cloudflare-fit-into-the-sse-space\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare’s global network was built for this. We’ve developed a unified, programmable <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network\"><u>network</u></a> in which every service runs in every data center, spanning more than 330 cities across the globe. Cloudflare operates within approximately 50 milliseconds of 95% of the Internet-connected population globally.

Modern organizations need solutions that:</p><ul><li><p>Provide visibility into unauthorized application usage that creates compliance and security risks</p></li><li><p>Enable granular control over data flows within both sanctioned and unsanctioned applications</p></li><li><p>Automate discovery and remediation of security misconfigurations in approved SaaS tools</p></li></ul><p>Any user in an enterprise now needs to connect to an application on the public Internet to do their work, and some users prefer to use their favorite application rather than the ones vetted and approved by the IT department. This kind of Shadow IT infrastructure can lead to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/the-net/shadow-it/\">surprise fees, compliance violations, and data loss</a>.</p><p>Cloudflare offers comprehensive scanning and filtering to detect when team members are using unapproved tools. With a single click, administrators can block those tools outright or control how those applications can be used. If your marketing team needs to use Google Drive to collaborate with a vendor, you can quickly apply a rule that makes sure they can only download files and never upload. Alternatively, you can allow users to visit an application and read from it while blocking all text input. Cloudflare&#39;s Shadow IT policies offer easy-to-deploy controls to help manage how your organization uses the Internet.</p><p>Beyond unsanctioned applications, even approved resources can cause trouble. Your organization might rely on Microsoft OneDrive for day-to-day work, but your compliance policies prohibit your HR department from storing files with employee Social Security numbers in the tool. Cloudflare&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-casb/\">Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) </a>can routinely scan the SaaS applications your team relies on to detect improper usage, missing controls, or potential misconfiguration.</p><p>By mid-2026, we look forward to bringing our customers a slew of new capabilities designed to give teams even better visibility and control over their SaaS and cloud applications, including:</p><ul><li><p><b>Robust remediation capabilities:</b> Resolve detected issues right from the dashboard, both automatically and on-demand with a single click.</p></li><li><p><b>Advanced workflows:</b> Configure automated behavior when new issues are detected, like custom alerting outputs and business justification prompts.</p></li><li><p><b>User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) &amp; suspicious activity monitoring:</b> Monitor live events across your SaaS apps and detect anomalous/suspicious activity that could indicate compromise.</p></li></ul>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"data-security\">Data security</h3>\n            <a href=\"#data-security\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Over the past year, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/cio/\">CIOs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ciso/\">CISOs</a> have consistently identified data protection as a top concern, particularly regarding artificial intelligence and large language models.

Cloudflare designed our capabilities with these needs in mind, because we deliver true convergence of both networking and security from our connectivity cloud.</p><p>Across the industry, we’ve seen many instances where vendors start with either networking or security as their primary focus, and acquire a vendor with an entirely different architecture to enter the SASE market. In such scenarios, there is no convergence with security and networking, because internal traffic is handled through different security controls than the cloud traffic. </p><p>Cloudflare delivers networking services using the same global data centers and backbone as our security components. Our composable architecture ensures all of our services are designed to work together, in any order. This means that your security and networking stays consistent and provides a common destination for your SASE journey, no matter where you start. </p><p>We’re proud of the work that we’ve done to solve customer problems.
