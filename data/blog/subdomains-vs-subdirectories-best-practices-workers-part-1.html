	<p>Alice and Bob are budding blogger buddies who met up at a meetup and purchased some <em>root domains </em>to start writing. &nbsp;Alice bought <em>aliceblogs.com</em> and Bob scooped up <em>bobtopia.com</em>.</p>
	<p>Alice and Bob decided against WordPress because its what their parents use and purchased subscriptions to a popular cloud-based Ghost blogging platform instead.</p>
	<p>Bob decides his blog should live at at blog.bobtopia.com – a <em>subdomain</em> of bobtopia.com. Alice keeps it old school and builds hers at <em>aliceblogs.com/blog</em> – a <em>subdirectory</em> of aliceblogs.com.</p>

	<p><em>Subdomains</em> and <em>subdirectories</em> are different strategies for instrumenting root domains with new features (think a blog or a storefront). &nbsp;Alice and Bob chose their strategies on a whim, but <em>which strategy is technically better</em>? &nbsp;The short answer is, <em>it depends</em>. But the long answer can actually improve your SEO. &nbsp;In this article, we'll review the merits and tradeoffs of each. In <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/subdomains-vs-subdirectories-improved-seo-part-2/">Part 2</a>, we'll show you how to convert subdomains to subdirectories using <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/subdomains-vs-subdirectories-best-practices-workers-part-1/www.cloudflare.com/workers">Cloudflare Workers</a>.</p>
	<h4 id="setting-up-subdomains-and-subdirectories">Setting Up Subdomains and Subdirectories</h4>
	<p>Setting up subdirectories is trivial on basic websites. &nbsp;A web server treats its subdirectories (aka subfolders) the same as regular old folders in a file system. &nbsp;In other words, basic sites are already organized using subdirectories out of the box. &nbsp;No set up or configuration is required.</p>
	<p></p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-22-at-4.07.02-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure>
	<p></p>
	<p>In the old school site above, we'll assume the <em>blog</em> folder contains an <em>index.html</em> file. The web server renders <em>blog/index.html</em> when a user navigates to the <em>oldschoolsite.com/blog </em>subdirectory<em>. &nbsp;</em>But Alice and Bob's sites don't have a <em>blog</em> folder because their blogs are hosted remotely – so this approach won't work.</p>
	<p>On the modern Internet, subdirectory setup is more complicated because the services that comprise a root domain are often hosted on machines scattered across the world.</p>
	<p>Because DNS records only operate on the domain level, records like <code>CNAME</code> have no effect on a url like <em>aliceblogs.com/blog</em> – and because her blog is hosted remotely, Alice needs to install <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank">NGINX</a> or another reverse proxy and write some configuration code that proxies traffic from <em>aliceblogs.com/blog</em> to her hosted blog. It takes time, patience, and experience to connect her domain to her hosted blog.</p>
	<p></p>

	</figure>
	<p></p>
	<p>Bob's subdomain strategy is the easier approach with his remotely hosted blog. &nbsp;A DNS <code>CNAME</code> record is often all that's required to connect Bob's blog to his subdomain. &nbsp;No additional configuration is needed if he can remember to pay his monthly subscription.</p>
	<p></p>

	<p></p>
	<p>To recap, subdirectories are already built into simple sites that serve structured content from the same machine, but modern sites often rely on various remote services. &nbsp;Subdomain set up is comparatively easy for sites that take advantage of various hosted cloud-based platforms.</p>
	<h4 id="are-subdomains-or-subdirectories-better-for-seo">Are Subdomains or Subdirectories Better for SEO?</h4>
	<p>Subdomains are neat. If you ask me, <em>blog.bobtopia.com</em> is more appealing than <em>bobtopia.com/blog</em>. But if we want to make an informed decision about the best strategy, where do we look? &nbsp;If we're interested in SEO, we ought to consult the Google Bot.</p>
	<p></p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uJGDyAN9g-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>
	<p></p>
	<p>Subdomains and subdirectories are equal in the eyes of the Google Bot, according to Google itself. &nbsp;This means that Alice and Bob have the same chance at ranking in search results. &nbsp;This is because Alice's root domain and Bob's subdomain build their own sets of <em>keywords</em>. &nbsp;Relevant keywords help your audience find your site in a search. There is one important caveat to point out for Bob:</p>
	<blockquote>A subdomain is equal and distinct from a root domain. &nbsp;This means that a subdomain's keywords are treated separately from the root domain.</blockquote>
	<p>What does this mean for Bob? &nbsp;Let's imagine <em>bobtopia.com</em> is already a popular online platform for folks named Bob to seek kinship with other Bobs. &nbsp;In this peculiar world, searches that rank for <em>bobtopia.com</em> wouldn't automatically rank for <em>blog.bobtopia.com</em> because each domain has its own separate keywords. &nbsp;The lesson here is that keywords are diluted across subdomains. &nbsp;Each additional subdomain decreases the likelihood that any particular domain ranks in a given search. &nbsp;A high ranking subdomain does not imply your root domain ranks well.</p>
	<p></p>

		<figcaption>In a search for "Cool Blog", <em>bobtopia.com</em> suffers from <em>keyword dilution.</em> It doesn't rank because its blog keyword is owned by <em>blog.bobtopia.com</em>.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p></p>
	<p>Subdomains also suffer from <em>backlink dilution.</em> &nbsp;A <em>backlink</em> is simply a hyperlink that points back to your site. Alice's attribution to a post on the etymology of Bob from <em>blog.bobtopia.com</em> does not help <em>bobtopia.com</em> because the subdomain is treated separate but equal from the root domain. &nbsp;If Bob used subdirectories instead, Bob's blog posts would feed the authority of <em>bobtopia.com</em> and Bobs everywhere would rejoice.</p>
	<p></p>

		<figcaption>The authority of <em>blog.bobtopia.com</em> is increased when Alice links to Bob's interesting blog post, but the authority of <em>bobtopia.com</em> is not affected.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p></p>
	<p>Although search engines have improved at identifying subdomains and attributing keywords back to the root domain, they still have a long way to go. &nbsp;A prudent marketer would avoid risk by assuming search engines will always be bad at cataloguing subdomains.</p>
	<p>So when would you want to use subdomains? &nbsp;A good use case is for companies who are interested in expanding into foreign markets. &nbsp;Pretend <em>bobtopia.com</em> is an American company whose website is in English. &nbsp;Their English keywords won't rank well in German searches – so they translate their site into German to begin building new keywords on <em>deutsch.bobtopia.com</em>. Erfolg!</p>
	<p>Other use cases for subdomains include product stratification (think global brands with presence across many markets) and corporate internal tools (think productivity and organization tools that aren't user facing). &nbsp;But unless you're a huge corporation or just finished your Series C round of funding, subdomaining your site into many silos is not helping your SEO.</p>
	<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
	<p>If you're a startup or small business looking to optimize your SEO, consider subdirectories over subdomains. &nbsp;Boosting the authority of your root domain should be a universal goal of any organization. The subdirectory strategy concentrates your keywords onto a single domain while the subdomain strategy spreads your keywords across multiple distinct domains. In a word, the subdirectory strategy results in better root domain authority. Higher domain authority leads to better search rankings which translates to more engagement.</p>
	<p>Consider the multitude of disruptive PaaS startups with <em>docs.disruptivepaas.com</em> and <em>blog.disruptivepaas.com</em>. &nbsp;Why not switch to <em>disruptivepaas.com/docs</em> and <em>disruptivepaas.com/blog</em> to boost the authority of your root domain with all those docs searches and StackOverflow backlinks?</p>
