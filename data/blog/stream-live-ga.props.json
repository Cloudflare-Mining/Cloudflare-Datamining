Stream Live is a feature of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/\">Cloudflare Stream</a> that allows developers to build live video features in websites and native apps.</p><p>Since its <a href=\"/stream-live/\">beta launch</a>, developers have used Stream to broadcast live concerts from some of the world’s most popular artists directly to fans, build brand-new video creator platforms, operate a global 24/7 live OTT service, and more. While in beta, Stream has ingested millions of minutes of live video and delivered to viewers all over the world.</p><p><b>Bring your big live events, ambitious new video subscription service, or the next mobile video app with millions of users — we’re ready for it.</b></p><h2>Streaming live video at scale is hard</h2><p><b>Live video uses a massive amount of bandwidth.</b> For example, a one-hour live stream at 1080p at 8Mbps is 3.6GB. At <a href=\"/aws-egregious-egress/\">typical cloud provider egress prices</a>, even a little egress can break the bank.</p><p><b>Live video must be encoded on-the-fly, in real-time.</b> People expect to be able to watch live video on their phone, while connected to mobile networks with less bandwidth, higher latency and frequently interrupted connections. To support this, live video must be re-encoded in real-time into multiple resolutions, allowing someone’s phone to drop to a lower resolution and continue playback. This can be complex (Which bitrates? Which codecs? How many?) and costly: running a fleet of virtual machines doesn’t come cheap.</p><p><b>Ingest location matters</b> — Live streaming protocols like RTMPS send video over TCP. If a single packet is dropped or lost, the entire connection is brought to a halt while the packet is found and re-transmitted. This is known as “head of line blocking”. The further away the broadcaster is from the ingest server, the more network hops, and the more likely packets will be dropped or lost, ultimately resulting in latency and buffering for viewers.</p><p><b>Delivery location matters</b> — Live video must be cached and served from points of presence as close to viewers as possible. The longer the network round trips, the more likely videos will buffer or drop to a lower quality.</p><p><b>Broadcasting protocols are in flux</b> — The most widely used protocol for streaming live video, RTMPS, has been abandoned since 2012, and dates back to the era of Flash video in the early 2000s. A new emerging standard, SRT, is not yet supported everywhere. And WebRTC has only recently evolved into an option for high definition one-to-many broadcasting at scale.</p><p>The old way to solve this has been to stitch together separate cloud services from different vendors. One vendor provides excellent content delivery, but no encoding. Another provides APIs or hardware to encode, but leaves you to fend for yourself and build your own storage layer. As a developer, you have to learn, manage and write a layer of glue code around the esoteric details of video streaming protocols, codecs, encoding settings and delivery pipelines.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7epyhfBFSlN7AMdqROyaNE/bdab7b8a4d8ed717ca13889f573ae577/image4-8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1168\" height=\"991\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We built Stream Live to make streaming live video easy, like adding an  tag to a website. Live video is now a fundamental building block of Internet content, and we think any developer should have the tools to add it to their website or native app.</p><p>With Stream, you or your users stream live video directly to Cloudflare, and Cloudflare delivers video directly to your viewers. You never have to manage internal encoding, storage, or delivery systems — it’s just live video in and live video out.</p><h2>Our network, our hardware = a solution only Cloudflare can provide</h2><p>We’re not the only ones building APIs for live video — but we are the only ones with our <b><i>own</i></b> global network and hardware that we control and optimize for video. That lets us do things that others can’t, like <a href=\"/magic-hdmi-cable/\">sub-second glass-to-glass latency</a> using RTMPS and SRT playback at scale.</p><p>Newer video codecs require specialized hardware encoders, and while others are beholden to the hardware limitations of public cloud providers, we’re already hard at work installing the latest encoding hardware in our own racks, so that you can deliver high resolution video with even less bandwidth. Our goal is to make what is otherwise only available to video giants available directly to you — stay tuned for some exciting updates on this next week.</p><p>Most providers limit how many destinations you can restream or simulcast to. Because we operate our own network, we’ve never even worried about this, and let you <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/stream-live/simulcasting/\">restream to as many destinations as you need</a>.</p><p>Operating our own network lets us price Stream based on minutes of video delivered — unlike others, we don’t pay someone else for bandwidth and then pass along their costs to you at a markup. The status quo of charging for bandwidth or per-GB storage penalizes you for delivering or storing high resolution content. If you ask why a few times, most of the time you’ll discover that others are pushing their own cost structures on to you.</p><p>Encoding video is compute-intensive, delivering video is bandwidth intensive, and location matters when ingesting live video. When you use Stream, you don&#39;t need to worry about optimizing performance, finding a CDN, and/or tweaking configuration endlessly. Stream takes care of this for you.</p><h2>Free your live video from the business models of big platforms</h2><p>Nearly every business uses live video, whether to engage with customers, broadcast events or monetize live content. But few have the specialized engineering resources to deliver live video at scale on their own, and wire together multiple low level cloud services. To date, many of the largest content creators have been forced to depend on a shortlist of social media apps and streaming services to deliver live content at scale.</p><p>Unlike the status quo, who force you to put your live video in <i>their</i> apps and services and fit <i>their</i> business models, Stream gives you full control of your live video, on <i>your</i> website or app, on any device, at scale, without pushing your users to someone else’s service.</p><h2>Free encoding. Free ingestion. Free analytics. Simple per-minute pricing.</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-c6q4{font-family:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-dkn2{background-color:#CCC;font-family:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0fkh{background-color:#CCC;font-family:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-3xvn{font-family:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n</style>\n<table class=\"tg\" width=\"100%\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-dkn2\"></th>\n    <th class=\"tg-0fkh\"><span style=\"font-weight:700;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Others</span></th>\n    <th class=\"tg-0fkh\"><span style=\"font-weight:700;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Stream</span></th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-3xvn\"><span style=\"font-weight:700;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Encoding</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">$ per minute</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Free</span></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-3xvn\"><span style=\"font-weight:700;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Ingestion</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">$ per GB</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Free</span></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-3xvn\"><span style=\"font-weight:700;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Analytics</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Separate product</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Free</span></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-3xvn\"><span style=\"font-weight:700;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Live recordings</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Minutes or hours later</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Instant</span></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-3xvn\"><span style=\"font-weight:700;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Storage</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">$ per GB </span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">per minute stored</span></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-3xvn\"><span style=\"font-weight:700;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Delivery</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">$ per GB</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-c6q4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">per minute delivered</span></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Other platforms charge for ingestion and encoding.
