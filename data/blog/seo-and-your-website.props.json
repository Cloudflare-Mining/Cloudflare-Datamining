For most website owners, a Content Management System is key. The WordPress platform would be my first choice, you don&#39;t have to deal with structure of a Wordpress site to make sure it&#39;s easily searchable and findable. WordPress ranks high, especially if you activate <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a>. A combination of those two alone put you a long way ahead of where smaller business are. Correct structure is a good thing.</p><p>Step two - Focus on great content. Sporadic posting is never going to yield a tangible output. The more Google changes their algorithms, the more likely you will get ranked lower if you&#39;re not posting often. Just posting frequently however isn&#39;t enough. Content has always risen to the top of rankings, and as search engines mature, they are continuing to increase the signal to noise ratio. Posting great content regularly is the key to SEO success.</p><p>Step three - find good website hosting that will be elastic. Great content that gets picked up on TechCrunch, Digg, Reddit - any viral site - is going to see heavy spikes in traffic. If you&#39;re on a cheap hosting plan you often won&#39;t be able to scale to meet demands.</p><p>Actually, one of the first things I do is recommend CloudFlare. I love the CDN and scalability, it takes load off of the server so you don&#39; have to worry so much about load spikes.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"cf-what-are-some-of-the-misperceptions-with-seo\">CF - What are some of the misperceptions with SEO?</h4>\n      <a href=\"#cf-what-are-some-of-the-misperceptions-with-seo\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>DP - A big misperception about SEO is the idea that you have to somehow change your writing or write things that are for search engines instead of humans. That&#39;s not the case. A lot of people also say you have to have unnaturally high keyword density and that&#39;s the only way you&#39;re going to rank. That&#39;s not good, it&#39;s harmful. Google sees that as if you&#39;re writing it specifically for SEO. Search engines try to read content as if they were human. If the content doesn&#39;t flow well or read well for a human, chances are it&#39;s not going to read well for a search engine or spider.</p><p>SEO is all about having good content. Write content you and others would like to read. It is more likely be shared socially, bringing more people to your site, and more people will link back to your site, growing your online presence.</p><p>When people think of SEO they tend to focus on the 10 percent that&#39;s the little tweaks that SEO companies can do for you, whereas the bulk of the value comes from writing good content.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"cf-web-properties-care-a-lot-about-seo-what-are-some-good-resources-for-site-owners-looking-to-better-their-seo-rank\">CF - Web properties care a lot about SEO, what are some good resources for site owners looking to better their SEO rank?</h4>\n      <a href=\"#cf-web-properties-care-a-lot-about-seo-what-are-some-good-resources-for-site-owners-looking-to-better-their-seo-rank\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>DP - There are a number of places on the web that have good SEO forums.

There&#39;s a lot of SEO weight on title and header tags, you need to have your page title similar to whatever is in your H1 tag. A lot of site owners out there don&#39;t have header tags or have them set-up correctly. Even if they have a good title, the title might not be in the HTML header tag. The title and headers help both search engines and more importantly humans identify the focus of the page.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"cf-how-has-your-industry-changed-in-the-last-five-years\">CF - How has your industry changed in the last five years?</h4>\n      <a href=\"#cf-how-has-your-industry-changed-in-the-last-five-years\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>DP - I think SEO has a bit of a stigma because of old tactics that people used to use. You used to be able to immediately rank for SEO by using tricks like white text on a white background and various other tactics to gain the system. Even just recently Google has released things like Penguin, making it harder and harder to game the system. It changes how SEO agencies function, shifting the focus from link building to strategic content driven approaches.

You can&#39;t ignore Bing when you&#39;re tracking rankings, but they are definitely playing second fiddle to Google at this point.</p><p>For a long time Google has provided the best search rankings. Whether or not Bing has closed the gap on search, they have an uphill battle. People are used to Google, it&#39;s becoming part of the English language. I doubt that anyone outside of Microsoft headquarters has ever said &quot;I don&#39;t know the answer, let me go Bing it.&quot;</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"cloudflare-in-his-own-words\">CloudFlare...in his own words</h4>\n      <a href=\"#cloudflare-in-his-own-words\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>I&#39;ve been using CloudFlare for over a year now. I had a personal website called<a href=\"http://soccerreviews.com/\">soccerreviews.com</a>. I built it up to have significant traffic and I was really having server load issues, in addition to having been hacked twice. Because of that, security and scalability was very important to me.</p><p>I tried CloudFlare on that site and I now have it on 30 other sites. I have yet to have any of those sites compromised, which has been fantastic.</p><p>Once I joined SEO.com, I put us on CloudFlare. One feature I really like about CloudFlare is Rocket Loader. It combines all my javascript files and speeds them up, and they aren&#39;t all being downloaded separately, decreasing download time.</p><p>As for the impact to SEO, bounce rate plays a very important role in how Google does their rankings - they see that as a human factor in SEO. If someone immediately jumps back to Google, it&#39;s obviously not a good human source. A fast site that&#39;s always online is sure to help your rankings with lower bounce rates, and having CloudFlare helps to make this possible.</p>",
