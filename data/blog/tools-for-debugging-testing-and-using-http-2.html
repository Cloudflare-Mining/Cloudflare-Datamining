	<p>With CloudFlare's release of HTTP/2 for all our customers the web suddenly has a lot of HTTP/2 connections. To get the most out of HTTP/2 you'll want to be using an up to date web browser (all the major browsers support HTTP/2).</p>
	<p>But there are some non-browser tools that come in handy when working with HTTP/2. This blog post starts with a useful browser add-on, and then delves into command-line tools, load testing, conformance verification, development libraries and packet decoding for HTTP/2.</p>
	<p>If you know of something that I've missed please write a comment.</p>
	<h3 id="browserindicators">Browser Indicators</h3>
	<p>For Google Chrome there's a handy <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/http2-and-spdy-indicator/mpbpobfflnpcgagjijhmgnchggcjblin?hl=en" target="_blank">HTTP/2 and SPDY Indicator</a> extension that adds a colored lightning bolt to the browser bar showing the protocol being used when a web page is viewed.</p>
	<p>The blue lightning bolt shown here indicates that the CloudFlare home page was served using HTTP/2:</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-12-08-25.png" alt=""></p>
	<p>A green lightning bolt indicates the site was served using SPDY and gives the SPDY version number. In this case SPDY/3.1:</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-12-15-10.png" alt=""></p>
	<p>A grey lightning bolt indicates that neither HTTP/2 no SPDY were used. Here the web page was served using HTTP/1.1.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-12-10-18.png" alt=""></p>
	<p>There's a similar extension for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/spdy-indicator/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>.</p>
	<h4 id="onlinetesting">Online testing</h4>
	<p>There's also a handy <a href="https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test" target="_blank">online tool</a> to check any individual web site.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-12-22-11.png" alt=""></p>
	<h4 id="claire">Claire</h4>
	<p>CloudFlare also has a Google Chrome extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/claire/fgbpcgddpmjmamlibbaobboigaijnmkl" target="_blank">Claire</a> that gives information about how a web page was loaded. For example here's the information that Claire shows for a site using CloudFlare that uses <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ipv6" target="_blank">IPv6</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/railgun" target="_blank">Railgun</a>, and HTTP/2.<br>

	<br>
	<h3 id="commandlinetools">Command-line Tools</h3>
	<p>There's a handy command-line tool called <a href="https://github.com/stefanjudis/is-http2-cli" target="_blank">is-http</a> which is installed using npm as follows:</p>
	<pre><code>npm install -g is-http2-cli
</code></pre>
	<p>Once installed you can check the HTTP/2 status of a web on the command-line:</p>
	<pre><code>$ is-http2 www.cloudflare.com
✓ HTTP/2 supported by www.cloudflare.com
Supported protocols: h2 spdy/3.1 http/1.1

$ is-http2 www.amazon.com
× HTTP/2 not supported by www.amazon.com
Supported protocols: http/1.1
</code></pre>
	<p>The <code>is-http</code> tool is also useful because it gives you a list of the protocols advertised by the server. As you can see www.cloudflare.com supports HTTP/2, HTTP/1.1 and SPDY/3.1.</p>
	<h4 id="curl">curl</h4>
	<p>In version 7.43.0 the venerable <code>curl</code> tool got HTTP/2 support when it's linked with the <a href="https://nghttp2.org/" target="_blank">nghttp</a> library. To build <code>curl</code> from sources you'll need OpenSSL, zlib, nghttp2 and libev. I used the following sequence of commands.</p>
	<pre><code>$ curl -LO http://dist.schmorp.de/libev/libev-4.20.tar.gz
$ tar zvxf libev-4.20.tar.gz
$ cd libev-4.20
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

$ curl -LO https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2d.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf openssl-1.0.2d.tar.gz
$ cd openssl-1.0.2d
$ ./config shared zlib-dynamic
$ make &amp;&amp; make test
$ sudo make install

$ curl -LO http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
$ cd zlib-1.2.8
$ ./configure
$ make &amp;&amp; make test
$ sudo make install

$ curl -LO https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/nghttp2/releases/download/v1.5.0/nghttp2-1.5.0.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf nghttp2-1.5.0.tar.gz
$ cd nghttp2-1.5.0
$ OPENSSL_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/ssl/include" OPENSSL_LIBS="-L/usr/local/ssl/lib -lssl -lcrypto -ldl" ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

$ curl -LO http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.46.0.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf curl-7.46.0.tar.gz
$ cd curl-7.46.0
$ ./configure
$ make &amp;&amp; make test
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
</code></pre>
	<p>Once installed <code>curl</code> has a new <code>--http2</code> option that causes it to use HTTP/2 (if it can). The <code>-v</code> verbose option will show information about the use of HTTP/2:</p>
	<pre><code>$ curl -vso /dev/null --http2 https://www.cloudflare.com/
[...]
* Using HTTP2, server supports multi-use
* Connection state changed (HTTP/2 confirmed)
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Copying HTTP/2 data in stream buffer to connection buffer after upgrade: len=0
* Using Stream ID: 1 (easy handle 0xc3dba0)
[...]
</code></pre>
	<h4 id="nghttp2">nghttp2</h4>
	<p>If you built <code>curl</code> using my instructions above you will have built and installed some tools that come with the <a href="https://nghttp2.org/" target="_blank">nghttp2</a> library. One of those is a command-line client called <code>nghttp</code>. It can be used like <code>curl</code> to download from the web using HTTP/2 but it also has a handy verbose option that shows that actual HTTP/2 frames sent and received.</p>
	<p>By running it with <code>-nv</code> you get HTTP/2 and throw away the actual downloaded page. Here's its output when downloading www.cloudflare.com using HTTP/2. On a terminal with color support it uses coloring to highlight different parts of the log.<br>
		<br>
	</p>
	<div align="center"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-13-24-46.png" style="width: 300px"></div>
	<br>
	<h4 id="h2c">h2c</h4>
	<p>Another curl-like command-line tool for HTTP/2 is <a href="https://github.com/fstab/h2c" target="_blank">h2c</a>. It also enables dumping of HTTP/2 frames and has a nice feature that it runs in the background and keeps connections to servers alive and has a useful 'wiretap' feature for intercepting an HTTP/2 for debugging.</p>
	<p>If you have <a href="https://golang.org/dl/" target="_blank">Go 1.5.1</a> installed then you can download it as follows:</p>
	<pre><code>$ export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1
$ go get github.com/fstab/h2c
</code></pre>
	<p>You start <code>h2c</code> running by doing <code>h2c start &amp;</code> which sets it running in the background. You can then communicate with a web server like this:</p>
	<pre><code> $ h2c connect www.cloudflare.com
 $ h2c get /
 $ h2c disconnect
</code></pre>
	<p>And it will perform the HTTP request. To see detailed output at the HTTP/2 you start h2c with the <code>--dump</code> parameter:</p>
	<pre><code> $ h2c start --dump
</code></pre>
	<p>You will then get detailed output dumped by that process, in color, of the HTTP/2 frames being used.<br>
		<br>

	<br>
	Details of the wiretap feature are in [this blog post](http://unrestful.io/2015/08/28/wiretap.html).
	<h4 id="openssls_client">openssl s_client</h4>
	<p>If you just want to find out what protocols a web site supports OpenSSL's <code>s_client</code> can be used. If you specify an empty <code>-nextprotoneg</code> option OpenSSL sends an empty TLS option asking for negotiation of the next protocol and the server responds with a complete list of protocols it supports.</p>
	<pre><code>$ openssl s_client -connect www.cloudflare.com:443 -nextprotoneg ''
CONNECTED(00000003)
Protocols advertised by server: h2, spdy/3.1, http/1.1
</code></pre>
	<p>There you can see that www.cloudflare.com support HTTP/2 (the h2), SPDY/3.1 and HTTP/1.1.</p>
	<h4 id="h2i">h2i</h4>
	<p>If you want to do low level HTTP/2 debugging there's an interactive client call <a href="https://github.com/golang/net/tree/master/http2/h2i" target="_blank">h2i</a>. Once again it requires that you have Go installed. To get it, run</p>
	<pre><code>$ go get github.com/golang/net/http2/h2i
</code></pre>
	<p>You can then use <code>h2i</code> to connect to a site that uses HTTP/2 and send it individual HTTP/2 frames. For example, here's the start of session connecting to www.cloudflare.com and requesting the home page using the <code>headers</code> command which allows you to type in a standard HTTP/1.1 request.</p>
	<pre><code>$ h2i www.cloudflare.com
Connecting to www.cloudflare.com:443 ...

	<h3 id="loadtesting">Load Testing</h3>
	<p>The <a href="https://nghttp2.org" target="_blank">nghttp2</a> library also includes a load testing tool called <a href="https://nghttp2.org/documentation/h2load.1.html" target="_blank">h2load</a> which can be used a little like <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html" target="_blank">ab</a>. There's a useful <a href="https://nghttp2.org/documentation/h2load-howto.html" target="_blank">HOWTO</a> on using the tool.</p>
	<p>I ran it against the CloudFlare test server like this:</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-16-02-50.png" alt=""></p>
	<h3 id="conformance">Conformance</h3>
	<p>If you are testing an HTTP/2 implementation there's a useful tool called <a http:="" blog.cloudflare.com="" tools-for-debugging-testing-and-using-http-2="" href="">h2spec</a> which runs through a conformance test against a real HTTP/2 server. To use it first install <a href="https://golang.org/dl/" target="_blank">Go 1.5.1</a> and then do</p>
	<pre><code>$ go get github.com/summerwind/h2spec/cmd/h2spec
</code></pre>
	<p>I only recommend it for testing locally running HTTP/2 servers. If you built <code>nghttp2</code> above while building <code>curl</code> you will also have the <code>nghttpd</code> HTTP/2 server available. You can run <code>h2spec</code> against it like this:</p>
	<pre><code>$ nghttpd --no-tls -D -d /tmp 8888
$ h2spec -p 8888
</code></pre>
	<p><code>h2spec</code> will run a battery of tests against the server and output conformance information with a reference to the relevant part of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540" target="_blank">RFC7540</a>.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-14-49-07.png" alt=""></p>
	<p>If you need to test a number of web sites to see which support HTTP/2 there's a tool called <a href="https://github.com/jgrahamc/h2scan" target="_blank">h2scan</a>. Feed it a list of web sites and it will check to see if they support HTTPS, SPDY/3.1 and HTTP/2.</p>
	<pre><code>$ cat examples
www.cloudflare.com
www.amazon.com
www.yahoo.com
$ h2scan --fields &lt; examples
name,resolves,port443Open,tlsWorks,httpsWorks,cloudflare,spdyAnnounced,http2Announced,spdyWorks,http2Works,npn

</code></pre>
	<h3 id="usefullibraries">Useful Libraries</h3>
	<p>If you are working in C and need to add HTTP/2 support to a program there's the <a href="https://nghttp2.org/" target="_blank">nghttp2</a> library that is full implementation of HTTP/2 with a simple interface. Their <a href="https://nghttp2.org/documentation/tutorial-client.html#libevent-client-c" target="_blank">HTTP/2 client tutorial</a> explains how to use the library to add HTTP/2 client capabilities. nghttp2 can also be used for <a href="https://nghttp2.org/documentation/tutorial-server.html#libevent-server-c" target="_blank">servers</a>.</p>
	<p>Go programmers will find full HTTP/2 support will arrive with Go 1.6. If you can't wait until then there's an extension package for HTTP/2 <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/http2" target="_blank">golang.org/x/net/http2</a> . Details <a href="https://http2.golang.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	<p>There's a pure Ruby implementation of HTTP/2 available from <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/http-2" target="_blank">Ilya Grigorik</a>.</p>
	<p>Haskell programmers can use the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http2" target="_blank">http2</a> hackage.</p>
	<h3 id="packetsnooping">Packet Snooping</h3>
	<p>The popular Wireshark packet analyzer added decoding on HTTP/2 in version <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/relnotes/wireshark-1.12.0.html#_new_protocol_support" target="_blank">1.12.0</a> and fully decodes HTTP/2 frames. Unfortunately most HTTP/2 is sent over TLS which means that, by default, Wireshark will not be able to decrypt the packets to be able to get to the HTTP/2 for decoding.</p>
	<p>Fortunately, there is a workaround if you are using Google Chrome for testing. It is possible to get Chrome to save the symmetric cryptographic key used for TLS connections to a file and Wireshark is able to read that file to decode TLS connections.</p>
	<p>This is done by setting the <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code> environment variable before running Chrome. I'm running on Mac OS X and use Google Chrome Canary for testing so I run:</p>
	<pre><code>% export SSLKEYLOGFILE=`pwd`/sslkey.log
% /Applications/Google\ Chrome\ Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome\ Canary
</code></pre>
	<p>Google Chrome will then write session keys to that file. In Wireshark I configure it to read the file by going to Preferences, expanding the Protocols list.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-15-48-59.png" alt=""></p>
	<p>Then I find SSL and set the Pre-Main-Secret log filename to point to the same file.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-15-49-44.png" alt=""></p>
	<p>Then Wireshark can decode the TLS connections made by that browser. Here's the beginning of a connection between Google Chrome Canary and the experimental server <a href="https://http2.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">https://http2.cloudflare.com/</a>.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-15-51-04.png" alt=""></p>
	<h3 id="chromedeveloperview">Chrome Developer View</h3>
	<p>Finally, if you are looking at the performance of your own web site it can be handy to understand which parts of the page were downloaded using HTTP/2 and which were not. You can do that pretty easily using the Developer view in Google Chrome. Here's a shot of the CloudFlare blog loaded in Chrome. There's an additional Protocol fields available on the pop-up menu.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-04-at-10-46-21.png" alt=""></p>
	<p>Once added you can sort by protocol to see which parts were HTTP/2 (the h2) and which were other protocols.</p>
