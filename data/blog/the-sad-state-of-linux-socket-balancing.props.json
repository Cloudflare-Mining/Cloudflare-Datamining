Consider these two code snippets. Let&#39;s call the first one <i>blocking-accept</i>. It&#39;s best described with this pseudo code:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.py\"><code class=\"language-.py\">sd = bind((&#039;127.0.0.1&#039;, 1024))\nfor i in range(3):\n    if os.fork () == 0:\n        while True:\n            cd, _ = sd.accept()\n            cd.close()\n            print &#039;worker %d&#039; % (i,)</pre></code>\n            <p>The idea is to share an accept queue across processes, by calling blocking accept() from multiple workers concurrently.</p><p>The second model should be called <i>epoll-and-accept</i>:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.py\"><code class=\"language-.py\">sd = bind((&#039;127.0.0.1&#039;, 1024))\nsd.setblocking(False)\nfor i in range(3):\n    if os.fork () == 0:\n        ed = select.epoll()\n        ed.register(sd, EPOLLIN | EPOLLEXCLUSIVE)\n        while True:\n            ed.poll()\n            cd, _ = sd.accept()\n            cd.close()\n            print &#039;worker %d&#039; % (i,)</pre></code>\n            <p>The intention is to have a dedicated epoll in each worker process. The worker will call non-blocking accept() only when epoll reports new connections. We can avoid <a href=\"https://idea.popcount.org/2017-02-20-epoll-is-fundamentally-broken-12/\">the usual thundering-herd issue</a> by using the EPOLLEXCLUSIVE flag.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2017-10-accept-balancing\">Full code is available here</a>)</p><p>While these programs look similar, their behavior differs subtly<a href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a> <a href=\"#fn2\">[2]</a>. Let&#39;s see what happens when we establish a couple of connections to each:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.sh\"><code class=\"language-.sh\">$ ./blocking-accept.py &amp;\n$ for i in `seq 6`; do nc localhost 1024; done\nworker 2\nworker 1\nworker 0\nworker 2\nworker 1\nworker 0\n\n$ ./epoll-and-accept.py &amp;\n$ for i in `seq 6`; do nc localhost 1024; done\nworker 0\nworker 0\nworker 0\nworker 0\nworker 0\nworker 0</pre></code>\n            <p>The <i>blocking-accept</i> model distributed connections across all workers - each got exactly 2 connections. The <i>epoll-and-accept</i> model on the other hand forwarded all the connections to the first worker. The remaining workers got no traffic whatsoever.</p><p>It might catch you by surprise, but Linux does different load balancing in both cases.</p><p>In the first one Linux will do proper FIFO-like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/round-robin-dns/\">round robin load balancing</a>. Each process waiting on accept() is added to a queue and they will be served connections in order.</p><p>In the <i>epoll-and-accept</i> the load balancing algorithm differs: Linux seems to choose the last added process, a LIFO-like behavior. The process added to the waiting queue most recently will get the new connection. This behavior causes the busiest process, the one that only just went back to event loop, to receive the majority of the new connections. Therefore, the busiest worker is likely to get most of the load.</p><p>In fact, this is what we see in NGINX. Here&#39;s a dump of one of our synthetic tests where one worker is taking most of the load, while others are relatively underutilized:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/48ZLQMh607BBPPkosXK1fL/517efe3c29ce4e152a6150b0fbd25c51/sharedqueue.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"640\" height=\"207\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Notice the last worker got almost no load, while the busiest is using 30% of CPU.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"so_reuseport-to-the-rescue\">SO_REUSEPORT to the rescue</h3>\n      <a href=\"#so_reuseport-to-the-rescue\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Linux supports a feature to work around this balancing problem - the SO_REUSEPORT socket option. We explained this in the (c) model, where the incoming connections are split into multiple separate accept queues. Usually it&#39;s one dedicated queue for each worker process.</p><p>Since the accept queues are not shared, and Linux spreads the load by a simple hashing logic, each worker will get statistically the same number of incoming connections. This results in much better <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/load-balancing/\">balancing of the load</a>. Each worker gets roughly a similar amount of traffic to handle:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5qhELjLr86d9VIXg7LoFge/03244209b07489c2d9b6134da0651b69/reuseport.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"640\" height=\"207\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Here all the workers are handling the work, with the busiest at 13.2% CPU while the least busy uses 9.3%. Much better load distribution than before.</p><p>This is better, however the balancing of the load is not the end of the story. Splitting the accept queue worsens the latency distribution in some circumstances! It&#39;s best explained by The Engineer guy:</p><p>I call this problem - the Waitrose vs Tesco Superstore cashiers. The Waitrose &quot;combined queue model&quot; is better at reducing the maximum <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/glossary/what-is-latency/\">latency</a>. A single clogged cashier will not significantly affect the latency of whole system. The remainder of the load will be spread across the other less busy cashiers. The shared queue will be drained relatively promptly. On the other hand the Tesco Superstore model - of separate queues to each cashier - will suffer from the large latency issue. If a single cashier gets blocked,  all the traffic waiting in its queue will stall. The maximum latency will grow if any single queue gets stuck.</p><p>In a case of increased load the (b) single accept queue model, while is not balancing the load evenly, is better for latency. We can show this by running another synthetic benchmark. Here is the latency distribution for 100k relatively CPU-intensive <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/\">HTTP requests</a>, with HTTP keepalives disabled, concurrency set to 200 and running against a single-queue (b) NGINX:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.sh\"><code class=\"language-.sh\">$ ./benchhttp -n 100000 -c 200 -r target:8181 http://a.a/\n        | cut -d &quot; &quot; -f 1\n        | ./mmhistogram -t &quot;Duration in ms (single queue)&quot;\nmin:3.61 avg:30.39 med=30.28 max:72.65 dev:1.58 count:100000\nDuration in ms (single queue):\n value |-------------------------------------------------- count\n     0 |                                                   0\n     1 |                                                   0\n     2 |                                                   1\n     4 |                                                   16\n     8 |                                                   67\n    16 |************************************************** 91760\n    32 |                                              **** 8155\n    64 |                                                   1</pre></code>\n            <p>As you can see the latency is very predictable.

Epoll is more powerful and allows us to create rich event driven programs. Using blocking accept is rather cumbersome or just not useful at all. To make any sense, blocking accept programs would require careful multi-threading programming, with a dedicated thread per request. <a href=\"#fnref1\">↩︎</a></p></li><li><p>Another surprise lurking in the corner - using blocking accept() on Linux is technically incorrect! Alan Burlison pointed out that calling <a href=\"https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg83683.html\">close() on listen socket that has blocking accepts() will not interrupt them</a>. This can result in a buggy behavior - you may get <a href=\"https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106241\">a successful accept() on a listen socket that no longer exists</a>. When in doubt - avoid using blocking accept() in multithreaded programs. The workaround is to call shutdown() first, but this is not POSIX compliant. It&#39;s a mess. <a href=\"#fnref2\">↩︎</a></p></li><li><p>There are a couple of things you need to take into account when using NGINX reuseport implementation. First make sure you run 1.13.6+ or have <a href=\"https://github.com/nginx/nginx/commit/da165aae88601628cef8db1646cd0ce3f0ee661f\">this patch applied</a>. Then, remember that due to a <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/\">defect in Linux TCP REUSEPORT implementation</a> reducing number of REUSEPORT queues will cause some waiting TCP connections to be dropped. <a href=\"#fnref3\">↩︎</a></p></li></ol>",
