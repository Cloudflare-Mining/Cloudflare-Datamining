Over the last seven years, this highly <a href=\"https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers\"><u>performant</u></a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/\"><u>privacy</u></a>-<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-the-results-of-the-1-1-1-1-public-dns-resolver-privacy-examination\"><u>conscious</u></a> service has grown to handle an average of 1.9 Trillion queries per day from approximately 250 locations (countries/regions) around the world. Aggregated analysis of this traffic provides us with unique insight into Internet activity that goes beyond simple Web traffic trends, and we currently use analysis of 1.1.1.1 data to power Radar&#39;s <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains\"><u>Domains</u></a> page, as well as the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-domain-rankings\"><u>Radar Domain Rankings</u></a>.</p><p>In December 2022, Cloudflare <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-as112-project/\"><u>joined the AS112 Project</u></a>, which helps the Internet deal with misdirected DNS queries. In March 2023, we launched an <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as112\"><u>AS112 statistics</u></a> page on Radar, providing insight into traffic trends and query types for this misdirected traffic. Extending the basic analysis presented on that page, and building on the analysis of resolver data used for the Domains page, today we are excited to launch a dedicated DNS page on Cloudflare Radar to provide increased visibility into aggregate traffic and usage trends seen across 1.1.1.1 resolver traffic. In addition to looking at global, location, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/\"><u>autonomous system (ASN)</u></a> traffic trends, we are also providing perspectives on protocol usage, query and response characteristics, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/\"><u>DNSSEC</u></a> usage.</p><p>The traffic analyzed for this new page may come from users that have manually configured their devices or local routers to use 1.1.1.1 as a resolver, ISPs that set 1.1.1.1 as the default resolver for their subscribers, ISPs that use 1.1.1.1 as a resolver upstream from their own, or users that have installed Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://one.one.one.one/\"><u>1.1.1.1/WARP app</u></a> on their device. The traffic analysis is based on anonymised DNS query logs, in accordance with <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/\"><u>Cloudflare’s Privacy Policy</u></a>, as well as our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/\"><u>1.1.1.1 Public DNS Resolver privacy commitments</u></a>.</p><p>Below, we walk through the sections of Radar’s new DNS page, reviewing the included graphs and the importance of the metrics they present.

Similar to other Radar traffic-based graphs, the time period shown can be adjusted using the date picker, and for the default selections (last 24 hours, last 7 days, etc.), a comparison with traffic seen over the previous period is also plotted.</p><p>For location-level views (such as <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns/lv\"><u>Latvia</u></a>, in the example below), a table showing the top five ASNs by query volume is displayed alongside the graph.

The graph includes a line showing worldwide query volume for that ccTLD, as well as a line showing the query volume based on queries from the associated location. <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns/ai#dns-query-volume-for-ai-domains\"><u>Anguilla’s</u></a> ccTLD is .ai, and is a popular choice among the growing universe of AI-focused companies. While most locations see a gap between the worldwide and “local” query volume for their ccTLD, Anguilla’s is rather significant — as the graph below illustrates, this size of the gap is driven by both the popularity of the ccTLD and Anguilla’s comparatively small user base. (Traffic for .ai domains from Anguilla is shown by the dark blue line at the bottom of the graph.) Similarly, sizable gaps are seen with other “popular” ccTLDs as well, such as .io (<a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns/io#dns-query-volume-for-io-domains\"><u>British Indian Ocean Territory</u></a>), .fm (<a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns/fm#dns-query-volume-for-fm-domains\"><u>Federated States of Micronesia</u></a>), and .co (<a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns/co#dns-query-volume-for-co-domains\"><u>Colombia</u></a>). A higher “local” ccTLD query volume in other locations results in smaller gaps when compared to the worldwide query volume.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6LXc2OLAoHqAVbgspo5cjb/c01b9f7e90d1d27f66eb3dcb35bf2622/02.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1866\" height=\"850\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Depending on the strength of the signal (that is, the volume of traffic) from a given location or ASN, this data can also be used to corroborate reported Internet outages or shutdowns, or reported blocking of 1.1.1.1.

However, as privacy has become a significantly greater concern, encrypted queries have been made possible through the specification of <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7858\"><u>DNS over TLS</u></a> (DoT) in 2016 and <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8484\"><u>DNS over HTTPS</u></a> (DoH) in 2018. Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 resolver has <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/#toward-a-better-dns-infrastructure\"><u>supported both of these privacy-preserving protocols since launch</u></a>. The <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns#dns-transport-protocol\"><b><u>DNS transport protocol</u></b></a> graph shows the distribution of queries to 1.1.1.1 over these four protocols. (Setting up 1.1.1.1 <a href=\"https://one.one.one.one/dns/\"><u>on your device or router</u></a> uses DNS over UDP by default, although recent versions of <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/android/#configure-1111-manually\"><u>Android</u></a> support DoT and DoH. The <a href=\"https://one.one.one.one/\"><u>1.1.1.1 app</u></a> uses DNS over HTTPS by default, and users can also <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/encrypted-dns-browsers/\"><u>configure their browsers</u></a> to use DNS over HTTPS.)</p><p>Note that Cloudflare&#39;s resolver also services queries over DoH and <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/oblivious-dns/\"><u>Oblivious DoH (ODoH)</u></a> for <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/cloudflare-resolver-firefox/\"><u>Mozilla</u></a> and other large platforms, but this traffic is not currently included in our analysis. As such, DoH adoption is under-represented in this graph.</p><p>Aggregated worldwide between February 19 - February 26, distribution of transport protocols was 86.6% for UDP, 9.6% for DoT, 2.0% for TCP, and 1.7% for DoH. However, in some locations, these ratios may shift if users are more privacy conscious. For example, the graph below shows the distribution for <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns/eg\"><u>Egypt</u></a> over the same time period. In that country, the UDP and TCP shares are significantly lower than the global level, while the DoT and DoH shares are significantly higher, suggesting that users there may be more concerned about the privacy of their DNS queries than the global average, or that there is a larger concentration of 1.1.1.1 users on Android devices who have set up 1.1.1.1 using DoT manually. (The 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review found that <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/eg#ios-vs-android\"><u>Android had an 85% mobile device traffic share in Egypt</u></a>, so mobile device usage in the country leans very heavily toward Android.)</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1srd6prVQCUxHvxw8eFNjL/987f2d925120be867174fd04a8c7eb2c/05-b.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1860\" height=\"844\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>RFC 1035 also defined a number of <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-3.3\"><u>standard</u></a> and <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-3.4\"><u>Internet specific</u></a> resource record types that return the associated information about the submitted query name. The most common record types are <code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code>, which return the hostname’s IPv4 and IPv6 addresses respectively (assuming they exist). The <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns#dns-query-type\"><b><u>DNS query type</u></b></a> graph below shows that globally, these two record types comprise on the order of 80% of the queries received by 1.1.1.1.

Others, such as <code>NXDOMAIN</code>, <code>SERVFAIL</code>, <code>REFUSED</code>, and <code>NOTIMP</code> define specific error conditions encountered when trying to resolve the requested query name. The response codes may be generated by 1.1.1.1 itself (like <code>REFUSED</code>) or may come from an upstream authoritative nameserver (like <code>NXDOMAIN</code>).</p><p>The <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns#dns-response-code\"><b><u>DNS response code</u></b></a> graph shown below highlights that the vast majority of queries seen globally do not encounter an error during the resolution process (<code>NOERROR</code>), and that when errors are encountered, most are <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8020\"><code><u>NXDOMAIN</u></code></a> (no such record). It is worth noting that <code>NOERROR</code> also includes empty responses, which occur when there are no records for the query name and query type, but there are records for the query name and some other query type.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6ZXQ8kcT0H7zfb8najn42C/df8c8c2f54c492484bb5d59f437eee5d/07.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1862\" height=\"848\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>With DNS being a first-step dependency for many other protocols, the amount of queries of particular types can be used to indirectly measure the adoption of those protocols. But to effectively measure adoption, we should also consider the fraction of those queries that are met with useful responses, which are represented with the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns#dns-record-adoption\"><b><u>DNS record adoption</u></b></a> graphs.</p><p>The example below shows that queries for <code>A</code> records are met with a useful response nearly 88% of the time. As IPv4 is an established protocol, the remaining 12% are likely to be queries for valid hostnames that have no <code>A </code>records (e.g. email domains that only have MX records). But the same graph also shows that there’s still a <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/ipv6-from-dns-pov/\"><u>significant adoption gap</u></a> where IPv6 is concerned.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6blxaHcK6UtPp67V3SGNML/daed03be6793aab32ec21b2bb2f08374/08.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1862\" height=\"946\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When Cloudflare’s DNS resolver gets a response back from an upstream authoritative nameserver, it caches it for a specified amount of time — more on that below. By caching these responses, it can more efficiently serve subsequent queries for the same name. The <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns#dns-cache-hit-ratio\"><b><u>DNS cache hit ratio</u></b></a> graph provides insight into how frequently responses are served from cache. At a global level, as seen below, over 80% of queries have a response that is already cached. These ratios will vary by location or ASN, as the query patterns differ across geographies and networks.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/sj0gBv53GdPF0slfGlKlr/fa86ff6fc610aefad2e675c5dc926f54/09.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1862\" height=\"846\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As noted in the preceding paragraph, when an authoritative nameserver sends a response back to 1.1.1.1, each record inside it includes information about how long it should be cached/considered valid for. This piece of information is known as the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/ttl/\"><u>Time-To-Live (TTL)</u></a> and, as a response may contain multiple records, the smallest of these TTLs (the “minimum” TTL) defines how long 1.1.1.1 can cache the entire response for. The TTLs on each response served from 1.1.1.1’s cache decrease towards zero as time passes, at which point 1.1.1.1 needs to go back to the authoritative nameserver. Hostnames with relatively low TTL values suggest that the records may be somewhat dynamic, possibly due to traffic management of the associated resources; longer TTL values suggest that the associated resources are more stable and expected to change infrequently.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns#dns-minimum-ttl\"><b><u>DNS minimum TTL</u></b></a> graphs show the aggregate distribution of TTL values for five popular DNS record types, broken out across seven buckets ranging from under one minute to over one week. During the third week of February, for example, <code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code> responses had a concentration of low TTLs, with over 80% below five minutes. In contrast, <code>NS</code> and <code>MX</code> responses were more concentrated across 15 minutes to one hour and one hour to one day. Because <code>MX</code> and <code>NS</code> records change infrequently, they are generally configured with higher TTLs. This allows them to be cached for longer periods in order to achieve faster DNS resolution.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3r6ppahpkqyfAHi89LWNA1/6dc6f52e92c1d7aa2dfaeaa411deb982/10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1860\" height=\"942\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"dns-security\">DNS security</h3>\n            <a href=\"#dns-security\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-security/\"><u>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)</u></a> add an extra layer of authentication to DNS establishing the integrity and authenticity of a DNS response. This ensures subsequent HTTPS requests are not routed to a spoofed domain. When sending a query to 1.1.1.1, a DNS client can indicate that it is DNSSEC-aware by setting a specific flag (the “DO” bit) in the query, which lets our resolver know that it is OK to return DNSSEC data in the response. The <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns#dnssec-client-awareness\"><b><u>DNSSEC client awareness</u></b></a> graph breaks down the share of queries that 1.1.1.1 sees from clients that understand DNSSEC and can require validation of responses vs. those that don’t. (Note that by default, 1.1.1.1 tries to protect clients by always validating DNSSEC responses from authoritative nameservers and not forwarding invalid responses to clients, unless the client has explicitly told it not to by setting the “CD” (checking-disabled) bit in the query.)</p><p>Unfortunately, as the graph below shows, nearly 90% of the queries seen by Cloudflare’s resolver are made by clients that are not DNSSEC-aware. This broad lack of client awareness may be due to several factors. On the client side, DNSSEC is not enabled by default for most users, and enabling DNSSEC requires extra work, even for technically savvy and security conscious users. On the authoritative side, for domain owners, supporting DNSSEC requires extra operational maintenance and knowledge, and a mistake can cost your domain to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/dnssec-issues-fiji/\"><u>disappear from the Internet</u></a>, causing significant (including financial) issues.</p><p>The companion <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns#end-to-end-security\"><b><u>End-to-end security</u></b></a> graph represents the fraction of DNS interactions that were protected from tampering, when considering the client’s DNSSEC capabilities and use of encryption (use of DoT or DoH). This shows an even greater imbalance at a global level, and highlights the importance of further adoption of encryption and DNSSEC.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6nErpp8o9tPuE0jt5PQ3fg/3e509065967a8f43c6679d400fd31454/11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1862\" height=\"980\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>For DNSSEC validation to occur, the query name being requested must be part of a DNSSEC-enabled domain, and the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns#dnssec-validation-status\"><b><u>DNSSEC validation status</u></b></a> graph represents the share of queries where that was the case under the <b>Secure</b> and <b>Invalid</b> labels.
