According to the <a href=\"/ddos-attack-trends-for-2022-q1/\">Cloudflare DDoS Attack Trends report</a>, in the first half of 2021 the world witnessed massive ransomware and ransom DDoS attack campaigns that interrupted critical infrastructure, including oil pipelines, healthcare, and financial services. In the second half, we saw a growing swarm of attacks, including one of the most powerful botnets deployed (<a href=\"/meris-botnet/\">Meris</a>), with record-breaking <a href=\"/cloudflare-blocks-an-almost-2-tbps-multi-vector-ddos-attack/\">network-layer attacks</a> observed on the Cloudflare network.</p><p>Along with an increase in severity, there is a proliferation of automated toolkits that make it simple and cheap for anyone to launch these attacks. Detecting and stopping these attacks manually is not effective, and network security engineers are increasingly turning to automated tools to help ensure network and application availability.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/\">DDoS protection</a> has evolved over the years from appliances to hybrid models to fully Internet-native solutions, like Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/\">Magic Transit</a>. Cloudflare has been protecting millions of Internet properties against DDoS attacks, ensuring they are available at all times. Magic Transit extends Cloudflare’s industry-leading DDoS protection to shield entire IP subnets from DDoS attacks, while also accelerating network traffic, ensuring your data centers, cloud services and corporate networks are always reachable from the Internet. Our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">powerful global network</a> spanning 250+ cities and 121 Tbps of capacity ensures that customers can have always-on DDoS protection without impacting network latency and application performance. Magic Transit also supports on-demand mode, which allows customers to activate DDoS protection when they need it most.</p><p>Network observability becomes critical to understand what normal looks like for your environment so that DDoS attacks are readily detected. Flow-based monitoring helps you understand not only how much traffic is flowing over your network, but also where it came from, where it’s going, and what applications are consuming bandwidth.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"magic-transit-protection-for-every-network-configuration\">Magic Transit protection for every network configuration</h3>\n            <a href=\"#magic-transit-protection-for-every-network-configuration\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/\">Magic Transit</a> is one of the most powerful DDoS mitigation platforms available today.
