The <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/\">Border Gateway Protocol</a> (BGP) is the de facto routing protocol that exchanges routing information among organizations and networks. At its core, BGP assumes the information being exchanged is genuine and trust-worthy, which unfortunately is <a href=\"/rpki/\">no longer a valid assumption</a> on the current Internet. In many cases, networks can make mistakes or intentionally lie about the reachability information and propagate that to the rest of the Internet. Such incidents can cause significant disruptions of the normal operations of the Internet. One type of such disruptive incident is <b>route leaks</b>.</p><p>We consider route leaks as the propagation of routing announcements beyond their intended scope (<a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7908.html\">RFC7908</a>). Route leaks can cause significant disruption affecting millions of Internet users, as we have seen in many past notable incidents. For example, <a href=\"/how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-today/\">in June 2019 a misconfiguration</a> in a small network in Pennsylvania, US (<a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/as396531\">AS396531</a> - Allegheny Technologies Inc) accidentally leaked a Cloudflare prefix to Verizon, which proceeded to propagate the misconfigured route to the rest of its peers and customers. As a result, the traffic of a large portion of the Internet was squeezed through the limited-capacity links of a small network. The resulting congestion caused most of Cloudflare traffic to and from the affected IP range to be dropped.</p><p>A similar incident in November 2018 caused widespread unavailability of Google services when a Nigerian ISP (<a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/as37282\">AS37282</a> - Mainone) <a href=\"/how-a-nigerian-isp-knocked-google-offline/\">accidentally leaked</a> a large number of Google IP prefixes to its peers and providers violating the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/974527\">valley-free principle</a>.</p><p>These incidents illustrate not only that route leaks can be very impactful, but also the snowball effects that misconfigurations in small regional networks can have on the global Internet.</p><p>Despite the criticality of detecting and rectifying route leaks promptly, they are often detected only when users start reporting the noticeable effects of the leaks. The challenge with detecting and preventing route leaks stems from the fact that AS business relationships and BGP routing policies are generally <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/974523\">undisclosed</a>, and the affected network is often remote to the root of the route leak.</p><p>In the past few years, solutions have been proposed to prevent the propagation of leaked routes. Such proposals include <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9234/\">RFC9234</a> and <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification\">ASPA</a>, which extends the BGP to annotate sessions with the relationship type between the two connected AS networks to enable the detention and prevention of route leaks.</p><p>An alternative proposal to implement similar signaling of BGP roles is through the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol#Communities\">BGP Communities</a>; a transitive attribute used to encode metadata in BGP announcements. While these directions are promising in the long term, they are still in very preliminary stages and are not expected to be adopted at scale soon.</p><p>At Cloudflare, we have developed a system to detect route leak events automatically and send notifications to multiple channels for visibility. As we continue our efforts to bring more relevant <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/\">data to the public</a>, we are happy to announce that we are starting an <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar_get_BGPRouteLeakEvents\">open data API</a> for our route leak detection results today and integrate results to <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> pages.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4bWYvHZtatR3ooYMKq2WCb/79ef433f8c46c40aefa2fefe35905aa7/image4-32.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1310\" height=\"602\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"route-leak-definition-and-types\">Route leak definition and types</h2>\n      <a href=\"#route-leak-definition-and-types\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Before we jump into how we design our systems, we will first do a quick primer on what a route leak is, and why it is important to detect it.</p><p>We refer to the published IETF RFC7908 document <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7908.html\"><i>&quot;Problem Definition and Classification of BGP Route Leaks&quot;</i></a> to define route leaks.</p><p>&gt; A route leak is the propagation of routing announcement(s) beyond their intended scope.</p><p>The <i>intended scope</i> is often concretely defined as inter-domain routing policies based on business relationships between Autonomous Systems (ASes). These business relationships <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/974527\">are broadly classified into four categories</a>: customers, transit providers, peers and siblings, although more complex arrangements are possible.</p><p>In a customer-provider relationship the customer AS has an agreement with another network to transit its traffic to the global routing table. In a peer-to-peer relationship two ASes agree to free bilateral traffic exchange, but only between their own IPs and the IPs of their customers. Finally, ASes that belong under the same administrative entity are considered siblings, and their traffic exchange is often unrestricted.  The image below illustrates how the three main relationship types translate to export policies.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3XAOHLT8UtzkLQigSbcrUd/34f8de710fcdda2c4feb7fd1eaaec576/image7-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1653\" height=\"738\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>By categorizing the types of AS-level relationships and their implications on the propagation of BGP routes, we can define multiple phases of a prefix origination announcements during propagation:</p><ul><li><p>upward: all path segments during this phase are <b>customer to provider</b></p></li><li><p>peering: one peer-peer path segment</p></li><li><p>downward: all path segments during this phase are <b>provider to customer</b></p></li></ul><p>An AS path that follows <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6363987\"><b>valley-free routing principle</b></a> will have <b>upward, peering, downward</b> phases, <b>all optional</b> but have to be <b>in that order</b>.

As mentioned previously, the key to having low false positives for detecting route leaks with the valley-free model is to have accurate AS-level relationships. While those relationship types are not publicized by every AS, there have been over two <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6027863\">decades of research</a> on the inference of the relationship types using publicly observed BGP data.</p><p>While state-of-the-art relationship inference algorithms have been shown to be <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2504730.2504735\">highly accurate</a>, even a small margin of errors can still incur inaccuracies in the detection of route leaks. To alleviate such artifacts, we synthesize multiple data sources for inferring AS-level relationships, including <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/\">CAIDA/UCSD</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-relationships/\">AS relationship</a> data and our in-house built AS relationship dataset. Building on top of the two AS-level relationships, we create a much more granular dataset at the per-prefix and per-peer levels. The improved dataset allows us to answer the question like what is the relationship between AS1 and AS2 with respect to prefix P observed by collector peer X. This eliminates much of the ambiguity for cases where networks have multiple different relationships based on prefixes and geo-locations, and thus helps us reduce the number of false positives in the system. Besides the AS-relationships datasets, we also apply the <a href=\"https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/documentation#AS_dependency\">AS Hegemony dataset</a> from <a href=\"https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/\">IHR IIJ</a> to further reduce false positives.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"route-leak-storage-and-presentation\">Route leak storage and presentation</h3>\n      <a href=\"#route-leak-storage-and-presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>After processing each BGP message, we store the generated route leak entries in a database for long-term storage and exploration.

More features like a global view page, route leak notifications, more advanced APIs, custom automations scripts, and historical archive datasets will begin to ship on Cloudflare Radar over time. Your feedback and suggestions are also very important for us to continue improving on our detection results and serve better data to the public.</p><p>Furthermore, we will continue to expand our work on other important topics of Internet routing security, including global BGP hijack detection (not limited to our customer networks), RPKI validation monitoring, open-sourcing tools and architecture designs, and centralized routing security web gateway. Our goal is to provide the best data and tools for routing security to the communities so that we can build a better and more secure Internet together.</p><p>In the meantime, we opened a <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/595317990191398933/1035553707116478495\">Radar room</a> on our Developers Discord Server. Feel free to <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/595317990191398933/1035553707116478495\">join</a> and talk to us; the team is eager to receive feedback and answer questions.</p><p>Visit <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> for more Internet insights.
