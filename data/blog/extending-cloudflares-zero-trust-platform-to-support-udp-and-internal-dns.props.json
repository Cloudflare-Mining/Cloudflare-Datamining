Using Cloudflare Tunnel on the server side, and Cloudflare WARP on the client side, the need for a legacy VPN was eliminated. Fast-forward to today, and thousands of organizations have gone on this journey with us — unplugging their legacy VPN concentrators, internal firewalls, and load balancers. They’ve eliminated the need to maintain all this legacy hardware; they’ve dramatically improved speeds for end users; and they’re able to maintain Zero Trust rules organization-wide.</p><p>We started with TCP, which is powerful because it enables an important range of use cases. However, to truly replace a VPN, you need to be able to cover UDP, too. Starting today, we’re excited to provide early access to UDP on Cloudflare’s Zero Trust platform. And even better: as a result of supporting UDP, we can offer Internal DNS — so there’s no need to migrate thousands of private hostnames by hand to override DNS rules. You can get started with Cloudflare for Teams for free today by signing up <a href=\"https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/teams\">here</a>; and if you’d like to join the waitlist to gain early access to UDP and Internal DNS, please visit <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com/zero-trust/lp/private-dns-waitlist\">here</a>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"the-topology-of-a-private-network-on-cloudflare\">The topology of a private network on Cloudflare</h2>\n      <a href=\"#the-topology-of-a-private-network-on-cloudflare\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Building out a private network has two primary components: the infrastructure side, and the client side.</p><p>The infrastructure side of the equation is powered by Cloudflare Tunnel, which simply connects your infrastructure (whether that be a singular application, many applications, or an entire <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-network-segmentation/\">network segment</a>) to Cloudflare. This is made possible by running a simple command-line daemon in your environment to establish multiple secure, outbound-only, load-balanced links to Cloudflare. Simply put, Tunnel is what connects your network to Cloudflare.</p><p>On the other side of this equation, we need your end users to be able to easily connect to Cloudflare and, more importantly, your network. This connection is handled by our robust device client, <a href=\"/warp-for-desktop/\">Cloudflare WARP</a>. This client can be rolled out to your entire organization in just a few minutes using your in-house MDM tooling, and it establishes a secure, WireGuard-based connection from your users’ devices to the Cloudflare network.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2m1z6HnFMDxGRFpphnS5kB/6a2cf02939d4a1e9b3f8829c9fcc656f/image1-36.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"951\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Now that we have your infrastructure and your users connected to Cloudflare, it becomes easy to tag your applications and layer on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust security controls</a> to verify both identity and device-centric rules for each and every request on your network.</p><p>Up until now though, only TCP was supported.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"extending-cloudflare-zero-trust-to-support-udp\">Extending Cloudflare Zero Trust to support UDP</h2>\n      <a href=\"#extending-cloudflare-zero-trust-to-support-udp\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Over the past year, with more and more users adopting Cloudflare’s Zero Trust platform, we have gathered data surrounding all the use cases that are keeping VPNs plugged in.

Without it, many applications would be rendered woefully inadequate for modern use. Applications which depend on near real time communication such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/solutions/live-streaming/\">video streaming</a> or VoIP services are prime examples of why we need UDP and the role it fills for the Internet. At their core, however, TCP and UDP achieve the same results — just through vastly different means. Each has their own unique benefits and drawbacks, which are always felt downstream by the applications that utilize them.</p><p>Here’s a quick example of how they both work, if you were to ask a question to somebody as a metaphor. TCP should look pretty familiar: you would typically say hi, wait for them to say hi back, ask how they are, wait for their response, and then ask them what you want.</p><p>UDP, on the other hand, is the equivalent of just walking up to someone and asking what you want without checking to make sure that they&#39;re listening. With this approach, some of your question may be missed, but that&#39;s fine as long as you get an answer.</p><p>Like the conversation above, with UDP many applications actually don’t care if some data gets lost; video streaming or game servers are good examples here. If you were to lose a packet in transit while streaming, you wouldn’t want the entire stream to be interrupted until this packet is received — you’d rather just drop the packet and move on. Another reason application developers may utilize UDP is because they’d prefer to develop their own controls around connection, transmission, and quality control rather than use TCP’s standardized ones.</p><p>For Cloudflare, end-to-end support for UDP-based traffic will unlock a number of new use cases. Here are a few we think you’ll agree are pretty exciting.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"internal-dns-resolvers\">Internal DNS Resolvers</h3>\n      <a href=\"#internal-dns-resolvers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Most corporate networks require an internal DNS resolver to disseminate access to resources made available over their Intranet. Your Intranet needs an internal DNS resolver for many of the same reasons the Internet needs public DNS resolvers. In short, humans are good at many things, but remembering long strings of numbers (in this case IP addresses) is not one of them. Both public and internal DNS resolvers were designed to solve this problem (and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/\">much more</a>) for us.</p><p>In the corporate world, it would be needlessly painful to ask internal users to navigate to, say, 192.168.0.1 to simply reach Sharepoint or OneDrive. Instead, it’s much easier to create DNS entries for each resource and let your internal resolver handle all the mapping for your users as this is something humans are actually quite good at.</p><p>Under the hood, DNS queries generally consist of a single UDP request from the client. The server can then return a single reply to the client. Since DNS requests are not very large, they can often be sent and received in a single packet. This makes support for UDP across our Zero Trust platform a key enabler to pulling the plug on your VPN.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"thick-client-applications\">Thick Client Applications</h3>\n      <a href=\"#thick-client-applications\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Another common use case for UDP is thick client applications. One benefit of UDP we have discussed so far is that it is a lean protocol. It’s lean because the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/\">three-way handshake</a> of TCP and other measures for reliability have been stripped out by design. In many cases, application developers still want these reliability controls, but are intimately familiar with their applications and know these controls could be better handled by tailoring them to their application. These thick client applications often perform critical business functions and must be supported end-to-end to migrate. As an example, legacy versions of Outlook may be implemented through thick clients where most of the operations are performed by the local machine, and only the sync interactions with Exchange servers occur over UDP.</p><p>Again, UDP support on our Zero Trust platform now means these types of applications are no reason to remain on your legacy VPN.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"and-more\">And more…</h3>\n      <a href=\"#and-more\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>A huge portion of the world&#39;s Internet traffic is transported over UDP.

This policy can be created under Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Device Enrollment.
