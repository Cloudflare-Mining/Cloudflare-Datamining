	<p>CloudFlare launched at TechCrunch Disrupt <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/reflections-on-techcrunch-disrupt-launch">eight months ago</a> in San Francisco. It was an exciting time for our entire team and early supporters. So, when we got the invitation to talk about our progress at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York City, it felt only right to launch something new once again. This time, it's <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/" target="_blank">CloudFlare Apps</a>, which makes installing web applications fast, safe and one-click simple.</p>
	<p><em>(Actually, we're launching two new services...read about Rocket Loader too.)</em></p>
	<h3 id="whatstheproblem">What's The Problem?</h3>
	<p>We surveyed more than 500 website owners and found that 90 percent of them are concerned about the performance impact of web applications and widgets they install on their site, and 83 percent said they worried about security risks from installed web applications.</p>
	<p>Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) said they hesitated before installing a web application that required them to insert a line of JavaScript or otherwise modify their code.</p>
	<p>Despite these concerns, nearly 100 percent of surveyed webmasters say they want the features web apps bring to their sites.</p>
	<h3 id="wecanhelp">We Can Help</h3>
	<p>Our goal was clear: make useful web applications a no-brainer to add to your website.</p>
	<p>We had a test case already, with Google Analytics, where a single click in the CloudFlare Dashboard gives more complete coverage, faster loading, correct tag placement, and enhancements <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/google-analytics-now-with-site-speed">without touching the code</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="theresult">The Result</h3>
	<p>With CloudFlare Apps, those same benefits are delivered for applications of every kind imaginable.</p>
	<p>CloudFlare Apps allow web applications to be activated through<br>
		CloudFlare without requiring code changes, and we work with the<br>
		application providers to ensure CloudFlare Apps perform as well as<br>
		possible and do not create conflicts with other code. All Apps are<br>
		automatically updated to the latest version without the website owner needing to make a change.</p>
	<h3 id="anappaday">An App A Day</h3>
	<p>Starting on <strong>Wednesday, June 1</strong>, CloudFlare will introduce a new App each day, available for immediate integration for all sites on the CloudFlare network. We'll tell you more about each App here on our blog, on <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudFlare" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, on<br>
		<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CloudFlare" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and in <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/" target="_blank">CloudFlare<br>
			Apps</a>.
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>We've been playing with several of these Apps already, and we think
		you're going to enjoy June as much as we are.</p>
	<h3>It Takes Two (Actually, Way More Than That)</h3>
	<p>We can't do this alone.</p>
	<p>Many of the web's leading application providers are ready to welcome
		CloudFlare customers with a simple click in the CloudFlare Dashboard.
