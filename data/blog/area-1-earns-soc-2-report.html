	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security" target="_blank">Cloudflare Area 1</a> is a cloud-native email security service that identifies and blocks attacks before they hit user inboxes, enabling more effective protection against <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/spear-phishing" target="_blank">spear phishing</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec" target="_blank">Business Email Compromise</a> (BEC), and other advanced threats. Cloudflare Area 1 is part of the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/zero-trust-hub" target="_blank">Cloudflare Zero Trust platform</a> and an essential component of a modern security and compliance strategy, helping organizations to reduce their attackers surface, detect and respond to threats faster, and improve compliance with industry regulations and security standards.</p>
	<p>This announcement is another step in our commitment to remaining strong in our security posture.</p>
	<h2 id="our-soc-2-journey">Our SOC 2 Journey</h2>
	<p>Many customers want assurance that the sensitive information they send to us can be kept safe. One of the best ways to provide this assurance is a <a href="https://us.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/serviceorganization-smanagement" target="_blank">SOC 2 Type II report</a>. We decided to obtain the report as it is the best way for us to demonstrate the controls we have in place to keep Cloudflare Area 1 and its infrastructure secure and available. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Cloudflare Area 1’s SOC 2 Type II report covers a 3 month period from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2023. Our auditors assessed the operating effectiveness of the 70 controls we’ve implemented to meet the <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/2017-trust-services-criteria-with-revised-points-of-focus-2022" target="_blank">Trust Services Criteria</a> for Security, Confidentiality, and Availability.</p>
	<p>We anticipate that the next ask from our customers will be for a SOC 2 Type II report that covers a longer reporting period, so we’ve decided to expand our scope for the Cloudflare Global Cloud Platform SOC 2 Type II report to be inclusive of Cloudflare Area 1 later on this year. </p>
	<p>We are thrilled to reach this milestone and will continue to stay committed to be one of the most trusted platforms.</p>
	<p>For a copy of Cloudflare Area 1’s SOC 2 Type II report, existing customers can obtain one through the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/access-compliance-docs" target="_blank">Cloudflare Dashboard</a>; new customers may also request a copy from your sales representative.
