<div class="post-content lh-copy gray1">
	<p>This may sound like a weird title, but hear me out. You’d think keepalives would always be helpful, but turns out reality isn’t always what you expect it to be. It really helps if you read <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-sad-state-of-linux-socket-balancing">Why does one NGINX worker take all the load?</a> first. This post is an adaptation of a rather old post on Cloudflare’s internal blog, so not all details are exactly as they are in production today but the lessons are still valid.</p>
	<p>This is a story about how we were seeing some complaints about sporadic latency spikes, made some unconventional changes, and were able to slash the 99.9th latency percentile by 4x!</p>
	<h3>Request flow on Cloudflare edge</h3>
	<p>I'm going to focus only on two parts of our edge stack: FL and SSL.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>FL accepts plain HTTP connections and does the main request logic, including our WAF</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>SSL terminates SSL and passes connections to FL over local Unix socket:</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Here’s a diagram:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

	</figure>
	<p>These days we route all traffic through SSL for simplicity, but in the grand scheme of things it’s not going to matter much.</p>
	<p>Each of these processes is not itself a single process, but rather a main process and a collection of workers that do actual processing. Another diagram for you to make this more visual:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

	</figure>
	<h3>Keepalives</h3>
	<p>Requests come over connections that are reused for performance reasons, which is sometimes referred to as “keepalive”. It's generally expensive for a client to open a new TCP connection and our servers keep some memory pools associated with connections that need to be recycled. In fact, one of the range of mitigations we use for attack traffic is disabling keepalives for abusive clients, forcing them to reopen connections, which slows them down considerably.</p>
	<p>To illustrate the usefulness of keepalives, here's me requesting <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com/</a> from curl over the same connection:</p>
	<pre class="language-rust"><code class="language-rust">$ curl -s -w "Time to connect: %{time_connect} Time to first byte: %{time_starttransfer}\n" -o /dev/null http://example.com/ -o /dev/null http://example.com/

Time to connect: 0.012108 Time to first byte: 0.018724
Time to connect: 0.000019 Time to first byte: 0.007391</code></pre>
	<p>The first request took 18.7ms and out of them 12.1ms were used to establish a new connection, which is not even a TLS one. When I sent another request over the same connection, I didn't need to pay extra and it took just 7.3ms to service my request. That's a big win, which gets even bigger if you need to establish a brand new connection (especially if it’s not <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning-resources/tls-1-3">TLSv1.3</a> or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future">QUIC</a>). DNS was also cached in the example above, but it may be another negative factor for domains with low TTL.</p>
	<p>Keepalives tend to be used extensively, because they seem beneficial. Generally keepalives are enabled by default for this exact reason.</p>
	<h3>Taking all the load</h3>
	<p>Due to how Linux works (see the first link in this blog post), most of the load goes to a few workers out of the pool. When that worker is not able to accept() a pending connection because it's busy processing requests, that connection spills to another worker. The process cascades until some worker is ready to pick up.</p>
	<p>This leaves us with a ladder of load spread between workers:</p>

	<p>More load corresponds to more open sockets. More open sockets generate more load to serve these connections. It’s a vicious circle.</p>
	<h3>The twist</h3>
	<p>Now that we have all these workers holding onto this connections, requests over these connections are also in a way pinned to workers:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

		<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3kvLGjxkG4Rb5l5n7cyawp/89b3155b25f7175fcf3bb217fdbde32a/Screen-Shot-2020-03-19-at-12.23.16.png" alt="" class="kg-image" width="1238" height="504" loading="lazy">

	</figure>
	<p>In FL we're doing some things that are <i>somewhat</i> compute intensive, which means that some workers can be busy for a <i>somewhat</i> prolonged period of time, while other workers will be sitting idle, increasing latency for requests. Ideally we want to always hand over a request to a worker that's idle, because that maximizes our chances of not being blocked, even if it takes a few event loop iterations to serve a request (meaning that we may still block down the road).</p>
	<p>One part of dealing with the issue is <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-problem-with-event-loops">offloading some of the compute intensive parts</a> of the request processing into a thread pool, but that was something that hadn’t happened at that point. We had to do something else in the meantime.</p>
	<p>Clients have no way of knowing that their worker is busy and they should probably ask another worker to serve the connection. For clients over a real network this doesn't even make sense, since by the time their request comes to NGINX up to tens of milliseconds later, the situation will probably be different.</p>
	<p>But our clients are not over a long haul network! They are local and they are SSL connecting over a Unix socket. It's not exactly that expensive to reopen a new connection for each request and what it gives is the ability to pass a fully formed request that's buffered in SSL into FL:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

	</figure>
	<p>Two key points here:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>The request is always picked up by an idle worker</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>The request is readily available for potentially compute intensive processing</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The former is the most important part.</p>
	<h3>Validating the hypothesis</h3>
	<p>To validate this assumption, I wrote the following program:</p>
	<pre class="language-rust"><code class="language-rust">package main
 
import (
    "flag"
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
    "net/http"

    "time"
)
 
func main() {
    u := flag.String("url", "", "url to request")
    p := flag.Duration("pause", 0, "pause between requests")
    t := flag.Duration("threshold", 0, "threshold for reporting")
    c := flag.Int("count", 10000, "number of requests to send")
    n := flag.Int("close", 1, "close connection after every that many requests")
 
    flag.Parse()
 
    if *u == "" {
        flag.PrintDefaults()
        os.Exit(1)
    }
 
    client := http.Client{}
 
    for i := 0; i &lt; *c; i++ {
        started := time.Now()
 
        request, err := http.NewRequest("GET", *u, nil)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatalf("Error constructing request: %s", err)
        }
 
        if i%*n == 0 {
            request.Header.Set("Connection", "Close")
        }
 
        response, err := client.Do(request)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatalf("Error performing request: %s", err)
        }
 
        _, err = ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatalf("Error reading request body: %s", err)
        }
 
        response.Body.Close()
 
        elapsed := time.Since(started)
        if elapsed &gt; *t {
            log.Printf("Request %d took %dms", i, int(elapsed.Seconds()*1000))
        }
 
        time.Sleep(*p)
    }
}</code></pre>
	<p>The program connects to a requested URL and recycles the connection after X requests have completed. We also pause for a short time between requests.</p>
	<p>If we close a connection after every request:</p>
	<pre class="language-rust"><code class="language-rust">$ go run /tmp/main.go -url http://test.domain/cdn-cgi/trace -count 10000 -pause 5ms -threshold 20ms -close 1

	<p>We request an endpoint that's served in FL by Lua, so seeing any slow requests is unfortunate. There's an element of luck in this game and our program sees no cooperation from eyeballs or SSL, so it's somewhat expected.</p>
	<p>Now, if we start closing the connection only after every other request, the situation immediately gets a lot worse:</p>

	<p>If we close after every 5 requests, the number of slow responses almost doubles. This is counter-intuitive, keepalives are supposed to help with latency, not make it worse!</p>
	<h3>Trying this in the wild</h3>
	<p>To see how this works out in the real world, we disabled keepalives between SSL and FL in one location, forcing SSL to send every request over a separate connection (remember: cheap local Unix socket). Here’s how our probes toward that location reacted to this:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

		<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6sRZtAWZEJFfbhGrKwPHdO/fbc317ba5cb7ba553654e722ad0a3148/image5-6.png" alt="" class="kg-image" width="1999" height="1276" loading="lazy">

	</figure>
	<p>Here’s cumulative wait time between SSL and FL:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

		<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2GJzrOfymF20pcJJ3Ey41a/a33804a2fffc71888b061251adab345e/image3-3.png" alt="" class="kg-image" width="1999" height="1276" loading="lazy">

	</figure>
	<p>And finally 99.9th percentile of the same measurement:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

		<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2zP0HjPLzGKswV6w4CP2S/56db92613d38ef337b14706856d35d0a/image1-8.png" alt="" class="kg-image" width="1999" height="1276" loading="lazy">

	</figure>
	<p>This is a huge win.</p>
	<p>Another telling graph is comparing our average “edge processing time” (which includes WAF) in a test location to a global value:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

		<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4n6MYPoNl0vo1y5BVKIKcp/486db0e51698da588cf34f08dea1acb5/image2-5.png" alt="" class="kg-image" width="1999" height="1276" loading="lazy">

	</figure>
	<p>We reduced unnecessary wait time due to an imbalance without increasing the CPU load, which directly translates into improved user experience and lower resource consumption for us.</p>
	<h3>The downsides</h3>
	<p>There has to be a downside from this, right? The problem we introduced is that CPU imbalance between individual CPU cores went up:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

		<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3MSawWBrDEpUIbWHgWpGut/fb6babb98639ea66a198e4cea61ade46/image4-3.png" alt="" class="kg-image" width="1999" height="535" loading="lazy">

	</figure>
	<p>Overall CPU usage did not change, just the distribution of it. We already know of a way of dealing with this: SO_REUSEPORT. Either that or <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/2/17/518">EPOLLROUNDROBIN</a>, which doesn’t have some of the drawbacks of SO_REUSEPORT (which does not work for a Unix socket, for example), but requires a patched kernel. If we combine both disabled keepalives and EPOLLROUNDROBIN changes, we can see CPUs allocated to FL converge in their utilization nicely:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

		<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/zN1XbJxUeCeVx2fyDYljN/24eb2a3b8391551fb4f73b922ddac840/image6-3.png" alt="" class="kg-image" width="1739" height="280" loading="lazy">

	</figure>
	<p>We’ve tried different combinations and having both EPOLLROUNDROBIN with disabled keepalives worked best. Having just one of them is not as beneficial to lower latency.</p>
	<h3>Conclusions</h3>
	<p>We disabled keepalives between SSL and FL running on the same box and this greatly improved our tail latency caused by requests landing on non-optimal FL workers. This was an unexpected fix, but it worked and we are able to explain it.</p>
	<p>This doesn’t mean that you should go and disable keepalives everywhere. Generally keepalives are great and should stay enabled, but in our case the latency of local connection establishment is much lower than the delay we can get from landing on a busy worker.</p>
	<p>In reality this means that we can run our machines hotter and not see latency rise as much as it did before. Imagine moving the CPU cap from 50% to 80% with no effect on latency. The numbers are arbitrary, but the idea holds. Running hotter allows for fewer machines able to serve the same amount of traffic, reducing our overall footprint. ?</p>
