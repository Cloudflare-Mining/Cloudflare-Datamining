So, with that in mind, let’s answer the question: did the 2022 celebrations of the first British monarch with a 70th anniversary on the throne have an impact on the UK’s Internet traffic?</p><p>First, some details about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II#Central_weekend\">Platinum Jubilee</a>. There was a <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/platinum-jubilee-central-weekend#:~:text=To%20celebrate%20this%20unprecedented%20anniversary,2nd%20to%20Sunday%205th%20June.\">four-day bank holiday</a> (June 2-5) in the UK for the celebration that included parades and pageants, and several ceremonies. There was a <a href=\"https://platinumjubilee.gov.uk/get-involved-with-the-platinum-jubilee/\">Big Jubilee Lunch in many communities</a> on Sunday, June 5, and more than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II#Central_weekend\">16,000 street parties</a> (pubs and bars were also allowed to stay open for extra two hours). In events like these, not only there’s a lot to do outside, but also to see on the television and that impacts the Internet — we saw it during the <a href=\"/eurovision-2022-internet-trends/\">Eurovision 2022 final</a>.</p><p>Looking at <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/gb\">Cloudflare Radar’s</a> data from the UK, we can see that this past weekend clearly had less Internet traffic compared to recent weekends, so people were less online during the daytime, when the Jubilee was being celebrated. Here’s the chart with the <b>previous four weekends of the UK’s Internet traffic</b>:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3r0EiGPcWDNFLaUahvB9D8/b42af2237c9d35deff20a012e4259429/image11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"573\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>That lower traffic trend is most clear on Saturday, June 4, at 20:00 local time, when traffic was 23% lower than on the previous Saturday, and on Sunday, June 5, at 15:00, when traffic was 25% lower than on the previous Sunday. The weather was actually sunnier on the previous weekend, May 28-29, but people did seem to have many reasons (related to the Jubilee) to go outside or at least be less online.</p><p>Looking at the full picture of when the <b>four-day bank holiday</b> started, Thursday, June 2, 2022, until Sunday, June 5, there’s a clear trend of less traffic through all of those days, which is not unusual, at least for Thursday and Friday, considering that holidays usually have traffic more similar to weekends than weekdays.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/52Jb3Yut2kr1aeRTMs704W/3e02e721071cf3a1bb27135db64bd57f/image6-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"768\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>No surprise, when there’s a holiday, or it’s the weekend people tend to use their mobile devices more to access the Internet, and that was clearly what we saw in the <b>UK</b> since Thursday, June 2, <b>mobile traffic</b> (green line) was always prevalent <b>compared to desktop traffic</b> (blue line) since then.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3zocqgCNIPRtCiekvNjOGM/bd023f9efeb98d16d0236c4ebb78d0b9/image4-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"584\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>On the weekdays before June 2, we can see that Internet traffic by mobile devices only stands out after 18:00 (before that, with people working, desktop took the lead).</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"from-canada-to-new-zealand\">From Canada to New Zealand</h3>\n      <a href=\"#from-canada-to-new-zealand\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>There are several other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations\">commonwealth</a> countries that also had relevant events to celebrate since June 2 and through the past weekend for the Queen’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II#Central_weekend\">Platinum Jubilee</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II#Canada\">Canada</a> is one with several <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canada-celebrates-final-days-of-queens-platinum-jubilee-festivities-2/\">activities</a> throughout the country, including free admission to museums and historic sites, park parties and concerts.</p><p>Related to the Jubilee celebrations or not, <b>Internet traffic in Canada</b> was lower this past weekend than in the previous one. Saturday, June 4, at 22:00 in Toronto traffic was 13% lower than in the previous period, and throughout the day that was also the case.

First, we can see that <b>websites concerning the UK Royal family and the Jubilee</b> were clearly seeing more traffic after Wednesday, June 1 (the day before the four-day bank holiday). The three biggest spikes were: Wednesday evening, when traffic was 777% higher at 22:00 (compared to the previous week); the next morning (08:00), when it rose 1060%; and on Saturday evening (21:00) it got 1043% more traffic.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7i4iUOfUqpZaw37UcZi7ix/214632e81ac5560ff460189c5c6aa441/image1-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"857\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>UK-based news websites (TV broadcasters and newspapers) also covered Queen Elizabeth II&#39;s Platinum Jubilee extensively over the extended weekend. And there are three big highlights/spikes from the past few days regarding <b>media outlets&#39; websites</b>, but only two seem to be related to the Jubilee or the bank holidays.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/37n19JDOw6ZX20F1g4Gd4O/c60b27baba158ee0776ef6d1b1c6700e/image3-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"678\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We can see that the biggest spike in traffic (75% more than the previous period) was the night before the Jubilee four-day bank holiday started. Then, Sunday afternoon when the London Jubilee Pageant was ending, there was another spike (25% higher).</p><p>But the day with more sustained traffic from the last 14 days was actually Monday, June 6.
