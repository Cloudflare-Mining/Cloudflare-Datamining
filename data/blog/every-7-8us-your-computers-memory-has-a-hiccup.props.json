You see, each bit of data is stored by the charge (or lack of it) on a tiny capacitor within the RAM chip. But these capacitors gradually lose their charge over time. To avoid losing the stored data, they must regularly get refreshed to restore the charge (if present) to its original level. This <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_refresh\">refresh process</a> involves reading the value of every bit and then writing it back.

This presentation from <a href=\"https://pubweb.eng.utah.edu/~cs7810/pres/11-7810-12.pdf\">the University of Utah explains the nomenclature</a>. You can check the configuration of memory in your computer with <code>decode-dimms</code> command. Here&#39;s an example:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ decode-dimms\nSize                                       4096 MB\nBanks x Rows x Columns x Bits              8 x 15 x 10 x 64\nRanks                                      2</pre></code>\n            <p>For today we don&#39;t need to get into the whole DDR DIMM layout, we just need to understand a single memory cell, storing one bit of information. Specifically we are only interested in how the refresh process is performed.</p><p>Let&#39;s review two sources:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"http://utaharch.blogspot.com/2013/11/a-dram-refresh-tutorial.html\">A DRAM Refresh Tutorial, from the University of Utah</a></p></li><li><p>And an awesome documentation of 1 gigabit cell from micron: <a href=\"https://www.micron.com/~/media/documents/products/technical-note/dram/tn4609.pdf\">TN-46-09 Designing for 1Gb DDR SDRAM</a></p></li></ul><p>Each bit stored in dynamic memory must be refreshed, typically every 64ms (called Static Refresh). This is a rather costly operation. To avoid one major stall every 64ms, this process is divided into 8192 smaller refresh operations. In each operation, the computer’s memory controller sends refresh commands to the DRAM chips. After receiving the instruction a chip will refresh 1/8192 of its cells. Doing the math - 64ms / 8192 = 7812.5 ns or 7.81 μs. This means:</p><ul><li><p>A refresh command is issued every 7812.5 ns. This is called tREFI.</p></li><li><p>It takes some time for the chip to perform the refresh and recover so it can perform normal read and write operations again. This time, called tRFC is either 75ns or 120ns (as per the mentioned Micron datasheet).</p></li></ul><p>When the memory is hot (&gt;85C) the memory retention time drops and the static refresh time halves to 32ms, and tREFI falls to 3906.25 ns.</p><p>A typical memory chip is busy with refreshes for a significant fraction of its running time - between 0.4% to 5%. Furthermore, memory chips are responsible for a nontrivial share of typical computer&#39;s power draw, and large chunk of that power is spent on performing the refreshes.</p><p>For the duration of the refresh action, the whole memory chip is blocked. This means each and every bit in memory is blocked for more than 75ns every 7812ns. Let&#39;s measure this.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"preparing-an-experiment\">Preparing an experiment</h2>\n            <a href=\"#preparing-an-experiment\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>To measure operations with nanosecond granularity we must write a tight loop, perhaps in C.

Since we want to find a fixed-interval event, we can feed the data into the FFT (fast fourier transform) algorithm, which deciphers the underlying frequencies.</p><p>I&#39;m not the first one to think about this - Mark Seaborn of Rowhammer fame <a href=\"https://github.com/google/rowhammer-test/blob/master/refresh_timing/refresh_timing.cc\">implemented this very technique</a> back in 2015. Even after peeking at Mark&#39;s code, getting FFT to work turned out to be harder than I anticipated. But finally I got all the pieces together.</p><p>First we need to prepare the data. FFT requires input data to be sampled with a constant sampling interval. We also want to crop the data to reduce noise. By trial and error I found the best results are when data is preprocessed:</p><ul><li><p>Small (smaller than average * 1.8) values of loop iterations are cut out, ignored, and replaced with readings of &quot;0&quot;. We really don&#39;t want to feed the noise into the algorithm.</p></li><li><p>All the remaining readings are replaced with &quot;1&quot;, since we really don&#39;t care about the amplitude of the delay caused by some noise.</p></li><li><p>I settled on sampling interval of 100ns, but any number up to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem\">a Nyquist value (double expected frequency) also work fine</a>.</p></li><li><p>The data needs to be sampled with fixed timings before feeding to FFT. All reasonable sampling methods work ok, I ended up doing basic linear interpolation.</p></li></ul><p>The algorithm is roughly:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">UNIT=100ns\nA = [(timestamp, loop_duration),...] \np = 1\nfor curr_ts in frange(fist_ts, last_ts, UNIT):\n    while not(A[p-1].timestamp &lt;= curr_ts &lt; A[p].timestamp):\n        p += 1\n    v1 = 1 if avg*1.8 &lt;= A[p-1].duration &lt;= avg*4 else 0\n    v2 = 1 if avg*1.8 &lt;= A[p].duration &lt;= avg*4 else 0\n    v = estimate_linear(v1, v2, A[p-1].timestamp, curr_ts, A[p].timestamp)\n    B.append( v )</pre></code>\n            <p>Which on my data produces fairly boring vector like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \n 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,\n 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \n 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]</pre></code>\n            <p>The vector is pretty long though, typically about ~200k data points. With data prepared like this, we are ready to feed it into FFT!</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">C = numpy.fft.fft(B)\nC = numpy.abs(C)\nF = numpy.fft.fftfreq(len(B)) * (1000000000/UNIT)</pre></code>\n            <p>Pretty simple, right? This produces two vectors:</p><ul><li><p>C contains complex numbers of the frequency components. We are not interested in complex numbers and we can flatten them out by calling <code>abs()</code>.</p></li><li><p>F contains labels to what frequency bin lies in which place in vector C. We need to normalize it to Hz - by multiplying it by the input vector sampling frequency.</p></li></ul><p>The result can be charted:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7GN44y65zWWJhSV8uNzqnu/6cdea110f7a5b39cc3a3592f6be9915a/fft1a.png\" alt=\"fft1a\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1893\" height=\"824\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Y axis is unit-less since we normalized the delay times.

Instead of trying to figure something out with naked eye, we can always employ good old FFT. Some wishful thinking is needed when preparing the data.</p><p>Most importantly, we showed it&#39;s often possible to measure subtle hardware behaviours from a simple userspace process. This kind of thinking led to the discovery of <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html\">the original Rowhammer</a> vulnerability, was used in Meltdown/Spectre attacks and showed again in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/potentially-disastrous-rowhammer-bitflips-can-bypass-ecc-protections/\">recent ECC-defeating reincarnation of Rowhammer</a>.</p><p>There is so much more to be said. We barely scratched the surface of the inner workings of the memory subsystem.
