Like many of our best products, it started by solving an internal issue we had. Cloudflare has several mission-critical domains. If the registration of these domains were ever compromised, it would be, in a word, bad.</p><p>For years, we worked with our original domain registrar to ensure these domains were as locked down as possible. Unfortunately, in 2013, a hacker was able to compromise several of the systems of the registrar we used and come perilously close to taking over some of our domains.</p><p>That began a process of us looking for a better registrar. Unfortunately, even the registrars that charge hefty premiums and promise to be very secure turn out to have pretty lousy security. We ultimately decided the only way to get the level of security we needed was to build a registrar ourselves.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"custom-domain-protection-for-the-ultra-high-end\">Custom Domain Protection for the Ultra High End</h3>\n      <a href=\"#custom-domain-protection-for-the-ultra-high-end\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>A handful of our customers noticed we had our own registrar and asked us about it. Those conversations turned into our Enterprise Registrar product with Custom Domain Protection for our most security-conscious clients. Every client using Custom Domain Protection defines their own process for updating records. For instance, if a Custom Domain Protection client wants us to not change their DNS records unless 6 different individuals call us, in order, from a set of predefined phone numbers, each reading multiple unique pass codes, and telling us their favorite ice cream flavor, on a Tuesday that is also a full moon, we will enforce that.

(If you&#39;re interested you can learn more about it <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/custom-domain-protection\">here</a>.) Running that, however, has helped us define a set of best practices that we think every registrar should follow.

Two phrases kept coming up: &quot;bait and switch&quot; and “endless upsell.” If you&#39;ve ever registered a domain, you know the drill. You get a discounted price when you first register, but with each renewal the price soars. In the best cases we&#39;ve found, it&#39;s around two times the original offer. In the worst, it&#39;s more than twenty times. It&#39;s gross. That’s in addition to the constant upsells for other products that either should be included for free (for example, DNSSEC) or that you just don’t want (for example, worthless trusted site seals).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1ldnIZg9D20y6lQuHG2k5g/7e85756c2417026435ed88f762245fdf/registrar-hidden-fees_2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1736\" height=\"1428\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The thing is, registering a domain is a commodity. There&#39;s no meaningful difference between any of the existing mass market registrars. Each <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/top-level-domain/\">top level domain</a> registry (TLDs like .com .org .info .io, etc) sets a wholesale price for registering a domain under them. These prices are known and remain relatively consistent over time. All the registrar does is record you as the owner of a particular domain. That just involves sending some commands to an API. In other words, domain registrars are charging you for being a middle-man and delivering essentially no value to justify their markup. The more we looked at it, the more crazy the whole market looked to us.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"learning-from-making-ssl-free\">Learning from Making SSL Free</h3>\n      <a href=\"#learning-from-making-ssl-free\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The last time we saw a market as messed up as this was when we looked into the market for SSL certificates. Back in 2014, we decided it was crazy that people should have to pay to be encrypted online. During our Birthday Week celebrations that year, we became one of the first services to say that you should get encryption at no extra cost, even on our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/\">free plan</a>. Since then there&#39;s been an encryption revolution, and we&#39;re proud that nearly all forward-thinking services offer SSL for free. If some service you&#39;re using still charges you extra to support encryption they’re ripping you off.</p><p>Granted, the economics of registering a domain are a bit different, but only a bit. TLDs need to do some work to make sure no two people register the same domain. And it makes sense for there to be some cost to keep someone from just registering every possible combination of characters. But why should registrars charge any markup over what the TLDs charge? That seemed as nutty to us as certificate authorities charging to run a bit of math. When we see a broken market on the Internet we like to do something about it.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-cloudflare-registrar-promise\">The Cloudflare Registrar Promise</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-cloudflare-registrar-promise\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Today, on Cloudflare’s 8th birthday, we’re giving all our customers a present: a registrar they can love.</p><p>Here&#39;s the promise of the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/\">Cloudflare Registrar</a>: we&#39;ll follow the best possible security practices and offer you the best possible price.

Just as we want to thank and reward our most tenured customers, we also want to help support those organizations that are attempting to make a meaningful difference in our industry.  One such organization is <a href=\"https://girlswhocode.com/\">Girls Who Code</a>, which aims to help close the gender gap in the technology industry.  To support this organization’s efforts, we’re inviting customers to make a contribution to Girls Who Code during the Early Access registration process, and those who do will move to the front of our Early Access invitation queue.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"welcoming-everyone-to-a-registrar-you-can-love\">Welcoming Everyone to a Registrar You Can Love</h3>\n      <a href=\"#welcoming-everyone-to-a-registrar-you-can-love\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We estimate that if every one of our customers moved their domains to the Cloudflare Registrar, they’d save over $50 million per year.</p><p>Combined with our Bandwidth Alliance announcement yesterday, we hope the announcements this Birthday Week will save our customers well over $100 million per year they’d been paying for their infrastructure before.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3xrnVUtRQKG1jdoO218hag/04e8a2a64adaa54512dd6751db7462e5/cloudflare-promise_2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1284\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>If you&#39;re not yet a Cloudflare customer, but you want to use Cloudflare Registrar, we encourage you to sign up for our core service now.
