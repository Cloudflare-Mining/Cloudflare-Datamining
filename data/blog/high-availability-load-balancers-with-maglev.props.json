This allows us to support servers that require client IP addresses as part of their operation, without workarounds such as X-Forwarded-For headers or the PROXY TCP extension.</p></li><li><p>Support an architecture where backends are located across many racks and subnets.

We found that communication between load balancers significantly increased the system complexity, allowing for more opportunities for things to go wrong.</p></li><li><p>Allow for staged rollout from the previous load balancer implementation.

Our routers choose which load balancers will receive packets based on a routing strategy called equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP).</p><p>ECMP hashes information from packets to pick a path for that packet. The hash function used by routers is often fixed in firmware. Routers that chose a poor hashing function, or chose bad inputs, can create unbalanced network and server load, or break assumptions made by the protocol layer.</p><p>We worked with our networking team to ensure ECMP is configured on our routers to hash only based on the packet&#39;s 5-tuple—the protocol, source address and port, and destination address and port.</p><p>For maintenance, our operators can withdraw the BGP session and traffic will transparently shift to other load balancers. However, if a load balancer suddenly becomes unavailable, such as with a kernel panic or power failure, there is a short delay before the BGP keepalive mechanism fails and routers terminate the session.</p><p>It&#39;s possible for routers to terminate BGP sessions after a much shorter delay using the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol between the router and load balancers. Different routers have different limitations and restrictions on BFD that makes it difficult to use in an environment heavily using L2 link aggregation and VXLANs.</p><p>We&#39;re continuing to work with our networking team to find solutions to reduce the time to terminate BGP sessions, using tools and configurations they&#39;re most comfortable with.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"selecting-backends-with-maglev\">Selecting Backends with Maglev</h3>\n            <a href=\"#selecting-backends-with-maglev\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>To ensure all load balancers are sending traffic to the same backends, we decided to use the <a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub44824/\">Maglev connection scheduler</a>. Maglev is a consistent hash scheduler hashing a 5-tuple of information from each packet—the protocol, source address and port, and destination address and port—to determine a backend server.</p><p>By being a consistent hash, the same backend server is chosen by every load balancer for a packet without needing to persist any connection state. This allows us to transparently move traffic between load balancers without requiring explicit connection synchronization between them.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"ipvs-and-foo-over-udp\">IPVS and Foo-Over-UDP</h3>\n            <a href=\"#ipvs-and-foo-over-udp\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Where possible, we wanted to use commonplace and reliable Linux features. Linux has implemented a powerful layer 4 load balancer, the IP Virtual Server (IPVS), since the early 2000s. IPVS has supported the Maglev scheduler <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=039f32e8cdea29b4d0680df7a83817b5ec4166e1\">since Linux 4.18</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2FK6ZVvqjjOVdFwdvTZM3L/5617f15dd5cf447bff3a47e7dff5702f/image2-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"843\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Our load balancer and application servers are spread across multiple racks and subnets. To route traffic from the load balancer we opted to use Foo-Over-UDP encapsulation.</p><p>In Foo-Over-UDP encapsulation a new IP and UDP header are added around the original packet. When these packets arrive on the destination server, the Linux kernel removes the outer IP and UDP headers and inserts the inner payload back into the networking stack for processing as if the packet had originally been received on that server.</p><p>Compared to other encapsulation methods—such as IPIP, GUE, and GENEVE—we felt Foo-Over-UDP struck a nice balance between features and flexibility. Direct Server Return, where application servers reply directly to clients and bypass the load balancers, was implemented as a byproduct of the encapsulation. There was no state associated with the encapsulation, each server only required one encapsulation interface to receive traffic from all load balancers.</p><p><b>Example Load Balancer Configuration</b></p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"># Load in the kernel modules required for IPVS and FOU.\n$ modprobe ip_vs &amp;&amp; modprobe ip_vs_mh &amp;&amp; modprobe fou\n\n# Create one tunnel between the load balancer and\n# an application server.

To work around this limitation, we&#39;ve created virtual interfaces that implement Foo-Over-UDP encapsulation. We can then use IPVS&#39;s direct packet forwarding method along with the kernel routing table to choose a specific interface.</p><p>Linux is often configured to ignore packets that arrive on an interface that is different from the interface used for replies. As packets will now be arriving on the virtual &quot;tunl0&quot; interface, we need to disable reverse path filtering on this interface. The kernel uses the higher value of the named and &quot;all&quot; interfaces, so you may need to decrease &quot;all&quot; and adjust other interfaces.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"mtus-and-encapsulation\">MTUs and Encapsulation</h3>\n            <a href=\"#mtus-and-encapsulation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The maximum IPv4 packet size, or maximum transmission unit (MTU), we accept from the internet is 1500 bytes.
