Not only that, the more listening sockets there are, the longer the chains in the socket lookup hash table. We have learned the hard way that going in this direction <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/revenge-listening-sockets/\">can hurt packet processing latency</a>.</p><p>The sockets API comes with a big hammer that can make our life easier - the <code>INADDR_ANY</code> aka <code>0.0.0.0</code> wildcard address. With <code>INADDR_ANY</code> we can make a single socket receive on all addresses assigned to our host, specifying just the port.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)\ns.bind((&#039;0.0.0.0&#039;, 12345))\ns.listen(16)</pre></code>\n            <p></p><p>Quick Quiz #2: Is there another way to bind a socket to all local addresses? <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/its-crowded-in-here/#quiz-2\">Jump to answer</a>.</p><p>In other words, compared to the naive “one address, one socket” approach, <code>INADDR_ANY</code> allows us to have a single catch-all listening socket for the whole IP range on which we accept incoming connections.</p><p>On Linux this is possible thanks to a two-phase listening socket lookup, where it falls back to search for an <code>INADDR_ANY</code> socket if a more specific match has not been found.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1B0Td9aV8dFNmmOZ7Z5Ell/6445f27baa73009fb9ce4c5e1ea02e1e/tcp_socket_lookup-1.png\" alt=\"tcp socket lookup-1\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"406\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Another upside of binding to <code>0.0.0.0</code> is that our application doesn’t need to be aware of what addresses we have assigned to our host. We are also free to assign or remove the addresses after binding the listening socket. No need to reconfigure the service when its listening IP range changes.</p><p>On the other hand if our service should be listening on just <code>A.B.C.0/20</code> prefix, binding to all local addresses is more than we need. We might unintentionally expose an otherwise internal-only service to external traffic without a proper firewall or a socket filter in place.</p><p>Then there is the security angle. Since we now only have one socket, attacks attempting to flood any of the IPs assigned to our host on our service’s port, will hit the catch-all socket and its receive queue. While in such circumstances the Linux <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/syn-packet-handling-in-the-wild/\">TCP stack has your back</a>, UDP needs special care or legitimate traffic might drown in the flood of dropped packets.</p><p>Possibly the biggest downside, though, is that a service listening on the wildcard <code>INADDR_ANY</code> address claims the port number exclusively for itself. Binding over the wildcard-listening socket with a specific IP and port fails miserably due to the address already being taken (<code>EADDRINUSE</code>).</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(12345), sin_addr=inet_addr(&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;)}, 16) = 0\nbind(4, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(12345), sin_addr=inet_addr(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)}, 16) = -1 EADDRINUSE (Address already in use)\n</pre></code>\n            <p>Unless your service is UDP-only, setting the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> socket option, will not help you overcome this restriction. The only way out is to turn to <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>, normally used to construct a load-balancing socket group. And that is only if you are lucky enough to run the port-conflicting services as the same user (UID). That is a story for another post.Quick Quiz #3: Does setting the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> socket option have any effect at all when there is bind conflict? <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/its-crowded-in-here/#quiz-3\">Jump to answer</a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"life-gets-real-one-port-two-services\">Life gets real - one port, two services</h2>\n            <a href=\"#life-gets-real-one-port-two-services\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>As it happens, at the Cloudflare edge we do host services that share the same port number but otherwise respond to requests on non-overlapping IP ranges.

There is no counterpart of <code>INADDR_ANY</code>, a wildcard value to select all ports (<code>INPORT_ANY</code>?).To achieve what we wanted, we had to turn to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-spectrum/\">TPROXY</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/tproxy.txt\">Netfilter / <code>iptables</code> extension</a> designed for intercepting remote-destined traffic on the forward path.

What is socket lookup? It’s a stage on the receive path where the transport layer searches for a socket to dispatch the packet to. The last possible moment to steer packets before they land in the selected socket receive queue. In there we attach a new type of BPF program called <code>inet_lookup</code>.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2yATE46s8d1no0gYCw6Asw/25c696940ef90452dd47a1ae4ebfd740/tcp_socket_lookup_with_bpf-1.png\" alt=\"tcp socket lookup with bpf-1\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"635\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>If you recall, socket lookup in the Linux TCP stack is a <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4-rc2/source/include/net/inet_hashtables.h#L329\">two phase process</a>. First the kernel will try to find an established (connected) socket matching the packet 4-tuple. If there isn’t one, it will continue by looking for a listening socket using just the packet 2-tuple as key.</p><p>Our proposed extension allows users to program the second phase, the listening socket lookup. If present, a BPF program is allowed to choose a listening socket and terminate the lookup. Our program is also free to ignore the packet, in which case the kernel will continue to look for a listening socket as usual.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/bjoj0UUcthGLLGOSTbida/2b81afdec3428fe3af8980bc4389910a/bpf_inet_lookup_operation-1.png\" alt=\"bpf inet lookup operation-1\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"919\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>How does this new type of BPF program operate? On input, as context, it gets handed a subset of information extracted from packet headers, including the packet 4-tuple. Based on the input the program accesses a BPF map containing references to listening sockets, and selects one to yield as the socket lookup result.</p><p>If we take a look at the corresponding BPF code, the program structure resembles a firewall rule. We have some match statements followed by an action.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2lhm5L9NH0AN8tnMh2cMpl/55d0b7491ccd00249bd1754da42d13c1/bpf_inet_lookup_code_sample-2.png\" alt=\"bpf inet lookup code sample-2\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"929\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>You may notice that we don’t access the BPF map with sockets directly. Instead, we follow an established pattern in BPF called “map based redirection”, where a dedicated BPF helper accesses the map and carries out any steps necessary to redirect the packet.</p><p>We’ve skipped over one thing. Where does the BPF map of sockets come from? We create it ourselves and populate it with sockets. This is most easily done if your service uses systemd <a href=\"http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html\">socket activation</a>. systemd will let you associate more than one service unit with a socket unit, and both of the services will receive a file descriptor for the same socket. From there it’s just a matter of inserting the socket into the BPF map.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2ufZk0QnR4cOf061PvseTW/b8c50ffba83456f9363de3ba43d620d5/bpf_inet_lookup_socket_activation-1.png\" alt=\"bpf inet lookup socket activation-1\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"867\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"demo-time\">Demo time!</h2>\n            <a href=\"#demo-time\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>This is not just a concept.

If two processes are racing to <code>bind</code> and <code>listen</code> on the same TCP port, on an overlapping IP, setting <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> changes which syscall will report an error (<code>EADDRINUSE</code>). Without <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> it will always be the second bind. With <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> set there is a window of opportunity for a second <code>bind</code> to succeed but the subsequent <code>listen</code> to fail.</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/its-crowded-in-here/#quiz-3-question\">Go back</a></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"quiz-4\">Quiz 4</h3>\n            <a href=\"#quiz-4\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Q: Are there really no problems with accepting any connection on any socket?If the connection is destined for an address assigned to our host, i.e. a local address, there are no problems.
