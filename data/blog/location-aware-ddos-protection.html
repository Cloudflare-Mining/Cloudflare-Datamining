	<p>We’re thrilled to introduce Cloudflare’s Location-Aware DDoS Protection.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack">Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks</a> are cyber attacks that aim to make your Internet property unavailable by flooding it with more traffic than it can handle. For this reason, attackers usually aim to generate as much attack traffic as they can — from as many locations as they can. With Location-Aware DDoS Protection, we take this <i>distributed</i> characteristic of the attack, that is thought of being advantageous for the attacker, and turn it on its back — making it into a disadvantage.</p>
	<p>Location-Aware DDoS Protection is now available in beta for Cloudflare Enterprise customers that are subscribed to the Advanced DDoS service.</p>

	<p>Cloudflare’s Location-Aware DDoS Protection takes the attacker’s advantage and uses it against them. By learning where your traffic comes from, the system becomes location-aware and constantly asks “Does it make sense for <i>your</i> website?” when seeing new traffic.</p>
	<p>For example, if you operate an <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce">e-commerce website</a> that mostly serves the German consumer, then most of your traffic would most likely originate from within Germany, some from neighboring European countries, and a decreasing amount as we expand globally to other countries and geographies. If sudden spikes of traffic arrive from unexpected locations outside your main geographies, the system will flag and mitigate the unwanted traffic.</p>
	<p>Location-Aware DDoS Protection also leverages Cloudflare’s <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/#machine-learning">Machine Learning models</a> to identify traffic that is likely automated. This is used as an additional signal to provide more accurate protection.</p>

	<p>Enterprise customers subscribed to the Advanced DDoS service can customize and enable the Location-Aware DDoS Protection system. By default, the system will only show what it thinks is suspicious traffic based on your last 7-day P95 rates, bucketed by client country and region (recalculated every 24 hours).</p>
	<p>Customers can view what the system flagged in the <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=%2F%3Aaccount%2F%3Azone%2Fsecurity"><b>Security Overview</b> dashboard</a>.</p>

	<p>Location-Aware DDoS Protection is exposed to customers as a new HTTP DDoS Managed rule within the existing ruleset. To enable it, change the action to <i>Managed Challenge</i> or <i>Block</i>. Customers can adjust its sensitivity level to define how much tolerance you permit for traffic that deviates from your observed geographies. The lower the sensitivity, the higher the tolerance.</p>
