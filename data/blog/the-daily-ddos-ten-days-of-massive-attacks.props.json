The attack started at 1830 UTC and lasted non-stop for almost exactly 8.5 hours stopping at 0300 UTC. It felt as if an attacker &#39;worked&#39; a day and then went home.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=/content/images/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-11.00.41.png>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3A8FzbN8hX6Qogv7KpVFeT/c63ab79f724e12acc13f67f0feaf6d8b/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-11.00.41.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1380\" height=\"171\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>The very next day the same thing happened again (although the attack started 30 minutes earlier at 1800 UTC).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=/content/images/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-11.03.16.png>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/UN2ck87CU98i7RiTPQemC/6777edecad24dde445b9ae5d1613e43f/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-11.03.16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1380\" height=\"170\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>On the third day the attacker started promptly at 1800 UTC but went home a little early at around 0130 UTC. But they managed to peak the attack over 200Mpps and 480Gbps.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=/content/images/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-11.04.21.png>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/62tWVtXGbAYxfzBhWERpAf/f23a5f447c6e75a5f57a2306c2f1aba9/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-11.04.21.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1372\" height=\"171\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>And the attacker just kept this up day after day. Right through <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-truth-about-black-friday-and-cyber-monday/\">Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday</a> and into this week. Night after night attacks were peaking at 400Gbps and hitting 320Gbps for hours on end.</p><p>This chart shows the packet rate in Mpps.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=/content/images/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-10.53.27-1.png>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/TjvOKcMZd6BGnqjD7yadL/411f519fbbb05708cfe4e90a1258542d/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-10.53.27-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1354\" height=\"191\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>This chart shows the attack bandwidth in <i>gigabytes</i> per second (multiply by 8 to get Gbps).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=/content/images/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-13.51.10-1.png>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2oLL7gsr5eXDP11OqpP6lg/c40e36f2dbbe5b57c222b0b7f9ea01e0/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-13.51.10-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2129\" height=\"380\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>This Tuesday things got interesting. The attacker stopped taking the night off and moved onto working 24 hours a day.</p><p>Another curiosity with these attacks is that they are <i>not</i> coming from the much talked about Mirai botnet. They are using different attack software and are sending very large L3/L4 floods aimed at the TCP protocol. The attacks are also highly concentrated in a small number of locations mostly on the US west coast.</p><p>Throughout we&#39;ve mitigated the attack without impact on customers.</p><p>As we&#39;ve written before, <a href=\"/how-cloudflares-architecture-allows-us-to-scale-to-stop-the-largest-attacks/\">we architected</a> Cloudflare to handle massive attacks automatically. If you are interested in working on systems like this, we&#39;re <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/join-our-team/\">hiring</a>.</p>",
