They do that by encrypting your sensitive messages using public-key cryptography that is cryptographically linked to the certificate itself. But beyond that, TLS certificates are used to make an assertion about identity — verifying that the server is who they claim to be. Server Certificates — used by every website — include the website&#39;s name on the certificate and is issued by a third-party certificate authority (CA) who verifies that the certificate&#39;s information is correct and accurate.</p><p>Browsers only let you visit a website when it&#39;s encrypted using TLS after it has successfully validated the certificate presented by the server — much like how security checks your ID to board a plane.</p><p>We are focusing on securing the Internet now more than ever. We want to make it as easy as possible for any customer to be a security-conscious customer. This is why we’re moving towards a certificate management system, so it’s simple to customize your certificates and TLS settings. We are doing this by giving you the right tools to proactively increase the security of your domain.</p><p>Let’s start by talking about modifying your certificate’s validity period, a small change that can make a big difference.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"decrease-your-certificates-validity-period\">Decrease Your Certificate’s Validity Period</h3>\n      <a href=\"#decrease-your-certificates-validity-period\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://cabforum.org/\">Certification Authority Browser Forum</a> — a voluntary group that sets the industry guidelines for certificates — has been shortening the maximum validity period for publicly trusted certificates over the past several years. You used to be able to get a three-year cert, but now you can only get a one-year cert. Why did they do this?</p><p>Rotating a certificate more frequently should — but does not necessarily — mean you&#39;re rotating your private key more frequently. Changing secrets more frequently means that if a secret (in this case a private key) is ever compromised, the compromise has a smaller maximum lifespan. This is widely regarded as a better security posture and helps to minimize the risk associated with key compromise.</p><p>It also has the added bonus of <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html\">encouraging automation</a> — the more frequently you have to do a task, the more likely you&#39;ll want to automate it. Automation means you&#39;re less likely to let a cert expire in production or give a person access to key material.</p><p>With Advanced Certificate Manager, you can set your certificate validity period to be as short as 14 days. By shortening the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/certificate-lifecycle-management/\">lifecycle of your certificate</a>, you are proactively improving your security posture. As you keep rotating your certificate and private keys upon renewals, you reduce the risk of exposure.</p><p>For some, setting a short validity period can increase the risk of downtime. This is because short validity periods require frequent certificate issuance and can overload servers.</p><p>At Cloudflare, it’s not a problem. Shorter validity periods encouraged us to keep improving our certificate issuance and renewal pipeline. With ~4.5 million certificates issued a day, we can confidently say that every customer can set a 14-day validity period, and we’ll take care of it.</p><p>Overall, the <a href=\"https://www.websecurity.digicert.com/blog/cabforum-votes-shorten-certificate-lifetime-validity-periods-impacts#:~:text=This%20topic%20led%20to%20a,also%20had%20an%20unintended%20consequence.&text=However%2C%20effective%20April%2022%2C%202017,unless%20a%20corrective%20ballot%20passes.\">industry is moving towards shortening</a> certificate cycles, so we are very excited to make this an easy option for our customers.</p><p>Some customers want to go a step further and control the cipher suites used for TLS. Now, with ACM, you can do just that!</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"setting-cipher-suites\">Setting Cipher Suites</h3>\n      <a href=\"#setting-cipher-suites\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>A cipher suite is a set of algorithms that help secure a network connection that uses TLS. The set of algorithms that cipher suites contain are :</p><ul><li><p>Key Exchange Algorithm</p></li><li><p>Authentication Algorithm</p></li><li><p>Bulk encryption Algorithm</p></li><li><p>Message Authentication Code (MAC) Algorithm</p></li></ul>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3gqYUWUnmEsDfvxp1kmeZF/e8e32afa1b0028e66bec624fd06ce3d0/image2-46.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1220\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When two servers want to communicate with one another securely over TLS, they start off by initiating a TLS handshake. During the TLS handshake, the client and the server establish which encryption algorithms they will be using. The client initiates this handshake with the Client Hello message that indicates the cipher suites — or encryption algorithms — it supports. The server then responds with the Server Hello message which contains its choice of cipher based on the list of supported ciphers that the client sent.</p><p>When a user connects to a website on Cloudflare’s network, Cloudflare is responsible for choosing a cipher. In the past, we’ve <a href=\"/staying-on-top-of-tls-attacks/\">talked about</a> how Cloudflare’s servers prefer certain ciphers. For example, we prioritize ciphers that use ECDHE over those that start with RSA. As discussed in our previous blog post, RSA is more susceptible to security vulnerabilities, especially if an SSL server’s private key were to leak.</p><p>While prioritizing certain ciphers over others offers a higher level of security, we are going a step further and giving our customers the ability to choose which cipher suites from Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/203041594-Cloudflare-SSL-cipher-browser-and-protocol-support\">list of approved ciphers</a> they want their website to support. For those that want to remove weak ciphers and only allow the strongest ciphers available, they can now do so through one API call. To do this, they would use the <a href=\"https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-settings-change-ciphers-setting\">Cipher Suite Settings endpoint</a> and indicate their allowlist of ciphers for TLS termination.</p><p>Customers like <a href=\"https://onetrust.com/\">OneTrust</a> and <a href=\"https://report-uri.com/\">Report URI</a> use this functionality to improve their security posture:</p><blockquote><p>Advanced Certificate Manager has simplified the way we manage certificates across our many domains, while still allowing us to meet our strict security requirements.

Cloudflare takes key management seriously, with both highly secure key management software and <a href=\"/introducing-cloudflare-geo-key-manager/\">hardware controls</a>.
