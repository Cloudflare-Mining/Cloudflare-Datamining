At the same time, we want to make sure that the positive changes that we are making are also something that our local Cloudflare team members can touch and feel, and know that in each of our actions we are having a positive impact on the environment around us. This is why we make sustainability one of the underlying goals of the design, construction, and operations of our global office spaces.</p><p>To make this type of pervasive change we have focused our efforts in three main areas: working with sustainable construction materials, efficient operations, and renewable energy purchasing (using clean sources like sunlight and wind). We believe that sustainable design goes far beyond just purchasing recycled and regenerative products. If you don’t operate your space with efficiency and renewables in mind, we haven’t fully accounted for all of our environmental impact.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"sustainability-in-office-design-construction\">Sustainability in office design &amp; construction</h3>\n      <a href=\"#sustainability-in-office-design-construction\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/27YE8GuVLmIpWtGPIOoeoJ/2a288803b0220aa10fbc50ef66e659c2/image1.jpg\" alt=\"“The Retreat” in the San Francisco Cloudflare office, featuring preserved moss and live plants\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1878\" height=\"1012\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>__“The Retreat” in the San Francisco Cloudflare office, featuring preserved moss and live plants__‌‌</p><p>Since 2020, we have been redefining how our teams work together, and how work takes place in physical spaces.

Sustainable and healthy spaces are a major element to this concept.</p><p>We are excited to highlight a few of the different products and concepts that are currently being used in the development of our workplaces - both new locations and in the reimagination of our existing spaces. While experimenting with the way that our teams work together in person, we also consider our new and updated spaces a sort of sustainability learning lab.

Their materials, construction, and transportation should have either a minimal, or regenerative, impact on the environment or the waste stream while also meeting high performance standards. A great example of this is the acoustic sound baffling used in our recent San Francisco and London redesign and currently being installed at our newest office, which is under construction.</p><p>If you’ve ever worked in an open office, you know that effective sound management is critical, regardless of if the space is for collaborative or focus work. In order to help with this challenge, we use a substantial number of acoustic baffles to help significantly reduce sound transfer. Traditionally, baffles are made out of tightly woven synthetic fibers. Unfortunately, a majority of baffles on the market today generate new plastic in the waste stream.</p><p>We chose to move away from traditional baffles by installing FilaSorb acoustic baffles by AcouFelt. The fibers in FilaSorb are made from post-consumer plastic beverage bottles diverted from landfills. <a href=\"https://wp.acoufelt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Acoufelt-Sustainability-Brochure-Oct2022.pdf\">Every square foot of our FilaSorb felt contains the regenerated fibers made from over 10, 20oz recycled bottles.</a> Each panel has a useful life of over twenty years, and at the end of its life the panel can be <a href=\"https://wp.acoufelt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Acoufelt_Material-Safety-Data-Sheet_US_Oct2022.pdf\">recycled again</a>.</p><p>The International Institute of Living Futures has certified that this product is acceptable for the Living Building Challenge, which is the most rigorous regenerative building standard in the world.</p><p>Similarly to FilaSorb, we also installed <a href=\"https://www.baux.com/acoustic-products/wood-wool/panels/\">BAUX Acoustic Wood Wool</a> paneling to provide additional sound dampening and a vibrant acoustic wall treatment. Designed using a process that focuses on recarbonation, <a href=\"https://www.baux.com/sustainability/materials/\">BAUX Wood Wool panels absorb over 6.9 kg per meter squared of carbon dioxide.</a> That’s a little over 70% of the total measured CO2 released during the entire manufacturing life cycle of the panel. Beyond their acoustic benefits, Wood Wool panels resist heat and are ideal insulators. This enables us to use less energy in heating and cooling to maintain a stable temperature in fluctuating weather.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/NjGUIXdjFwfIcsiTZrZ7r/76e32bbebe3b1f4191134dea3e4a599e/image4-14.png\" alt=\"Interface’s Net Effect Carpet Collection uses discarded fishing nets in their construction\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1145\" height=\"574\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Interface’s Net Effect Carpet Collection uses discarded fishing nets in their construction</i></p><p>Flooring is also a significant focus of our design team.

Net-Works provides a source of income for small fishing villages in the Philippines while cleaning up their beaches and waters. The collected nets are sold to Aquafil, who, in turn, converts them into yarn for Interface carpet tile.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"furniture-in-landfills-oh-my\">Furniture in landfills?

To do our part to keep furniture out of landfills, we are ensuring that we are reusing (and in some cases completely repurposing) our existing furniture portfolio as much as possible in every one of our projects.</p><p>We have taken it a step further to include our employees working from home.

We understand the importance of natural light and plants within our spaces to help encourage the health and wellbeing of our teammates, thus we have a vast amount of plants in our San Francisco office. While we chose our plants for their low water consumption, they still require water. Our rain water capture system provides the water for all of our plants.</p><p>Additionally, we are focused on cultural changes amongst our staff to reduce our waste streams (which was no small feat amongst our die-hard LaCroix fans!). We have adopted <a href=\"https://www.bevi.co/water-dispensers/countertop-water-dispensers/\">Bevi</a> sparkling and flavored water dispensing machines alongside traditional soda fountains to fully remove bottled water from our facilities.
