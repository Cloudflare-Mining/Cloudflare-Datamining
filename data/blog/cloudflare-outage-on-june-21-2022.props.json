A change to the network configuration in those locations caused an outage which started at 06:27 UTC. At 06:58 UTC the first data center was brought back online and by 07:42 UTC all data centers were online and working correctly.</p><p>Depending on your location in the world you may have been unable to access websites and services that rely on Cloudflare. In other locations, Cloudflare continued to operate normally.</p><p>We are very sorry for this outage.

Specifically, we were adding informational communities to our site-local prefixes.</p><p>These prefixes allow our metals to communicate with each other, as well as connect to customer origins. As part of the change procedure at Cloudflare, a Change Request ticket was created, which includes a dry-run of the change, as well as a stepped rollout procedure. Before it was allowed to go out, it was also peer reviewed by multiple engineers. Unfortunately, in this case, the steps weren’t small enough to catch the error before it hit all of our spines.</p><p>The change looked like this on one of the routers:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">[edit policy-options policy-statement 4-COGENT-TRANSIT-OUT term ADV-SITELOCAL then]\n+      community add STATIC-ROUTE;\n+      community add SITE-LOCAL-ROUTE;\n+      community add TLL01;\n+      community add EUROPE;\n[edit policy-options policy-statement 4-PUBLIC-PEER-ANYCAST-OUT term ADV-SITELOCAL then]\n+      community add STATIC-ROUTE;\n+      community add SITE-LOCAL-ROUTE;\n+      community add TLL01;\n+      community add EUROPE;\n[edit policy-options policy-statement 6-COGENT-TRANSIT-OUT term ADV-SITELOCAL then]\n+      community add STATIC-ROUTE;\n+      community add SITE-LOCAL-ROUTE;\n+      community add TLL01;\n+      community add EUROPE;\n[edit policy-options policy-statement 6-PUBLIC-PEER-ANYCAST-OUT term ADV-SITELOCAL then]\n+      community add STATIC-ROUTE;\n+      community add SITE-LOCAL-ROUTE;\n+      community add TLL01;\n+      community add EUROPE;</pre></code>\n            <p>This was harmless, and just added some additional information to these prefix advertisements. The change on the spines was the following:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">[edit policy-options policy-statement AGGREGATES-OUT]\nterm 6-DISABLED_PREFIXES { ... }\n!    term 6-ADV-TRAFFIC-PREDICTOR { ... }\n!    term 4-ADV-TRAFFIC-PREDICTOR { ... }\n!    term ADV-FREE { ... }\n!    term ADV-PRO { ... }\n!    term ADV-BIZ { ... }\n!    term ADV-ENT { ... }\n!    term ADV-DNS { ... }\n!    term REJECT-THE-REST { ... }\n!    term 4-ADV-SITE-LOCALS { ... }\n!    term 6-ADV-SITE-LOCALS { ... }\n[edit policy-options policy-statement AGGREGATES-OUT term 4-ADV-SITE-LOCALS then]\ncommunity delete NO-EXPORT { ... }\n+      community add STATIC-ROUTE;\n+      community add SITE-LOCAL-ROUTE;\n+      community add AMS07;\n+      community add EUROPE;\n[edit policy-options policy-statement AGGREGATES-OUT term 6-ADV-SITE-LOCALS then]\ncommunity delete NO-EXPORT { ... }\n+      community add STATIC-ROUTE;\n+      community add SITE-LOCAL-ROUTE;\n+      community add AMS07;\n+      community add EUROPE;</pre></code>\n            <p>An initial glance at this diff might give the impression that this change is identical, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. If we focus on one part of the diff, it might become clear why:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">!    term REJECT-THE-REST { ... }\n!    term 4-ADV-SITE-LOCALS { ... }\n!    term 6-ADV-SITE-LOCALS { ... }</pre></code>\n            <p>In this diff format, the exclamation marks in front of the terms indicate a re-ordering of the terms. In this case, multiple terms moved up, and two terms were added to the bottom. Specifically, the 4-ADV-SITE-LOCALS and 6-ADV-SITE-LOCALS terms moved from the top to the bottom. These terms were now behind the REJECT-THE-REST term, and as might be clear from the name, this term is an explicit reject:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">term REJECT-THE-REST {\n    then reject;\n} </pre></code>\n            <p>As this term is now before the site-local terms, we immediately stopped advertising our site-local prefixes, removing our direct access to all the impacted locations, as well as removing the ability of our servers to reach origin servers.</p><p>On top of the inability to contact origins, the removal of these site-local prefixes also caused our internal load balancing system Multimog (a variation of our <a href=\"/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/\">Unimog load-balancer</a>) to stop working, as it could no longer forward requests between the servers in our MCPs. This meant that our smaller compute clusters in an MCP received the same amount of traffic as our largest clusters, causing the smaller ones to overload.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/jBcPxvumdeOx5Ffojnwuw/d34adc458e95b357c521733a933d73bf/image4-15.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1180\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"remediation-and-follow-up-steps\">Remediation and follow-up steps</h3>\n      <a href=\"#remediation-and-follow-up-steps\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>This incident had widespread impact, and we take availability very seriously. We have identified several areas of improvement and will continue to work on uncovering any other gaps that could cause a recurrence.</p><p>Here is what we are working on immediately:</p><p><b>Process</b>: While the MCP program was designed to improve availability, a procedural gap in how we updated these data centers ultimately caused a broader impact in MCP locations specifically. While we did use a stagger procedure for this change, the stagger policy did not include an MCP data center until the final step. Change procedures and automation need to include MCP-specific test and deploy procedures to ensure there are no unintended consequences.</p><p><b>Architecture</b>: The incorrect router configuration prevented the proper routes from being announced, preventing traffic from flowing properly to our infrastructure. Ultimately the policy statement that caused the incorrect routing advertisement will be redesigned to prevent an unintentional incorrect ordering.</p><p><b>Automation</b>: There are several opportunities in our automation suite that would mitigate some or all of the impact seen from this event. Primarily, we will be concentrating on automation improvements that enforce an improved stagger policy for rollouts of network configuration and provide an automated “commit-confirm” rollback. The former enhancement would have significantly lessened the overall impact, and the latter would have greatly reduced the Time-to-Resolve during the incident.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n      <a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Although Cloudflare has invested significantly in our MCP design to improve service availability, we clearly fell short of our customer expectations with this very painful incident.
