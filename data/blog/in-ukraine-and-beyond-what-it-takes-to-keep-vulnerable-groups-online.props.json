To help understand threats against these groups, we broke down the types of attacks we saw that were <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/how-to-prevent-sql-injection/\">mitigated</a> by the web application firewall. A majority of the mitigated traffic is from HTTP anomalies and SQLi (SQL injection).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/sql-injection/\">SQLi</a> is an attack technique designed to modify or retrieve data from SQL databases. By inserting specialized SQL statements into a form field, attackers attempt to execute commands that allow for the retrieval of data from the database, modification of data within the database, the destruction of sensitive data, or other manipulative behaviors.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/8IVDuDgZp4BUUyOFYxBlt/ef630c4b46b30975716a2c373edab554/image6-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Learn more on the 8th Anniversary Radar DashboardSee the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/notebooks/project-galileo-8th-anniv\">full report</a> on attack trends we observed against a wide range of organizations protected under Project Galileo.</p>",
