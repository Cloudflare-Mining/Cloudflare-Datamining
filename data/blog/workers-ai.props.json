Whether you&#39;re using <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/\">AI</a> in your workflow to improve productivity, or you’re shipping AI based features to your users, it’s everywhere. The focus on AI improvements are extraordinary, and we’re super excited about the opportunities that lay ahead, but it&#39;s not enough.</p><p>Not too long ago, if you wanted to leverage the power of AI, you needed to know the ins and outs of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-machine-learning/\">machine learning</a>, and be able to manage the infrastructure to power it.</p><p>As a developer platform with over one million active developers, we believe there is so much potential yet to be unlocked, so we’re changing the way AI is delivered to developers. Many of the current solutions, while powerful, are based on closed, proprietary models and don&#39;t address privacy needs that developers and users demand. Alternatively, the open source scene is exploding with powerful models, but they’re simply not accessible enough to every developer. Imagine being able to run a model, from your code, wherever it’s hosted, and never needing to find GPUs or deal with setting up the infrastructure to support it.</p><p>That&#39;s why we are excited to launch Workers AI - an AI inference as a service platform, empowering developers to run AI models with just a few lines of code, all powered by our global network of GPUs. It&#39;s open and accessible, serverless, privacy-focused, runs near your users, pay-as-you-go, and it&#39;s built from the ground up for a best in class developer experience.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"workers-ai-making-inference-just-work\">Workers AI - making inference <b>just work</b></h2>\n            <a href=\"#workers-ai-making-inference-just-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>We’re launching Workers AI to put AI inference in the hands of every developer, and to actually deliver on that goal, it should <b>just work</b> out of the box.

Over time, we’ve realized that a better Internet is also a more private Internet, and we want to play a role in building it.</p><p>That’s why Workers AI is private by default - we don’t train our models, LLM or otherwise, on your data or conversations, and our models don’t learn from your usage. You can feel confident using Workers AI in both personal and business settings, without having to worry about leaking your data. Other providers only offer this fundamental feature with their enterprise version. With us, it’s built in for everyone.</p><p>We’re also excited to support data localization in the future. To make this happen, we have an ambitious GPU rollout plan - we’re launching with seven sites today, roughly 100 by the end of 2023, and nearly everywhere by the end of 2024. Ultimately, this will empower developers to keep delivering killer AI features to their users, while staying compliant with their end users’ data localization requirements.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"the-power-of-the-platform\">The power of the platform</h2>\n            <a href=\"#the-power-of-the-platform\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <h4>Vector database - Vectorize</h4><p>Workers AI is all about running Inference, and making it really easy to do so, but sometimes inference is only part of the equation. Large language models are trained on a fixed set of data, based on a snapshot at a specific point in the past, and have no context on your business or use case. When you submit a prompt, information specific to you can increase the quality of results, making it more useful and relevant. That’s why we’re also launching Vectorize, our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-vector-database/\">vector database</a> that’s designed to work seamlessly with Workers AI. Here’s a quick overview of how you might use Workers AI + Vectorize together.</p><p>Example: Use your data (knowledge base) to provide additional context to an LLM when a user is chatting with it.</p><ol><li><p><b>Generate initial embeddings:</b> run your data through Workers AI using an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-are-embeddings/\">embedding model</a>. The output will be embeddings, which are numerical representations of those words.</p></li><li><p><b>Insert those embeddings into Vectorize:</b> this essentially seeds the vector database with your data, so we can later use it to retrieve embeddings that are similar to your users’ query</p></li><li><p><b>Generate embedding from user question:</b> when a user submits a question to your AI app, first, take that question, and run it through Workers AI using an embedding model.</p></li><li><p><b>Get context from Vectorize:</b> use that embedding to query Vectorize. This should output embeddings that are similar to your user’s question.</p></li><li><p><b>Create context aware prompt:</b> Now take the original text associated with those embeddings, and create a new prompt combining the text from the vector search, along with the original question</p></li><li><p><b>Run prompt:</b> run this prompt through Workers AI using an LLM model to get your final result</p></li></ol><h4>AI Gateway</h4><p>That covers a more advanced use case. On the flip side, if you are running models elsewhere, but want to get more out of the experience, you can run those APIs through our AI gateway to get features like caching, rate-limiting, analytics and logging. These features can be used to protect your end point, monitor and optimize costs, and also help with data loss prevention.

If there’s a particular model you&#39;d love to see on Workers AI, pop into our <a href=\"https://discord.cloudflare.com/\">Discord</a> and let us know!</p><p>In addition to that, we&#39;re also announcing a <a href=\"/best-place-region-earth-inference\">partnership with Hugging Face</a>, and soon you&#39;ll be able to access and run a subset of the Hugging Face catalog directly from Workers AI.</p><h4>Analytics + observability</h4><p>Up to this point, we’ve been hyper focussed on one thing - making it really easy for any developer to run powerful AI models in just a few lines of code. But that’s only one part of the story. Up next, we’ll be working on some analytics and observability capabilities to give you insights into your usage + performance + spend on a per-model basis, plus the ability to fig into your logs if you want to do some exploring.</p><h4>A road to global GPU coverage</h4><p>Our goal is to be the best place to run inference on Region: Earth, so we&#39;re adding GPUs to our data centers as fast as we can.</p><p><b>We plan to be in 100 data centers by the end of this year</b></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5A8SGUOEAcs3sjNjv48yIh/bafbc77b256fef490d4357613b036603/image3-28.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1801\" height=\"1013\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>And nearly everywhere by the end of 2024</b></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2rrL2H0dHYZ4hxOBq0X1pw/f38d122af92f789dc2b31d3bdea1ab06/unnamed-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>We’re really excited to see you build</b> - head over to <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/\">our docs</a> to get started.</p><p>If you need inspiration, want to share something you’re building, or have a question - pop into our <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev\">Developer Discord</a>.</p>",
