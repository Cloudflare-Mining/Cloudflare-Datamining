One of the biggest challenges with logs is the cost of managing them, so earlier this year, we launched the ability to <a href=\"/store-and-retrieve-logs-on-r2/\">store and retrieve</a> Cloudflare logs using R2.</p><p>In this post, I’ll explain how we built the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/r2-log-retrieval/\">R2 Log Retrieval API</a> using Cloudflare Workers with a focus on Durable Objects and the Streams API. Using these, allows a customer to index and query millions of their Cloudflare logs stored in batches on R2.</p><p>Before we dive into the internals you might be wondering why one doesn&#39;t just use a traditional database to index these logs? After all, databases are a well proven technology. Well, the reason is that individual developers or companies, both large and small, often don&#39;t have the resources necessary to maintain such a database and the surrounding infrastructure to create this kind of setup.</p><p>Our approach instead relies on Durable Objects to maintain indexes of the data stored in R2, removing the complexity of managing and maintaining your own database. It was also super easy to add Durable Objects to our existing Workers code with just a few lines of config and some code. And R2 is very economical.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"indexing\">Indexing</h2>\n            <a href=\"#indexing\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Indexing data is often used to reduce the lookup time for a query by first pre-processing the data and computing an index – usually a file (or set of files) that have a known structure which can be used to perform lookups on the underlying data. This approach makes lookups quick as indexes typically contain the answer for a given query, or at the very least, tells you how to find it. For this project we are going to index records by the unique identifier called a <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/reference/cloudflare-ray-id/\">RayID</a> which our customers use to identify an HTTP request in their logs, but this solution can be modified to index many other types of data.</p><p>When indexing RayIDs for logs stored in R2, we choose an index structure that is fairly straightforward and is commonly known as a forward-index. This type of index consists of a key-value mapping between a document&#39;s name and a list of words contained in that document. The terms &quot;document&quot; and &quot;words&quot; are meant to be generic, and you get to define what a document and a word is.</p><p>In our case, a document is a batch of logs stored in R2 and the words are RayIDs contained within that document. For example, our index currently looks like this:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/GSL12fcNI0rI91FttQe9Y/317612cd90d9dfb4ed4ea5cb8c4d1f8b/image1-33.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"535\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"building-an-index-using-durable-objects-and-the-streams-api\">Building an index using Durable Objects and the Streams API</h3>\n            <a href=\"#building-an-index-using-durable-objects-and-the-streams-api\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In order to maintain the state of our index, we chose to use Durable Objects. Each Durable Object has its own transactional key-value storage. Therefore, to store our index, we assign each key to be the document (batch) name and the value being a JSON-array of RayIDs within that document. When extracting the RayIDs for a given batch, updating the index becomes as simple as <code>storage.put(batchName, rayIds)</code>. Likewise, getting all the RayIDs for a document is just a call to <code>storage.get(batchName)</code>.</p><p>When performing indexing, since the batches are stored using compression and often with a 30-100x compression ratio, reading an entire batch into memory can lead to out-of-memory (OOM) errors in our Worker. To get around this, we use the Streams API to avoid the OOM errors by processing the data in smaller chunks. There are two types of streams available: byte-oriented and value-oriented. Byte-oriented streams operate at the byte-level for things such as compressing and decompressing data, while the value-orientated streams work on first class values in JavaScript. Numbers, strings, <code>undefined</code>, <code>null</code>, objects, you name it. If it&#39;s a valid JavaScript value, you can process it using a value-oriented stream. The Streams API also allows us to define our own JavaScript transformations for both byte- and value-oriented streams.</p><p>So, when our API receives a request to index a batch, our Worker streams the contents from R2 into a pipeline of <code>TransformationStream</code>s to decompress the data, decode the bytes into strings, split the data into records based on the newlines, and finally collect all the RayIDs. Once we&#39;ve collected all the RayIDs, the data is then persisted in the index by making calls to the Durable Object, which in turn calls the aforementioned <code>storage.put</code> method to persist the data to the index. To illustrate what I mean, I include some code detailing the steps described above.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\">async function index(r2, bucket, key, storage) {\n  const obj = await getObject(r2, bucket, key);\n\n  const rawStream = obj.Body as ReadableStream;\n  const index: Record&lt;string, string[]&gt; = {};\n\n  const rayIdIndexingStream = new TransformStream({\n    transform(chunk: string) {\n      for (const match of chunk.matchAll(RAYID_FIELD_REGEX)) {\n        const { rayid } = match.groups!;\n        if (key in index) {\n          index[key].push(rayid);\n        } else {\n          index[key] = [rayid];\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  await collectStream(rawStream.pipeThrough(new DecompressionStream(&#039;gzip&#039;)).pipeThrough(textDecoderStream()).pipeThrough(readlineStream()).pipeThrough(rayIdIndexingStream));\n  storage.put(index);\n}</pre></code>\n            \n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"searching-for-a-rayid\">Searching for a RayID</h3>\n            <a href=\"#searching-for-a-rayid\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Once a batch has been indexed, and the index is persisted to our Durable Object, we can then query it using a combination of the RayID and a batch name to check the presence of a RayID in that given batch. Assuming that a zone is producing a batch of logs at the rate of one batch per second this means that over 86,400 batches would be produced in a day! Over the course of a week, there would be far too many keys in our index for us to be able to iterate through them all in a timely manner. This is where the encoding of a RayID and the naming of each batch comes into play.</p><p>A RayID is currently, and I emphasize currently because this can change and has over time, a 16-byte hex encoded value where the first 36-bits encode a timestamp, and it looks something like: <code>764660d8ec5c2ab1</code>. Note that the format of the RayID is likely to evolve in the near future, but for now we can use it to optimize retrieval.</p><p>Each batch produced by Logpush also happens to encode the time the batch was started and completed. Last but not least, upon analysis of our logging pipeline we found that 95% of RayIDs can be found in a batch produced within five minutes of the request completing. (Note that the encoded time sets a <i>lower bound</i> of the batch time we need to search).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/CQQIphdmvG7aDifAvU3YT/8a4461caaaec9ad2bbea1bfea5cfd4d2/image5-8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1608\" height=\"325\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Encoding of a RayID</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3kqEm2Y08awXjSUjx1oGg4/12c4768e6779434f31ce51b55dc99dec/image2-26.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"108\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Encoding of a batch name</p><p>For example: say we have a request that was made on November 3 at 16:00:00 UTC.
