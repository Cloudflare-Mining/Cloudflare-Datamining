This effect becomes even more clear if I only show tests ran in Australia. Sydney is 9,735 miles (53 light-ms) from our instance in us-east-1.

I have some guesses. Workers is built on V8 isolates, which are significantly faster to spin up (under 5ms) than a full NodeJS process and have a tenth the memory overhead. The effect of having to wait for new processes start is very obvious when you look at the difference in speed for the first request which hits a new Lambda@Edge function:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6mr8YDry1DhlTzRT1fAUvd/8ac00c07272271b2b3ee7df11cabe2d5/Screen-Shot-2018-06-27-at-4.59.01-PM-1.png\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2018-06-27-at-4.59.01-PM-1\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2258\" height=\"986\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Workers has also been carefully architected to avoid moving memory and blocking when it could be avoided, complete with our own optimized implementations of the Javascript APIs. Finally, Workers runs on the same thousands of machines which serve Cloudflare traffic around the world, benefiting from over half a decade of experience pushing the limits of our hardware.</p><p>This post has been somewhat self-congratulatory, and I apologize for that. We certainly still have a lot to build and a lot we can still do to improve our performance. It was originally going to be about the power of running your functions distributed all around the world, instead of at a single region. What I&#39;m left with though is the belief that Workers is faster, period.</p><p>Here is a <a href=\"https://p.catchpoint.com/ui/Entry/PC/V/ARA-C-D-K3hlIjV3IoXdgAA\">full chart</a> for the last hour.
