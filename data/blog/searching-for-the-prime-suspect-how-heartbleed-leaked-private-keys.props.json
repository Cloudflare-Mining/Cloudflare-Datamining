When the challenge was defeated in a matter of hours it became obvious that it was fairly easy to find the prime numbers that are at the heart of an RSA private key.</p><p>Most of the people who obtained the private SSL key of the challenge server did so by searching the results returned in Heartbleed messages for prime numbers. Testing for prime numbers itself is pretty simple (although slow): find a number and see if it has any divisors. Since the length of the prime numbers (in bits) was known it was just a matter of finding all blocks of 1,024 bits and seeing if they were actually a prime.</p><p>Finding one prime is enough to break the private SSL key.</p><p>The question we wanted to answer was: &quot;Why was it apparently so easy to find prime numbers in Heartbleed results?&quot; To get to the answer I instrumented a vulnerable version of OpenSSL (1.0.1f) and began the search for the primes and where they end up in memory. Strangely, it seemed that OpenSSL was set up to cleanse memory of primes (and other sensitive values) when they were no longer being used. So, what was going on?</p><p>But first a detour into the RSA algorithm and how it is implemented efficiently.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"rsa-and-the-montgomery-reduction\">RSA and the Montgomery Reduction</h3>\n            <a href=\"#rsa-and-the-montgomery-reduction\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The full details of the RSA cryptographic scheme can be read <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)\">here</a>, but, the short version is that two large prime numbers (almost always called p and q) are chosen and kept secret. The product of those two numbers is referred to as the modulus, typically called N (N = p x q).</p><p>It&#39;s safe to make N public (it is part of what&#39;s called the public key) because it is believed (by mathematicians and computer scientists) that working out p and q from N is difficult (i.e. it is believed that factoring N is hard as long as p and q are very large).</p><p>So, when a brower connects to a site that&#39;s using SSL it obtains the public key from the site and the site keeps p and q secret. But the site needs p and q to encrypt data and so they are typically (but not always) held in memory of the server handling the web site.</p><p>In the Heartbleed attack is was possible to find one of p or q in the Heartbleed packets that were returned containing blocks of memory from the vulnerable server. Since N is public, once you have either of p or q the other can easily be worked out by dividing N by the prime you&#39;ve found.</p><p>Note, that in one Heartbleed attack a researcher used <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith's_Attack\">Coppersmith&#39;s Attack</a>. That attack is a complex mathematical attack which means that it&#39;s possible to split N into p and q if you find just part of a prime number. Read the details of that <a href=\"http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2014/04/25/heartbleed-and-rsa-private-keys/\">here</a>.</p><p>In practice, the mathematics used in RSA is rather slow and various schemes have been invented to speed it up. One, which is used by OpenSSL, is known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_reduction\">Montgomery Reduction</a>.</p><p>Deep inside RSA the fundamental operation that has to be performed is a multiplication modulo N. If you are not familiar with the term &quot;modulo N&quot;, it simply means &quot;divide by N and take the remainder&quot;. For example, here&#39;s 13 x 29 modulo 11 (which will be 13 x 29 divided by 11 and take the remainder):</p><p>13 x 29 modulo 11\n= 377 modulo 11\n= 3 (377/11 = 34 remainder 3)</p><p>This is a very expensive operation for a computer to perform (and in RSA it is performed repeatedly) because it involves multiplication and division (if you remember long division from school you&#39;ll remember how laborious it is: computers find it similarly difficult when compared to addition or subtraction).</p><p>In 1985, mathematician Peter Montgomery showed that it was possible to perform &#39;multiplication modulo N&#39; <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1090/S0025-5718-1985-0777282-X\">very quickly</a> as follows. At each step the following is performed:</p><ol><li><p>A digit from the left number is multiplied by the right number and added to a temporary variable (usually called an accumulator);</p></li><li><p>The accumulator is divided by 10 and the decimals are discarded;</p></li><li><p>If there are digits remaining in the left number then add to the accumulator the number r where r x 11 plus whatever is currently in the accumulator would be divisible by 10.</p></li><li><p>Move on to the next digit if there is one</p></li></ol><p>For example, 13 x 29 mod 11 can be calculated like this:</p><p>Accumulator</p><p>0\n87           Added 3 x 29\n8            Divided by 10\n10           Added 2 because 2 x 11 + 8 = 30 (divisible by 10)\n39           Added 1 x 29\n3            Divided by 10</p><p>The answer, 3, is in the accumulator. What&#39;s important here is that only &#39;easy&#39; calculations were performed: small multiplications by a single digit and division by 10. In the computer implementation all of this is done in binary with division by 2 instead of 10. Division by 2 is very, very easy to implement on a computer.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"under-the-hood-of-openssl\">Under the hood of OpenSSL</h3>\n            <a href=\"#under-the-hood-of-openssl\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>To understand how primes are used inside OpenSSL I instrumented the code to output information about all the memory allocated by OpenSSL and to highlight blocks of memory used for prime numbers.

To protect against that it would be necessary to change the way OpenSSL memory is allocated so that memory allocated for sensitive data (like private keys) is kept far away from the memory buffers used for messages. A <a href=\"http://marc.info/?l=openssl-dev&m=139800505608917&w=2\">patch for this</a> has been submitted to OpenSSL.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n            <a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>A more radical solution is to not store the private keys inside OpenSSL at all. If the private key is not stored in the same process as OpenSSL it will not be accessible via a fault like Heartbleed.</p><p>CloudFlare is already testing that configuration. More on that in another blog post.</p><p>PS I am very grateful for <a href=\"http://matthewarcus.wordpress.com/about/\">Matthew Arcus</a> for corresponding with me about this and checking some of my assertions. It was Matthew who first pointed out that the Montgomery Reduction was another source of leaked primes.</p>",
