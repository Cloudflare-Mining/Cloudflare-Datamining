	<p>We're happy to release today a couple APIs that allow web developers to
		integrate CloudFlare directly into their web applications.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html" target="_blank">CloudFlare DNS / Threat Control
			API</a>
		<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html" target="_blank">CloudFlare Settings
			API</a>
	</p>
	<p>If you're a web developer, what could you do with these APIs? Well, you
		could....</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Add a button to Joomla's control panel to automatically clear your
			CloudFlare cache</li>
		<li>Create a WordPress plugin that allows you to change your security
			level right from the control panel</li>
		<li>Automatically add the IPs of visitors you report as spam in Drupal
			to your CloudFlare Threat Control block list</li>
		<li>Update your DNS records hosted in CloudFlare from your custom cPanel
			module</li>
		<li>Report your unique visitor stats from within your vBulletin board</li>
		<li>And much more!</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These APIs join the existing CloudFlare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/host-api.html" target="_blank">Hosting Provider
			API</a>, which allows hosting
		providers to offer CloudFlare to their users without giving up control
		of DNS. While the Hosting Provider API is limited to approved hosts, the
		new APIs are open to anyone with a CloudFlare account.</p>
	<p>We're excited to see how web developers will integrate with the news
		APIs, and we're committed to exposing more functionality over time so
		<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/contact.html" target="_blank">let us know</a> what you'd like
		to see. Finally don't forget to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/contact.html" target="_blank">tell
			us</a> if you build a plugin or
		other functionality with the CloudFlare API so we can promote your work
		to the whole CloudFlare community!
