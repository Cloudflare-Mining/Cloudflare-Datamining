Amini was a 22-year-old woman from the Kurdistan Province of Iran, and was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/middleeast/iranian-woman-dies-police-intl/index.html\">arrested on September 13, 2022, in Tehran by Iran’s “morality police”</a>, a unit that enforces strict dress codes for women. She died on <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/16/iranian-woman-dies-after-moral-polices-detention-reports\">September 16</a> while in police custody.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/four-iranian-police-officers-injured-one-assistant-killed-after-protests-irna-2022-09-21/\">Published reports</a> indicate that the growing protests have resulted in at least eight deaths. Iran has a history of restricting Internet connectivity in response to protests, taking such steps in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1523051860265148418\">May 2022</a>, <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/iran-blackout-2021-internet-shutdowns-sistan-baluchistan/\">February 2021</a>, and <a href=\"https://iran-shutdown.amnesty.org/\">November 2019</a>. They have taken a similar approach to the current protests, including disrupting Internet connectivity, blocking social media platforms, and blocking DNS. The impact of these actions, as seen through Cloudflare’s data, are reviewed below.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"impact-to-internet-traffic\">Impact to Internet traffic</h3>\n      <a href=\"#impact-to-internet-traffic\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In the city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanandaj\">Sanandij</a> in the Kurdistan Province, <a href=\"https://www.ncr-iran.org/en/ncri-statements/statement-iran-protest/iran-third-day-of-protests-and-uprisings-in-sanandaj-mahabad-and-karaj/\">several days of anti-government protests</a> took place after the death of Mahsa Amini.

(Iran is a heavily mobile-centric country, with <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/ir\">Cloudflare Radar</a> reporting that 85% of requests are made from mobile devices.) Internet traffic from Iran Mobile Communications Company (<a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/197207\">AS197207</a>) started to decline around 1530 UTC, and remained near zero until it started to recover at 2200 UTC, returning to “normal” levels by the end of the day.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3QHoVDCpjFvjoKtaXhpM02/40462ea850f6ece1b6b41b4988c65354/image1-37.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Internet traffic from RighTel (<a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/57218\">AS57218</a>) began to decline around 1630 UTC.

In Tehran Province, HTTP request volume declined by approximately 70% around 1600 UTC, and continued to drop for the next several hours before seeing a slight recovery at 2200 UTC, likely related to the recovery also seen at that time on AS197207.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1YQFzLkV4MltrV4UCNFlqy/c49ad2f73c0b35b81fb155d657d3c5c5/image6-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"800\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Similarly, Internet traffic volumes across the whole country began to decline just after 1600 UTC, falling approximately 40%. Nominal recovery at 2200 UTC is visible in this view as well, again likely from the increase in traffic from AS197207. More aggressive traffic growth is visible starting around 0500 UTC, after the remaining two mobile network providers came back online.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/ijiGPsKAsRgbsNn737wG7/9ac4ee7c9ed165efd15194a4f54108ff/image10-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"dns-blocking\">DNS blocking</h3>\n      <a href=\"#dns-blocking\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In addition to shutting down mobile Internet providers within the country, Iran’s government also reportedly <a href=\"https://iranwire.com/en/technology/107747-instagram-blocked-in-parts-of-iran/\">blocked access to social media platform Instagram</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenObservatory/status/1572548272132333571\">blocking access to DNS-over-HTTPS from open DNS resolver services</a> including <a href=\"https://www.quad9.net/\">Quad9</a>, Google’s <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns\">8.8.8.8</a>, and Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1\">1.1.1.1</a>.

This is clearly evident in the graph below, with resolution volume over DoH and DoT dropping to zero at 1940 UTC. The OONI tweet also noted that the 1.1.1.1 IP address “remains blocked on most networks.” The trend line for resolution over TCP or UDP (on port 53) in the graph below suggests that the IP address is not universally blocked, as there are still resolution requests reaching Cloudflare.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/FUtmgZFtnBt5msEe9ULer/e70e87f597982938f068145317846071/image4-12.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"961\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Interested parties can use <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> to monitor the impact of such government-directed Internet disruptions, and can follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar\">@CloudflareRadar</a> on Twitter for updates on Internet disruptions as they occur.</p>",
