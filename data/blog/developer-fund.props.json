Today we&#39;re taking another step toward that goal with the launch of the Cloudflare Apps Platform and the Cloudflare Developer Fund. To understand that, you have to understand where we started.</p><p>When we started Cloudflare we needed two things: a collection of users for the service, and finances to help us fund our development. In both cases, people were taking a risk on Cloudflare. Our first users came from <a href=\"http://www.projecthoneypot.org/\">Project Honey Pot</a>, which Lee Holloway and I created back in 2004. Members of that Open Source community use its service to track online hackers and spammers and many served as Cloudflare&#39;s initial alpha customers. We reached out to the project&#39;s users and they gave us feedback on how to make Cloudflare&#39;s nascent service valuable to them.</p><p>Once we proved the technology worked, we were fortunate to work with some of the Internet&#39;s best investors. <a href=\"http://www.venrock.com/\">Venrock</a>, which provided the first funding for companies like Apple and Intel; <a href=\"http://pelionvp.com/\">Pelion Ventures</a>, which was born out of networking giant Novell; and <a href=\"http://www.nea.com/\">NEA</a>, which has provided funding for some of the most successful startups in the last 25 years, all provided both financial resources and invaluable counsel as we built Cloudflare.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"running-at-the-edge\">Running at the Edge</h3>\n            <a href=\"#running-at-the-edge\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Prior to today, if you wanted to write code that took full advantage of Cloudflare&#39;s global network you needed to be a Cloudflare employee.

The Apps Platform allows third parties to develop applications that can be delivered across Cloudflare&#39;s edge to any of our millions of customers. When we started Cloudflare, we had the reach of the thousands of Project Honey Pot users. The Cloudflare Apps Platform amplifies this and gives developers the ability to reach any of Cloudflare&#39;s more than six million current users.</p><p>Cloudflare sits in a unique place. Our customers&#39; packets flow through our network before reaching origin servers and in the way back to clients. That enables us to filter out bad actors, introduce new compression, change protocols, and modify and inject content. The Cloudflare Apps Platform enables developers to do the same, and produce applications that help build a better Internet.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-funds-you-need\">The Funds You Need</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-funds-you-need\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>But access to users isn&#39;t enough to build a great company.
