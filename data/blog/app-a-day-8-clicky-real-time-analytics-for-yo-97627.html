		"A website without analytics is like a general engaging the opposition
		sans intelligence. Both result in losing battles."

	<p>Those are the words of Clicky, today's <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps" target="_blank">CloudFlare App</a> and a provider of real-time analytics for your website. We believe. Real time data is powerful, and a common request of CloudFlare customers. Rather than reinventing the wheel ourselves, we're pleased to integrate Clicky's real time view into your visitors in this seamless manner.</p>
	<p>With Clicky enabled, you will understand where your visitors are coming from and how they interact with your site. Accurate logs of every visitor and click on your website, combined with advanced segmentation and analysis tools, help you control the destiny of your website.</p>
	<h3 id="asweetdeal">A Sweet Deal</h3>
	<p>The Clicky plan for CloudFlare customers is extra sweet: <strong>$10/month for up to 50,000 pageviews/day</strong>. You may add Clicky on multiple sites on CloudFlare as long as the total daily pageviews stays below that number. When you toggle Clicky on in your CloudFlare dashboard, we'll give you a hint if we think your site is too large. Don't worry...in the very near future, CloudFlare will offer higher-volume plans for Clicky customers.</p>
	<p>Subscribe to Clicky [link removed] and start getting smarter about your website in real-time.</p>
