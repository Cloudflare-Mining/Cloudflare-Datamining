	<p><a href="http://jetpack.me">Jetpack</a> is an extremely popular plugin to provide self-hosted blogs with all of the <a href="http://jetpack.me/about">additional functionality</a> that WordPress provide to sites hosted with their own hosted platform at WordPress.com.</p>
	<p>Very recently, a serious security flaw in Jetpack was discovered. It has the potential to allow an attacker to complete actions on a blog without having to log in, such as posting. The WordPress team has written about the the problem <a href="http://jetpack.me/2014/04/10/jetpack-security-update">here</a>.</p>
	<p>This problem was assigned the CVE number <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0173">CVE-2014-0173</a> and is fixed in Jetpack 2.9.3 released today. Everyone using Jetpack on their WordPress site should update immediately.</p>
