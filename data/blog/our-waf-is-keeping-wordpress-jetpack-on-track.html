	<p>As we've said <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/wordpress-pingback-attacks-and-our-waf">before</a>, lots of our users run WordPress on their websites and its popularity makes it a big target. So when a new vulnerability is discovered, acting quickly is prudent.</p>

	<p><a href="http://jetpack.me" target="_blank">Jetpack</a> is an extremely popular plugin to provide self-hosted blogs with all of the <a href="http://jetpack.me/about/" target="_blank">additional functionality</a> that WordPress provide to sites hosted with their own hosted platform at WordPress.com.</p>
	<p>Very recently, a serious security flaw in Jetpack was discovered. It has the potential to allow an attacker to complete actions on a blog without having to log in, such as posting. The WordPress team has written about the the problem <a href="http://jetpack.me/2014/04/10/jetpack-security-update/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	<p>This problem was assigned the CVE number <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0173" target="_blank">CVE-2014-0173</a> and is fixed in Jetpack 2.9.3 released today. Everyone using Jetpack on their WordPress site should update immediately.</p>

	<p>All CloudFlare customers who use WordPress are automatically protected against this bug. We rolled out a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/waf" target="_blank">Web Application Firewall</a> (WAF) rule that is automatically enabled for all customers (free or paid) to protect against this problem.</p>
	<p><img alt="Jetpack 2.9.3" src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/Screen_Shot_2014-04-10_at_18.15.25.png"><noscript><img alt="Jetpack 2.9.3" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/Screen_Shot_2014-04-10_at_18.15.25.png"></noscript></p>
	<p>Customers using Jetpack should still upgrade immediately, but the WAF rule gives a little breathing space.</p>
