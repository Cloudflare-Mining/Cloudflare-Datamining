Making this possible requires a clever bit of cooperation to encode and deliver the files in a particular way, known as “chunked encoding.” This involves splitting up segments into smaller, bite-sized pieces, or “chunks”. Chunked encoding can typically bring live latency down to 5 or 10 seconds.</p><p>Confusingly, the word “chunk” is overloaded to mean two different things:</p><ol><li><p>CMAF or HLS chunks, which are small pieces of a segment (typically 1s) that are aligned on key frames</p></li><li><p>HTTP chunks, which are just a way of delivering any file over the web</p></li></ol>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1DXyeaG7liLUlMff7v32vq/c41187bfbb373e3af88da5e35570ea65/Chunked-Encoding.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"720\" height=\"64\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Chunked Encoding splits segments into shorter chunks</i></p><p>HTTP chunks are important because web clients have limited ability to process streams of data. Most clients can only work with data once they’ve received the full HTTP response, or at least a complete HTTP chunk. By using HTTP chunked transfer encoding, we enable video players to start parsing and decoding video sooner.</p><p>CMAF chunks are important so that decoders can actually <i>play</i> the bits that are in the HTTP chunks. Without encoding video in a careful way, decoders would have random bits of a video file that can’t be played.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"cdns-can-introduce-additional-buffering\">CDNs can introduce additional buffering</h3>\n            <a href=\"#cdns-can-introduce-additional-buffering\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Chunked encoding with HLS and CMAF is growing in use across the web today. Part of what makes this technique great is that HTTP chunked encoding is widely supported by CDNs – it’s been part of the HTTP spec for 20 years.</p><p>CDN support is critical because it allows low-latency live video to scale up and reach audiences of thousands or millions of concurrent viewers – something that’s currently very difficult to do with other, non-HTTP based protocols.</p><p>Unfortunately, even if you enable chunking to optimise delivery, your CDN may be working against you by buffering the entire segment. To understand why consider what happens when many people request a live segment at the same time:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/72cAKXFSt7jASVx88HncQH/89a290dda225ca112c04588071da6e25/Bulk-Request.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>If the file is already in cache, great! CDNs do a great job at delivering cached files to huge audiences. But what happens when the segment isn’t in cache yet? Remember – this is the typical request pattern for live video!</p><p>Typically, CDNs are able to “stream on cache miss” from the origin. That looks something like this:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/35E6JRDF51cSyaVMo1Rcuy/6ce28cba7705204a3354a75c98e5c495/Stream-On-Cache-Misse.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1280\" height=\"285\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>But again – what happens when multiple people request the file at once? CDNs typically need to <b>pull the entire file into cache before serving additional viewers</b>:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/Qx4ILMftvAnN3zSx0KEll/a67a1b52874e7b46d1680a4da956d3d0/One-at-a-Time.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Only one viewer can stream video, while other clients wait for the segment to buffer at the CDN</i></p><p>This behavior is understandable. CDN data centers consist of many servers. To avoid overloading origins, these servers typically coordinate amongst themselves using a “cache lock” (mutex) that allows only one server to request a particular file from origin at a given time. A side effect of this is that while a file is being pulled into cache, it can’t be served to any user other than the first one that requested it. Unfortunately, this cache lock also defeats the purpose of using chunked encoding!</p><p>To recap thus far:</p><ul><li><p>Chunked encoding splits up video segments into smaller pieces</p></li><li><p>This can reduce end-to-end latency by allowing chunks to be fetched and decoded by players, even while segments are being produced at the origin server</p></li><li><p>Some CDNs neutralize the benefits of chunked encoding by <b>buffering entire files inside the CDN</b> before they can be delivered to clients</p></li></ul>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"cloudflares-solution-concurrent-streaming-acceleration\">Cloudflare’s solution: Concurrent Streaming Acceleration</h3>\n            <a href=\"#cloudflares-solution-concurrent-streaming-acceleration\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As you may have guessed, we think we can do better.
