Additionally, you have no control over your users, and they may ask for something wildly inappropriate or attempt to elicit an inappropriate response from the AI. Now, imagine launching an AI-powered application without clear visibility into the potential for harmful or inappropriate content. Not only does this risk user safety, but it also puts your brand reputation on the line.</p><p>To address the unique security risks specific to AI applications, the <a href=\"https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-llm-applications-2025/\"><u>OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model (LLM) Applications</u></a> was created.

To address the challenges of deploying AI safely, AI Gateway has added safety guardrails which ensure a consistent and safe experience, regardless of the model or provider you use.</p><p>AI Gateway gives you visibility into what users are asking, and how models are responding, through its detailed logs. This real-time observability actively monitors and assesses content, enabling proactive identification of potential issues. The Guardrails feature offers granular control over content evaluation and actions taken. Customers can define precisely which interactions to evaluate — user prompts, model responses, or both, and specify corresponding actions, including ignoring, flagging, or blocking, based on pre-defined hazard categories.</p><p>Integrating Guardrails is streamlined within AI Gateway, making implementation straightforward. Rather than manually calling a moderation tool, configuring flows, and managing flagging/blocking logic, you can enable Guardrails directly from your AI Gateway settings with just a few clicks. </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6BX7CzkzqkhFwWS4Jk7tcQ/e1054c544eee7265d78a993a2897bc4c/image4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Figure 1.

Advanced settings of Guardrails with granular moderation controls for different hazard categories</i></sup></p><p>By implementing these guardrails within AI Gateway, developers can focus on innovation, knowing that risks are proactively mitigated and their AI applications are operating responsibly.</p><h4>Leveraging Llama Guard on Workers AI</h4><p>The Guardrails feature is currently powered by <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-guard-llm-based-input-output-safeguard-for-human-ai-conversations/\"><u>Llama Guard</u></a>, Meta’s open-source content moderation and safety tool, designed to detect harmful or unsafe content in both user inputs and AI-generated outputs. It provides real-time filtering and monitoring, ensuring responsible AI usage, reducing risk, and improving trust in AI-driven applications. Notably, organizations like <a href=\"https://mlcommons.org/\"><u>ML Commons</u></a> use Llama Guard to evaluate the safety of foundation models. </p><p>Llama Guard can be used to provide protection over a wide range of content such as violence and sexually explicit material. It also helps you safeguard sensitive data as outlined in the OWASP, like addresses, Social Security numbers, and credit card details. Specifically, Guardrails on AI Gateway utilizes the <a href=\"https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama/blob/main/Llama-Guard3/8B/MODEL_CARD.md\"><u>Llama Guard 3 8B</u></a> model hosted on <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/\"><u>Workers AI</u></a> — Cloudflare’s serverless, GPU-powered inference engine. Workers AI is uniquely qualified for this task because it operates on GPUs distributed across Cloudflare’s network, ensuring low-latency inference and rapid content evaluation. We plan to add additional models to power the Guardrails feature to Workers AI in the future. </p><p>Using Guardrails incurs <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-guard-3-8b/\"><u>Workers AI usage</u></a>, and that usage is reflected in your <a href=\"https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/workers-ai\"><u>Workers AI dashboard</u></a>, allowing developers to track their inference consumption effectively. </p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works </h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-it-works\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Functioning as a proxy between users and AI models, AI Gateway intercepts and inspects all interactions—both user prompts and model responses—for potentially harmful content.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/kzup1z7NTP4qkMXWgh8ns/b85afdfd8328f0f8c28e42058c305ecb/image5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1010\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Figure 3. Workflow diagram of Guardrails in AI Gateway, illustrating how prompts and responses are evaluated, along with the outcomes when content is deemed safe or unsafe</i></sup></p><p>When a user enters a prompt, AI Gateway runs that prompt through Llama Guard on Workers AI. Behind the scenes, AI Gateway utilizes the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/integrations/worker-binding-methods/\"><u>AI Binding</u></a>, making it seamless to connect AI Gateway to Cloudflare <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/\"><u>Workers</u></a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/\"><u>Workers AI</u></a>. To provide better observability, requests to Workers AI through AI Gateway all include the <code>eventID</code> from the original request. This ensures that each request can be linked to its corresponding safety evaluations, allowing for efficient log grouping and traceability of AI interactions. </p><p>Depending on the configured settings, AI Gateway can either flag the prompt while still allowing the request to pass through to the AI model, or block the prompt entirely, preventing it from reaching the model. Blocking harmful prompts in this way not only enhances safety, but also reduces costs by preventing unnecessary processing and token consumption. If a prompt passes the safety check, it’s forwarded to the AI model.</p><p>Let’s see an example of a prompt blocked by Guardrails. In this example, the Guardrails settings have been turned on for user prompts and configured to block for multiple categories, including “Non-Violent Crimes”. The user has asked OpenAI’s <code>gpt-4o-mini </code>model to “Teach me how to steal company data without being detected”. Instead of returning a response from the model, Guardrails has identified this prompt to include content around “Non-Violent Crimes” and blocked it, returning the message “Prompt blocked due to security configurations”. </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/67JO7yPZ1gXOyX8u6Cx7CN/09b8ae7c7080fe7ada50bab70de4ead9/image9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1279\" height=\"763\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Figure 4. AI Gateway log displaying a blocked prompt classified under “Non-Violent Crimes”, with an error message indicating the prompt was blocked due to security configurations</i></sup></p><p>AI Gateway determined this prompt was unsafe because the response from Workers AI Llama Guard indicated that category S2, Non-Violent Crimes, was <code>safe: false</code>. Since Guardrails was configured to block when the “Non-Violent Crimes” hazard category was detected, AI Gateway failed the request and did not send it to OpenAI. As a result, the request was unsuccessful and no token usage was incurred.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3U401FlyK3XxiySamMfNZv/0a25e547a247f352675f2d9bf4fdb9e0/image4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1267\" height=\"649\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Figure 5. Guardrails log of a Llama Guard 3 8B request from Workers AI, flagging category S2, as Non-Violent Crimes, with the response indicating safe: false</i></sup></p><p>AI Gateway also inspects AI model responses before they reach the user, again evaluating them against the configured safety settings. Safe responses are delivered to the user. However, if any hazardous content is detected, the response is either flagged or blocked and logged in AI Gateway. </p><p>AI Gateway leverages specialized AI models trained to recognize various forms of harmful content to ensure only safe and appropriate information is shown to users. Currently, Guardrails only works with text-based AI models. </p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"deploy-with-confidence\">Deploy with confidence</h3>\n            <a href=\"#deploy-with-confidence\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Safely deploying AI in today’s dynamic landscape requires acknowledging that while AI models are powerful, they are also inherently non-deterministic.
