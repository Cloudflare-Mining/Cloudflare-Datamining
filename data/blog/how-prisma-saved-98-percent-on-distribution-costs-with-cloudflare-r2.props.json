Prisma provides a server-side library that helps developers read and write data to the database in an intuitive, efficient and safe way.</i></p><p>Prisma’s mission is to redefine how developers build data-driven applications. At its core, Prisma provides an open-source, next-generation TypeScript Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that unlocks a new level of developer experience thanks to its intuitive data model, migrations, type-safety, and auto-completion.</p><p>Prisma ORM has experienced remarkable growth, engaging a vibrant community of developers. And while it was a great problem to have, this growth was causing an explosion in our AWS infrastructure costs. After investigating a wide range of alternatives, we went with Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/\">R2 storage</a> — and as a result are thrilled that our engine distribution costs have decreased by <i>98%,</i> while delivering top-notch performance.</p><p>It was a natural fit: Prisma is already a proud <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners/prisma/\">technology partner of Cloudflare’s</a>, offering deep database integration with Cloudflare Workers. And Cloudflare products provide much of the underlying infrastructure for <a href=\"https://www.prisma.io/accelerate\">Prisma Accelerate</a> and <a href=\"http://prisma.io/pulse\">Prisma Pulse</a>, empowering user-focused product development. In this post, we’ll dig into how we decided to extend our ongoing collaboration with Cloudflare to the Prisma ORM, and how we migrated from AWS S3 + CloudFront to Cloudflare R2, with zero downtime.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"distributing-the-prisma-orm-and-its-engines\">Distributing the Prisma ORM and its engines</h2>\n            <a href=\"#distributing-the-prisma-orm-and-its-engines\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Prisma ORM simplifies data access thanks to its type-safe <a href=\"https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client\">Prisma Client</a>, and enables efficient database management via the <a href=\"https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-cli\">Prisma CLI</a>, so that developers can focus on product development.</p><p>Both the Prisma Client and the Prisma CLI rely on the <a href=\"https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-engines#prisma-engines\">Prisma Engines</a>, which are implemented in Rust and distributed as platform-specific compiled binaries.

It offers robust blob storage compatible with S3 and leverages Cloudflare’s network for global low-latency distribution. Additionally, it has no egress costs, and is solely priced based on the total volume of data stored and operations on that data. Given our reliance on Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-product-portfolio/\"><b>product portfolio</b></a> for our <a href=\"https://console.prisma.io\"><b>Data Platform</b></a>, and extensive experience with their Workers platform, we already had high trust in the quality of Cloudflare’s products.</p><p>To finalize our decision, we implemented a test to confirm our intuitions about Cloudflare’s quality of service. We deployed a script to 50 cities across the globe, representative of our incoming traffic, to measure download latencies for our engine files (~15MB). The test was run multiple times, with latencies for the different <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/default-cache-behavior/#cloudflare-cache-responses\">cache statuses</a> recorded and compared against our previous AWS-based solution. The results confirmed that Cloudflare R2&#39;s reliability and performance were at least on par with AWS S3 + CloudFront. And because R2 is compatible with S3, we wouldn’t need to make substantial changes to our software in order to move over to Cloudflare. These were great results, and we couldn’t wait to switch!</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"our-solution-moving-to-cloudflares-r2\">Our solution: moving to Cloudflare’s R2</h2>\n            <a href=\"#our-solution-moving-to-cloudflares-r2\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>In order to move our engine file distribution to Cloudflare, we needed to ensure we could make the switch without any disruption or impact to our users.</p><p>While R2 URLs match S3&#39;s format, Prisma CLI uses a fixed domain to point to the engine file distribution. This fixed domain enabled us to transition without making any changes to the code of older Prisma versions, and simply point the existing URLs to R2. However, to make the transition, we needed to change our DNS configuration to point to Cloudflare. While this seems trivial, potential issues like unexpected DNS propagation challenges, or certificate validation problems when connecting via TLS, required us to plan ahead in order to proceed confidently and safely.</p><p>We modified the Prisma ORM release pipeline to upload assets to both S3 and R2, and used the <a href=\"/r2-super-slurper-ga/\">R2 Super Slurper</a> for migrating past engine versions to R2. This ensured all Prisma releases, past and future, existed in both places. We also established Grafana monitoring checks to pull engine files from R2, using a DNS and TLS configuration similar to our desired production setup, but via an experimental domain. Those monitoring checks were later reused during the final traffic cutover to ensure that there was no service disruption.</p><p>As ensuring no impact or disruption to our users was of utmost importance, we proceeded with a gradual rollout of the DNS changes using DNS load balancing, a method where a group of alias records assigned to a domain are weighted differently. This meant that the DNS resolver directed more traffic to heavier-weighted records. We began with a load balancing configuration simulating our old setup, with one record (the <i>control</i>) pointing to AWS CloudFront, and the other (the <i>candidate</i>) pointing to R2. Initially, all weight was on the <i>control</i>, effectively preserving the old routing to CloudFront. We also set the lowest TTL possible, so changes in the record weights took effect as soon as possible, creating more control over DNS propagation. Additionally, we implemented a health check that would redirect all traffic to the <i>control</i> if download latencies were significantly higher, or if errors were detected, ensuring a stable fallback.</p><p>At this point, everything was in place and we could start the rollout.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2O4inKFtr4vG45Z9I85MhS/8e3e7e292a13c725bd21e54925717ac4/3-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"607\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Our DNS load balancing setup during the rollout.

With as little as 5% traffic routed to Cloudflare, cache hit ratios neared 100%, as expected. Latencies matched the <i>control</i>, so the health checks were all good, and our fallback never activated. Over the duration of an hour, we gradually increased R2&#39;s DNS weight to manage 25%, 50%, and finally 100% of traffic, without any issues. The cutover could not have gone any smoother.</p><p>After monitoring for an additional two days, we simplified the DNS topology and routed to Cloudflare exclusively. We were extremely satisfied with the change, and started seeing our infrastructure costs drop considerably, as expected, not to mention the zero downtime and zero reported issues from users.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"a-success\">A success</h2>\n            <a href=\"#a-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Transitioning to Cloudflare R2 was easy thanks to their great product and tooling, intuitive platform and supportive team.
