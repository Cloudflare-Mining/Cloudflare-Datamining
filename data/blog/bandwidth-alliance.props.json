That means making the Internet faster, safer and smarter, but also more efficient alongside our cloud partners. As such, wherever we can, we&#39;re on the lookout for ways to help save our common customers money. That got us looking into why and how much cloud customers pay for bandwidth.</p><p>If you&#39;re hosting on most cloud providers, data transfer charges, sometimes known as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-are-data-egress-fees/\">&quot;bandwidth” or “egress” charges</a>, can be an integral part of your bill. These fees cover the cost of delivering traffic from the cloud all the way to the consumer. However, if you’re using a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/\">CDN</a> such as Cloudflare, the cost of data transfer comes in addition to the cost of content delivery.</p><p>In some cases, charging makes sense. If you&#39;re hosted in a facility in Ashburn, Virginia and someone visits your service from Sydney, Australia there are real costs to moving traffic between the two places. The cloud provider likely hands off traffic to a transit provider or uses its own global backbone to carry the traffic across the United States and then across the Pacific, potentially handing off to other transit providers along the way, until eventually handing it off to the visitor&#39;s ISP. Someone has to maintain the expensive infrastructure that hauls the traffic the 9,739 miles from Ashburn to Sydney. It makes sense for the cloud provider to charge a customer to cover the cost of that transit or their own backbone.  For example, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure both send traffic over their highly available, secure, performant backbones of terrestrial fiber, subsea cable and more.  </p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4VhNwiZsZLLYp73KqoqgZK/03482d7698c1b30a2dfff0daf481203a/bandwidth-alliance-header.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1159\" height=\"931\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>Peered Connections, Low Incremental Costs</h3><p>For nearly all major cloud providers, traffic that is delivered to users via Cloudflare, passes across a private network interface (PNI) or private interconnection. That PNI typically occurs within the same facility through a fiber optic cable between routers for the two networks. Unlike when there&#39;s a transit provider in between, there&#39;s no middleman so neither Cloudflare nor the cloud provider bears incremental costs for transferring the data over this PNI. Cloud providers use these PNI’s to extensively interconnect with third party networks including Cloudflare’s.</p><p>Cloudflare automatically carries traffic from the user’s location to the Cloudflare data center nearest your cloud provider and then over such PNIs. Cloudflare is one of the most peered networks in the world, allowing traffic to be carried over such free interconnected links. We at Cloudflare acknowledge that specific customers with highly distributed infrastructures and bandwidth requirements can find it daunting to orchestrate workloads across multiple providers, and so not all traffic passes over such PNIs.</p><p>This got us to wonder: could we potentially create a new model and provide our mutual customers with lower costs? We started talking to the most customer-friendly cloud providers that we exchange traffic with and proposed that we look at making our highly efficient and growing interconnects further benefit our mutual customers.</p><p>So today — on the eve of Cloudflare&#39;s 8th birthday — we&#39;re excited to announce the Bandwidth Alliance: a group of forward-thinking cloud and networking companies that are committed to providing the best and most cost-efficient experience for our mutual customers.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6XJJoBr1PTt5rhxC561FPs/f663ed08bf62be0b164c6ee8c9ded6ef/bandwidth-alliance-plug-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"515\" height=\"443\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>Google Cloud: Leaders In Customer-First Pricing</h3><p>Separately from our newly announced Bandwidth Alliance, we have been working with Google Cloud over the past three years as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/integrations/google-cloud/#cdn-interconnect-program\">part of their CDN Interconnect program</a>. That program, which Cloudflare has been a part of since its launch, discounts data transfer fees for mutual Cloudflare/Google Cloud customers by up to 75%. We have worked with Google Cloud to ensure that all our mutual customers now automatically get the discount on their bills without having to do anything. Thus, Google Cloud provides a reduced data transfer fee that will help customers save money in comparison to the standard data transfer fee and this is enabled by the high degree of settlement free peering with Cloudflare.</p><p>Microsoft Azure is working on its own CDN interconnect program. Cloudflare is excited to be part of this program and pass on the benefits to our mutual customers.</p><p>Thus, Google, and soon Microsoft Azure, provide a highly discounted data transfer fee that will help our mutual customers do more for less.</p><p>With the Bandwidth Alliance we wanted to go even further. First, beyond Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, we worked with several cloud and hosting providers including IBM Cloud to create a group of companies with whom you could get reduced data transfer fees. Second, we implemented a new smart routing system (to learn more read this <a href=\"/smart-routing-for-bandwidth-alliance\">technical blog post</a>) to ensure that all our customers’ traffic on participating cloud providers could qualify for this offer. And, finally, we agreed with many other cloud providers to not just discount, but to waive data transfer fees entirely for mutual customers.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1s1h7ouD4GCdl0nAxuXXhN/c2af10d0fd7333644a883ee42c729c49/multicloud-bandwidth-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1095\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>Founding Members of the Bandwidth Alliance</h3><p>We are proud to announce the following cloud providers and hosting companies who have joined together with us in committing to reduced or zero bandwidth rates for mutual customers.  </p><p>Below is the list of companies from whom you’ll be able to get discounted or eliminated bandwidth fees as a Cloudflare customer.
