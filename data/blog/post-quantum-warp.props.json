Unlike a server that we fully control and can hotfix at any time, our WARP client runs directly on end user devices. In fact, it runs on millions of end user devices that we do not control. This fundamental difference means that every time we update the WARP client, our release must work properly on the first try, with no room for error.</p><p>To make things even more challenging, we need to support the WARP client across five different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android/ChromeOS), while also ensuring consistency and reliability for both our consumer 1.1.1.1 WARP client and our Cloudflare One Agent. In addition, because the WARP client relies on the fairly new <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9298/\"><u>MASQUE protocol</u></a>, which the industry only standardized in August 2022, we need to be extra careful to make sure our upgrade to post-quantum key agreement does not expose latent bugs or instabilities in the MASQUE protocol itself. </p><p>All these challenges point to a slow and careful transition to PQC in the WARP client, while still supporting customers that want to immediately activate PQC. To accomplish this, we used three techniques: </p><ol><li><p>temporary PQC downgrades, </p></li><li><p>gradual rollout across our WARP client population, and</p></li><li><p>a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management\"><u>Mobile Device Management (MDM)</u></a> override. </p></li></ol><p>Let’s take a deep dive into each. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"temporary-pqc-downgrades\">Temporary PQC downgrades</h3>\n      <a href=\"#temporary-pqc-downgrades\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>As we roll out PQ key agreement in MASQUE to the WARP client, we want to make sure we don’t have WARP clients that struggle to connect due to an error, middlebox, or a latent implementation bug triggered by our PQC migration. One way to accomplish this level of robustness is to have clients downgrade to a classic cryptographic connection if they fail to negotiate a PQ connection.</p><p>To really understand this strategy, we need to review the concept of <b>cryptographic downgrades</b>. In cryptography, a <b>downgrade attack</b> is a cyber attack where an attacker forces a system to abandon a secure cryptographic algorithm in favor of an older, less secure, or even unencrypted one that allows the attacker to introspect on the communications. Thus, when newly rolling out a PQ encryption, it is standard practice to ensure that: if the client and server <i>both </i>support PQ encryption, it should not be possible for an attacker to downgrade their connection to a classic encryption. </p><p>Thus, to prevent downgrade attacks, we should ensure that if the client and server both support PQC, but fail to negotiate a PQC connection, then the connection will just fail. However, while this prevents downgrade attacks, it also creates problems with robustness.</p><p>We cannot have both robustness (i.e. the ability for client to downgrade to a classical connection if the PQC fails) and security against downgrades (i.e. the client is forbidden to downgrade to classical cryptography once it supports PQC) at the same time. We have to choose one. For this reason, we opted for a phased approach.</p><ul><li><p><b>Phase 1: Automated PQC downgrades.</b> We start by choosing robustness at the cost of providing security against downgrade attacks.  In this phase, we support automated PQC downgrades — if a client fails to negotiate a PQC connection, it will downgrade to classical cryptography. That way, if there are bugs or other instability introduced by PQC, the client automatically downgrades to classical cryptography and the end user will not experience any issues. (Note: because MASQUE establishes a single very long-lived TLS connection only when the user logs in, an end user is unlikely to notice a downgrade.) </p></li><li><p><b>Phase 2: PQC with security against downgrades. </b>Then, once the rollout is stable and we are convinced that there are no issues interfering with PQC, we will choose security against downgrade attacks over robustness. In this phase, if a client fails to negotiate a PQC connection, the connection will just fail, which provides security against downgrade attacks.</p></li></ul><p>To implement this phased approach, we introduced an API flag that the client uses to determine how it should initiate TLS handshakes, which has three states:</p><ul><li><p><b>No PQC: </b>The client initiates a TLS handshake using classical cryptography only. .</p></li><li><p><b>PQC downgrades allowed:</b> The client initiates a TLS handshake using post-quantum key agreement. If the PQC handshake negotiation fails, the client downgrades to classical cryptography.

Thus, initially the API flag is set to “No PQC” for our entire client population, and we gradually turn on the “PQC downgrades allowed” across groups of clients. As we do this, we monitor whether any clients downgrade from PQC to classical cryptography. At the time of this writing, we have completed the Phase 1 rollout to all of our consumer WARP (1.1.1.1) clients. We expect to complete Phase 1 for our Cloudflare One Agent by the end of 2025.</p><p>Downgrades are not expected during Phase 1. In fact, downgrades indicate that there may be a latent issue that we have to fix. If you are using a WARP client and encounter issues that you believe might be related to PQC, you can let us know by using the feedback button in the WARP client interface (by clicking the bug icon in the top-right corner of the WARP client application). Enterprise users can also file a support ticket for the Cloudflare One Agent.</p><p>We plan to enter Phase 2 — where the API flag is set to “PQC only” in order to provide security against downgrade attacks — by summer of mid 2026. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"mdm-override\">MDM override</h3>\n      <a href=\"#mdm-override\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Finally, we know that some of our customers may not be willing to wait for us to complete this careful upgrade to PQC. So, those customers can activate PQC right now. </p><p>We’ve built a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management\"><u>Mobile Device Management (MDM)</u></a> override for the Cloudflare One Agent. MDM allows organizations to centrally manage, monitor, and secure mobile devices that access corporate resources; it works on multiple types of devices, not just mobile devices. The override for the Cloudflare One Agent allows an administrator (with permissions to manage the device) to turn on PQC. To use the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/#enable_post_quantum\"><u>MDM post-quantum override</u></a>, set the ‘enable_post_quantum’ MDM flag to true. This flag takes precedence over the signal from the API flag we described earlier, and will activate PQC without downgrades. With this setting, the client will only negotiate a PQC connection. And if the PQC negotiation fails, the connection will fail, which provides security against downgrade attacks. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"ciphersuites-fips-and-fedramp\">Ciphersuites, FIPS and Fedramp </h2>\n      <a href=\"#ciphersuites-fips-and-fedramp\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (<a href=\"https://www.fedramp.gov/\"><u>FedRAMP</u></a>) is a U.S. government standard for securing federal data in the cloud. <a href=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7wOGN7Ua9rvgzlQAwlFZ6y/324506e91b62aa4de55bcb2ceb5d8ee8/Cloudflare-s_Unique_FedRAMP_Architecture.pdf\"><u>Cloudflare has a FedRAMP certification</u></a> that requires that we use cryptographic ciphersuites that comply with <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/federal_information_processing_standard\"><u>FIPS</u></a> (Federal Information Processing Standards) for certain products that are inside our FIPS boundary.</p><p>Because the WARP client is inside Cloudflare’s FIPS boundary for our <a href=\"https://www.fedramp.gov/\"><u>FedRAMP</u></a> certification, we had to ensure it uses FIPS-compliant cryptography.

To that end, we’re proud to help shoulder the burden of the Internet’s upgrade to PQC.</p><p>A powerful strategy is to use tunnels protected by post-quantum key agreement to protect Internet traffic, in bulk, from harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks – even if the individual connections sent through the tunnel have not yet been upgraded to PQC. Eventually, we will upgrade these tunnels to also support post-quantum signatures and certificates, to stop active attacks by adversaries armed with quantum computers after Q-Day.</p><p>This staged approach keeps up with Internet standards. And the use of tunnels provides customers and end users with built-in <i>cryptographic agility</i>, so they can easily adapt to changes in the cryptographic landscape without a major architectural overhaul.</p><p>Cloudflare’s WARP client is just the latest tunneling technology that we’ve upgraded to post-quantum key agreement.
