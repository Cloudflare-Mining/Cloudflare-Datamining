While some of the entries have their genesis in information from social media posts made by local telecommunications providers or civil society organizations, others are based on an internal traffic anomaly detection and alerting tool. Today, we’re adding this alerting feed to Cloudflare Radar, showing country and network-level traffic anomalies on the CROC as they are detected, as well as making the feed available via <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-get-traffic-anomalies\">API</a>.</p><p>Building on this new functionality, as well as the <a href=\"/route-leak-detection-with-cloudflare-radar/\">route leaks</a> and <a href=\"/bgp-hijack-detection/\">route hijacks insights</a> that we recently launched <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing\">on Cloudflare Radar</a>, we are also launching new Radar notification functionality, enabling you to subscribe to notifications about traffic anomalies, confirmed Internet outages, route leaks, or route hijacks. Using the <a href=\"https://dash.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare dashboard’s</a> existing notification functionality, users can set up notifications for one or more countries or autonomous systems, and receive notifications when a relevant event occurs. Notifications may be sent via e-mail or webhooks — the available delivery methods <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/\">vary according to plan level</a>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"traffic-anomalies\">Traffic anomalies</h3>\n      <a href=\"#traffic-anomalies\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Internet traffic generally follows a fairly regular pattern, with daily peaks and troughs at roughly the same volumes of traffic. However, while weekend traffic patterns may look similar to weekday ones, their traffic volumes are generally different. Similarly, holidays or national events can also cause traffic patterns and volumes to differ significantly from “normal”, as people shift their activities and spend more time offline, or as people turn to online sources for information about, or coverage of, the event. These traffic shifts can be newsworthy, and we have covered some of them in past Cloudflare blog posts (<a href=\"/how-the-coronation-of-king-charles-iii-affected-internet-traffic/\">King Charles III coronation</a>, <a href=\"/easter-passover-ramadan-internet-trends-2023/\">Easter/Passover/Ramadan</a>, <a href=\"/how-the-brazilian-presidential-elections-affected-internet-traffic/\">Brazilian presidential elections</a>).</p><p>However, as you also know from reading our <a href=\"/tag/outage/\">blog posts</a> and following <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar\">Cloudflare Radar</a> on social media, it is the more drastic drops in traffic that are a cause for concern. Some are the result of infrastructure damage from severe weather or a natural disaster like an earthquake and are effectively unavoidable, but getting timely insights into the impact of these events on Internet connectivity is valuable from a communications perspective. Other traffic drops have occurred when an authoritarian government orders mobile Internet connectivity to be shut down, or shuts down all Internet connectivity nationwide. Timely insights into these types of anomalous traffic drops are often critical from a human rights perspective, as Internet shutdowns are often used as a means of controlling communication with the outside world.</p><p>Over the last several months, the Cloudflare Radar team has been using an internal tool to identify traffic anomalies and post alerts for followup to a dedicated chat space. The companion blog post <a href=\"/detecting-internet-outages\"><i>Gone Offline: Detecting Internet Outages</i></a> goes into deeper technical detail about our traffic analysis and anomaly detection methodologies that power this internal tool.</p><p>Many of these internal traffic anomaly alerts ultimately result in Outage Center entries and Cloudflare Radar social media posts. Today, we’re extending the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center\">Cloudflare Radar Outage Center</a> and publishing information about these anomalies as we identify them. As shown in the figure below, the new <b>Traffic anomalies</b> table includes the type of anomaly (location or ASN), the entity where the anomaly was detected (country/region name or autonomous system), the start time, duration, verification status, and an “Actions” link, where the user can view the anomaly on the relevant entity traffic page or subscribe to a notification. (If manual review of a detected anomaly finds that it is present in multiple Cloudflare traffic datasets and/or is visible in third-party datasets, such as Georgia Tech’s <a href=\"https://ioda.live/\">IODA</a> platform, we will mark it as verified. Unverified anomalies may be false positives, or related to Netflows collection issues, though we endeavor to minimize both.)</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4avPigfW9GjhqKlH4U9XI2/35b3761b52b9046ed4fa03c6b68db4c1/pasted-image-0-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1165\" height=\"492\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In addition to this new table, we have updated the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center\">Cloudflare Radar Outage Center</a> map to highlight where we have detected anomalies, as well as placing them into a broader temporal context in a new timeline immediately below the map. Anomalies are represented as orange circles on the map, and can be hidden with the toggle in the upper right corner. Double-bordered circles represent an aggregation across multiple countries, and zooming in to that area will ultimately show the number of anomalies associated with each country that was included in the aggregation. Hovering over a specific dot in the timeline displays information about the outage or anomaly with which it is associated.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3fqllfaS5B100bVx1f58w0/d1c4f33c47d8d9271f4c3cf77d0688a3/pasted-image-0--1--6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1164\" height=\"817\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Internet outage information has been available via the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-get-annotations-outages\">Radar API</a> since we launched the Outage Center and API in September 2022, and traffic anomalies are now available through a <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-get-traffic-anomalies\">Radar API endpoint</a> as well.

And civil society organizations can use the information to inform action plans aimed at maintaining communications and protecting human rights in areas of conflict or instability. With the new notifications functionality also being launched today, you can subscribe to be notified about observed traffic anomalies, confirmed Internet outages, route leaks, or route hijacks, at a country or autonomous system level.

No purchase of Cloudflare services is necessary — just a verified email address is required to set up an account. While we would have preferred to not require a login, it enables us to take advantage of Cloudflare’s existing notifications engine, allowing us to avoid having to dedicate time and resources to building a separate one just for Radar. If you don’t already have a Cloudflare account, visit <a href=\"https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up\">https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up</a> to create one. Enter your username and a unique strong password, click “Sign Up”, and follow the instructions in the verification email to activate your account. (Once you’ve activated your account, we also suggest activating <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-two-factor-authentication/\">two-factor authentication (2FA)</a> as an additional security measure.)</p><p>Once you have set up and activated your account, you are ready to start creating and configuring notifications. The first step is to look for the Notifications (bullhorn) icon – the presence of this icon means that notifications are available for that metric — in the Traffic, Routing, and Outage Center sections on Cloudflare Radar. If you are on a country or ASN-scoped traffic or routing page, the notification subscription will be scoped to that entity.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2pthIoKtBxP566BiMTmIo7/f59c76a18de0f8d3f4f3ce8f020edbfb/image3-23.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"367\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Look for this icon in the Traffic, Routing, and Outage Center sections of Cloudflare Radar to start setting up notifications.</i></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7BzESdUYejnGYbyOELT3xb/2f71cc74d0f760efe24ead5ef5aef5d9/pasted-image-0--2--4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1154\" height=\"264\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>In the Outage Center, click the icon in the “Actions” column of an Internet outages table entry to subscribe to notifications for the related location and/or ASN(s).
