		powerful and important force the Internet is, and yet how fragile our
		access to it can be. The thoughts of the CloudFlare team are with the
		citizens of Egypt. We're all hoping for a swift and peaceful end to the
		conflict and that we start seeing Egyptian visitors to our network and
		the rest of the web again very soon.
