This begs the question, why are remote browsers not a common technology used by everyone?</p><p>The answer is — historically flawed execution. Everyone relies on web browsers for the majority of their work and any impact to user experience or performance can at best mean productivity losses and at worst outright rejection of the solution.</p><p>Unreliable rendering and poor performance in legacy browser isolation solutions has led IT organizations to reserve the enhanced security posture only for highly targeted users or activities. Much like trusting networks through the castle-and-moat model, assuming some users or websites are not phishing or malware vectors leaves an open door to attack.</p><p>Cloudflare Browser Isolation is built on top of Chromium (the same engine that powers other popular web browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Brave Browser). This, combined with our novel <a href=\"/cloudflare-and-remote-browser-isolation/\">Network Vector Rendering</a> technique, ensures that web pages are safely and consistently rendered even as web technologies evolve and become more complex.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"remote-browsers-must-be-fast\">Remote Browsers Must Be Fast</h3>\n      <a href=\"#remote-browsers-must-be-fast\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Legacy browser isolation solutions are hamstrung by their fundamental technology or the network they operate on. These old solutions rely on high-latency and bandwidth-heavy pixel pushing, or fragile content-disarm and reconstruction techniques that degrade performance, break websites, and might miss a malicious payload in the process.</p><p>Network Vector Rendering allows us to deliver a safe view of a remote webpage without high bandwidth usage or degraded image quality, but it is one part of the solution. By leveraging our global network we position remote browsers close to everyone connected to the Internet. This allows us to deliver a responsive, low latency stream of the webpage regardless of where you are physically located.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/14hVfWbzFCUuQBFVWj4obN/800fc77266678170d7746dfe8f17d75f/image1-35.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1500\" height=\"948\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Running a web browser on powerful servers connected to the backbone of the Internet introduces a powerful performance benefit. By sending minimal draw commands over the last mile wire, users with low bandwidth Internet connections enjoy a faster more responsive Internet.</p><p>Combine a massive, smart, distributed network with our patented super fast, lightweight Network Vector Rendering technology, and the result is remote browsing technology liberated from legacy constraints — providing crisp isolated pages to any user, on any device, anywhere in the world.</p><p>One of the advantages of using Browser Isolation is it reduces the local web browser’s burden downloading modern web pages. According to the FCC nearly 30 million Americans do not have access to broadband Internet (<a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/about-fcc/fcc-initiatives/bridging-digital-divide-all-americans\">source</a>). Modern websites are not optimised for low bandwidth connections typically requiring the download of hundreds of objects. Cloudflare’s remote browsers are connected to the backbone of the Internet and able to consistently download websites at broadband speeds, leveling the field for users on low-bandwidth Internet connections.</p><p>Here’s an example of a web page loading on a slow Internet connection compared with and without Browser Isolation. We are excited to see Browser Isolation bridging the digital divide and making the Internet faster for under-served Internet users.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 66.66666666666666%;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframe.videodelivery.net/f3b7ffbe1eba370b4ee28d509fef918a?preload=true\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\"  allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<p><i>Note: Timing is measured from the start of web page download until the webpage has triggered it’s on-load signal.</i></p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"remote-browsers-must-be-easy-to-use\">Remote Browsers Must Be Easy to Use</h3>\n      <a href=\"#remote-browsers-must-be-easy-to-use\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Browser Isolation products are typically <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/how-to-implement-zero-trust/\">implemented</a> either as add-on network appliances (such as a virtual machine or firewall box) or by changing the user’s preferred browser.
