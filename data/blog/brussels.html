	<p>Our week begins in Brussels, where we announce our newest data center. This is our 23rd data center in Europe alone, and our 81st data center globally - providing additional redundancy to nearby facilities in <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/people-just-liked-it-better-that-way/">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ohh-la-la-cloudflare-paris-data-center-goes-l/">Paris</a>.</p>
	<p>Millions of websites using CloudFlare are now faster in Brussels, and we are excited to exchange traffic at the <a href="https://bnix.net/" target="_blank">Belgium National Internet Exchange (BNIX)</a>.</p>

		Brussels - which hosts several strategic European institutions such as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/" target="_blank">European Commission</a> and the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/" target="_blank">Council of the European Union</a> - is home to over 40,000 EU employees. With the turn up of our Brussels data center, they join the rest of the country in experiencing a faster Internet. Impressively, close to 90% of Belgium's citizens are online.</p>
	<h3 id="twomorecities">Two more cities</h3>
	<p>We will be announcing two more data centers this week - each in one of the world’s most populous countries. Could you guess which ones?</p>
