As CloudFlare has grown we&#39;ve brought on line systems capable of absorbing and <i>accurately measuring</i> attacks. Since we don&#39;t need to resort to crude techniques to block traffic we can measure and filter attacks with accuracy. Our systems sort bad packets from good, keep websites online and keep track of attack packet rates and bits per second.</p><p>The current spate of large attacks are all layer 3 (L3) DDoS. Layer 3 attacks consist of a large volume of packets hitting the target network, and the aim is usually to overwhelm the target network hardware or connectivity.</p><p>L3 attacks are dangerous because most of the time the only solution is to acquire large network capacity and buy beefy networking hardware, which is simply not an option for most independent website operators. Or, faced with huge packet rates, some providers simply turn off connections or entirely block IP addresses.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"a-typical-day-at-cloudflare\">A Typical Day At CloudFlare</h3>\n      <a href=\"#a-typical-day-at-cloudflare\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Historically, L3 attacks were the biggest headache for CloudFlare.

These new attacks are interesting for a couple of reasons. First, the spikes align with the weekends. It seems the attackers are busy with something else during the week. Second, they are targeting a couple of fairly benign websites—this demonstrates that <i>anybody</i> can become the target of a large attack. Third, the overall volume of the attack is enormous.</p><p>Let me elaborate on this last point.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"bgp-black-holes\">BGP Black Holes</h3>\n      <a href=\"#bgp-black-holes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>When operating at a smaller scale, it’s not unusual for a DDoS attack to overwhelm the capacity of the target network. This causes network congestion and forces the operators of the attacked network to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_(networking)\">black hole</a> the attacked IP addresses, pretty much removing them from the Internet.</p><p>After that happens, it’s impossible to report the volume of the attack. The attack traffic will disappear in a “black hole” and is invisible to the operators of the attacked network.

Without our automatic mitigation system and network team, dealing with attacks of this size would not be possible.</p><p>You might think that as CloudFlare grows, the relative scale of attacks will shrink in comparison to legitimate traffic. The funny thing is, the opposite is true. Every time we upgrade our network capacity, we see larger attacks because we don’t have to resort to blackholing. With more capacity, we’re able to withstand and accurately measure even bigger attacks.</p><p>Interested in dealing with the largest DDoS attacks in the world? <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/join-our-team/\">We’re hiring</a> in San Francisco, London, and Singapore.</p>",
