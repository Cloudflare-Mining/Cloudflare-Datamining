In that context, it means that the artwork you see at the <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/\"><u>Met</u></a> in New York really came from the artist in question and isn’t a fake. Its provenance is how that piece of physical art changed possession over time, from the original artist all the way to the museum. </p><p>Digital content provenance builds upon this concept. It helps you understand how a piece of digital media — images, videos, PDFs, and more — was created and subsequently edited. The provenance of a photo I posted on Instagram might look like this: I took the picture with my iPhone, performed an auto-magic edit using Apple Photos’ editing tools, uploaded it to Instagram, cropped it using Instagram’s editing tools, and then posted it. </p><p>Why does digital content provenance matter? At a fundamental level, it’s an important way to give content creators credit for their work. Many photographers have had the experience of seeing their photograph or video go viral online, but with their name and attribution stripped away. In that scenario, the opportunities that might have accrued to the creator once the world saw their work don’t materialize. If you help ensure an artist or content creator gets credit for their work, that exposure could result in more career opportunities. </p><p>Digital content provenance can also be an important tool in understanding the world around us. If you see a video or a photo of a newsworthy event, you’d like to know if that photo was really taken at that particular location, or if it was from years prior at a different location. If you see a grainy picture of a UFO flying over New Jersey, knowing when and where that photo was taken is helpful information in understanding what is actually happening. </p><p>The C2PA is a project of the non-profit <a href=\"https://jointdevelopment.org/\"><u>Joint Development Foundation</u></a> and has developed technical specifications for attaching digital content provenance to a piece of media. The standards also specify how to cryptographically sign that manifest, thereby allowing anyone to verify that the manifest hasn&#39;t been tampered with. The JSON manifests and the associated signatures are together referred to as<b> </b><a href=\"https://contentcredentials.org/\"><b><u>Content Credentials</u></b></a>.</p><p>The Adobe-led <a href=\"https://contentauthenticity.org/\"><u>Content Authenticity Initiative</u></a>, which has thousands of members across a variety of industries, aims to drive global adoption of Content Credentials. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"why-integrate-content-credentials-into-cloudflare-images\">Why integrate Content Credentials into Cloudflare Images?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#why-integrate-content-credentials-into-cloudflare-images\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/cloudflare-images/\"><u>Cloudflare Images</u></a> allows you to build an effortlessly scalable and cost-effective image pipeline. With our new Content Credentials integration, you can now preserve existing Content Credentials, ensuring they remain intact from creation all the way to end-user delivery.</p><p>Many media organizations across the globe, such as the BBC, the New York Times, and Dow Jones, are members of the <a href=\"https://contentauthenticity.org/\"><u>Content Authenticity Initiative</u></a>. Imagine one of these news organizations wanted to include the Content Credentials of their photojournalist’s photos and allow anyone to verify the provenance of that image. Before now, even if the news organization was using a C2PA-compliant <a href=\"https://www.nikonusa.com/press-room/nikon-develops-firmware-that-adds-function-compliant-with-cp2a-standards-to-z6iii\"><u>camera</u></a> and <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-cc/using/content-credentials.html\"><u>editing flow</u></a>, these credentials would frequently be stripped if the image was transformed by their <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/\"><u>CDN</u></a>.</p><p>If you use Cloudflare, that is now a solved problem. In Cloudflare Images, you can now preserve Content Credentials when transforming images from remote sources. Enabling this integration will retain any existing Content Credentials that are embedded in the image.</p><p>When you use Images to resize or change the file format to your images, these transformations will be cryptographically signed by Cloudflare. This ensures, for example, that the end-user who sees the photograph on your website can use an open-source verification service such as <a href=\"https://contentcredentials.org/verify\"><u>contentcredentials.org/verify </u></a> to verify the full provenance chain. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-it-works\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Imagine you are a photojournalist using <a href=\"https://www.nikonusa.com/press-room/nikon-develops-firmware-that-adds-function-compliant-with-cp2a-standards-to-z6iii\"><u>a Nikon camera that has C2PA-compliant signing</u></a>.

This is included as a separate, independent assertion about this particular photograph. </p><p>Notice how there are two cryptographic signatures in this manifest, each referenced by <code>signature_info</code>. Since there were two entities involved in this example image — Nikon for the image’s creation, then Cloudflare for resizing it — both Nikon and Cloudflare independently signed their respective assertions about the content provenance.  </p><p>In this example, the signature reference looks like this: </p>\n            <pre class=\"language-JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">&quot;signature_info&quot;: {\n        &quot;issuer&quot;: &quot;Cloudflare, Inc&quot;,\n        &quot;time&quot;: &quot;2025-01-10T12:05:00Z&quot;,\n        &quot;cert_fingerprint&quot;: &quot;fedcba9876543210&quot;</pre></code>\n            <p>During the creation, editing, and resizing process of a piece of digital content, a unique hash of metadata is created for each action and then signed using a private key. The signature, along with the signer’s public certificate or reference to it, are contained in the JUMBF container as referenced by this JSON. </p><p>These hashes and signatures allow any open source verification tool to recalculate the hash, validate it against the signature, and check the certificate chain to ensure trustworthiness for each action taken on the image. This is what is meant by Content Credentials being tamper-evident: if any of these hashes and signatures fail to validate, it means that the metadata has been tampered with. </p><p>Each cryptographic signature is part of a <a href=\"https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/verify-known-cert-list/\"><u>Trust List</u></a>, allowing anyone to verify the provenance chain across various entities, such as from a camera manufacturer to photo editing software to distribution across Cloudflare. <a href=\"https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/manifest/signing-manifests\"><u>More from the Content Authenticity Initiative</u></a>: </p><blockquote><p><i>Trust lists connect the end-entity certificate that signed a manifest back to the originating root CA. This is accomplished by supplying the subordinate public X.509 certificates forming the trust chain (the public X.509 certificate chain).</i></p></blockquote><p>In order for Cloudflare to append the Content Credentials with any transformations, we needed to have a publicly available end-entity certificate and join this Trust List. Here we used DigiCert for our end-entity certificate and reference this certificate in the JSON manifests that we are now creating in production:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">&quot;signature_info&quot;: {\n        &quot;alg&quot;: &quot;sha256&quot;,\n        &quot;issuer&quot;: &quot;Cloudflare, Inc&quot;,\n        &quot;cert_serial_number&quot;: &quot;073E9F61ADE599BE128B02EDC5BD2BDE&quot;,\n        &quot;time&quot;: &quot;2024-01-06T22:42:36+00:00&quot;\n      },</pre></code>\n            <p>The end result is that news organizations, journalists, and content companies can now create an auditable chain of digital provenance whose claims can be verified using public-key cryptography.  </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"lets-see-an-example\">Let’s see an example</h3>\n      <a href=\"#lets-see-an-example\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Earlier this year, OpenAI announced their <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/\"><u>support for including Content Credentials in DALL-E</u></a>.
