	<p>Perimeter based security models are breaking under pressure</p>
	<p>The rapid transition to remote work and the rise of SaaS applications has disrupted how businesses need to think about protecting their networks. Organizations historically protected their sensitive applications and networks by building a “castle-and-moat”, piecing together disparate point solutions for each defensive layer.</p>
	<p>Comprehensive solutions require a layered defensive architecture for Internet security (DNS and HTTPS filtering), endpoint and data protection (Remote Browser Isolation and Data-Loss Prevention) as well as SaaS app security (CASB) and connecting users both in-and-away from the office via private network connections. This model is difficult to implement and manage, and doesn’t scale in the modern workplace with users and applications residing everywhere that is connected to the Internet.</p>
	<p>Why <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> is a must-have:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Apps can now live anywhere on-prem, cloud or SaaS</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Employees can access those resources from anywhere</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Attacks are getting more sophisticated constantly</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Internet is the new ‘Office’ away from ‘Castle-Moat’ model</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
