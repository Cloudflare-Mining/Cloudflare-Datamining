Early in the pandemic, as organizations had to quickly implement work-from-home solutions, new risks stemmed from this shift.</p><p>In our conversations with partners and participants, we noticed a theme. The digital divide in terms of cyber security products on the market and the “one size fits all” model mean that only large enterprises with a dedicated security team and extensive budgets have the ability to keep their internal resources and data secure. For Project Galileo, we <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/project-galileo-case-studies/\">work with a range of organizations</a> that vary in size, internal capacity, and technical expertise. Especially since many of these groups rely on their online presence to collect donations, organize volunteers, and promote their mission, one size fits all security products do not match the needs and expertise for these groups.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"announcing-new-zero-trust-tools-for-project-galileo-participants\">Announcing new Zero Trust tools for Project Galileo participants</h3>\n      <a href=\"#announcing-new-zero-trust-tools-for-project-galileo-participants\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>With this, we have extended our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust</a> products to all domains under Project Galileo, as we want organizations to have access to Enterprise-level cyber security products no matter their size and budgets. Zero Trust security means that no one is trusted by default from inside or outside the network, and verification is required from everyone trying to gain access to resources on the network. This allows organizations of any size to solve the common security problems such as data loss, malware and phishing so these organizations can focus on their unique missions.</p><p>For Impact Week, we are excited to share how Project Galileo participants and partners use Cloudflare’s Zero Trust products to keep their operations running smoothly.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"cyberpeace-institute\">CyberPeace Institute</h3>\n      <a href=\"#cyberpeace-institute\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/60mcA2TKwa7B79mVOGq8OG/678b5d02f373deeed21c5133f94451f7/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1516\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We started partnering with the CyberPeace Institute for Project Galileo in 2022.
