	<p>Developer Week 2023 is officially a wrap. Last week, we shipped 34 posts highlighting what has been going on with our developer platform and where we’re headed in the future – including new products &amp; features, in-depth tutorials to help you get started, and customer stories to inspire you.</p>
	<p>We’ve loved already hearing feedback from you all about what we’ve shipped:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>🤯 Serverless machine learning deployments - OMG! We used to need a team of devops to deploy a todo list MVP, it’s now 3 clicks with workers. They’re gonna do the same with ML workloads. Just like that. Boom. <a href="https://t.co/AcKUQ79fv0">https://t.co/AcKUQ79fv0</a></p>
