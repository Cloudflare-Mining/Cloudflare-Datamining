VoIP is flexible, scalable, and has been especially useful in bringing people together remotely during the pandemic.</p><p>A key protocol behind most VoIP calls is the heavily adopted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol\">Session Initiation Protocol</a> (SIP). SIP was originally defined in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2543\">RFC-2543</a> (1999) and designed to serve as a flexible and modular protocol for initiating calls (“sessions”), whether voice or video, or two-party or multiparty.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"speed-is-key-for-voip\">Speed is key for VoIP</h2>\n      <a href=\"#speed-is-key-for-voip\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Real-time communication between people needs to feel natural, immediate and responsive. Therefore, one of the most important features of a good VoIP service is speed. The user experiences this as natural sounding audio and high definition video, without lag or stutter. Users’ perceptions of call quality are typically closely measured and tracked using metrics like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_Evaluation_of_Speech_Quality\">Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_opinion_score\">Mean Opinion Scores</a>. While SIP and other VoIP protocols can be implemented using <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/\">TCP</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/\">UDP</a> as the underlying protocols, UDP is typically chosen because it’s faster for routers and servers to process them.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1AmGmFZIFpA4s42yh86k9z/47d171fcc57bc62e711e79efc423c979/pasted-image-0--1-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1638\" height=\"1044\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>UDP is a protocol that is unreliable, stateless and comes with no Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. What this means is that the routers and servers typically use less memory and computational power to process UDP packets and therefore can process more packets per second. Processing packets faster results in quicker assembly of the packets’ payloads (the encoded media), and therefore a better call quality.</p><p>Under the guidelines of <i>faster is better</i>, VoIP servers will attempt to process the packets as fast as possible on a first-come-first-served basis. Because UDP is stateless, it doesn’t know which packets belong to existing calls and which attempt to initiate a new call. Those details are in the SIP headers in the form of requests and responses which are not processed until further up the network stack.</p><p>When the rate of packets per second increases beyond the router’s or server’s capacity, the <i>faster is better </i> guideline actually turns into a disadvantage. While a traditional circuit-switched system will refuse new connections when its capacity is reached and attempt to maintain the existing connections without impairment, a VoIP server, in its race to process as many packets as possible, will not be able to handle all packets or all calls when its capacity is exceeded. This results in latency and disruptions for ongoing calls, and failed attempts of making or receiving new calls.</p><p>Without proper protection in place, the race for a superb call experience comes at a security cost which attackers learned to take advantage of.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"ddosing-voip-servers\">DDoSing VoIP servers</h2>\n      <a href=\"#ddosing-voip-servers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Attackers can take advantage of UDP and the SIP protocol to overwhelm unprotected VoIP servers with floods of specially-crafted UDP packets. One way attackers overwhelm VoIP servers is by pretending to initiate calls. Each time a malicious call initiation request is sent to the victim, their server uses computational power and memory to authenticate the request. If the attacker can generate enough call initiations, they can overwhelm the victim’s server and prevent it from processing legitimate calls. This is a classic DDoS technique applied to SIP.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/44Gt0qiZEnPizgMU0Tm4qF/398c2973aae58df7060167d794bd296e/image-3-1.png\" alt=\"Illustration of a DDoS attack preventing access to legitimate clients\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"746\" height=\"452\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>A variation on this technique is a SIP reflection attack. As with the previous technique, malicious call initiation requests are used. However, in this variation, the attacker doesn’t send the malicious traffic to the victim directly. Instead, the attacker sends them to many thousands of random unwitting SIP servers all across the Internet, and they spoof the source of the malicious traffic to be the source of the intended victim. That causes thousands of SIP servers to start sending unsolicited replies to the victim, who must then use computational resources to discern whether they are legitimate. This too can starve the victim server of resources needed to process legitimate calls, resulting in a widespread denial of service event for users. Without the proper protection in place, VoIP services can be extremely susceptible to DDoS attacks.</p><p>The graph below shows a recent multi-vector UDP DDoS attack that targeted VoIP infrastructure protected by Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/\">Magic Transit</a> service. The attack peaked just above 70 Gbps and 16M packets per second. While it&#39;s not the largest attack we’ve ever seen, attacks of this size can have large impact on unprotected infrastructure. This specific attack lasted a bit over 10 hours and was automatically detected and mitigated.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/783B5mU5tkeQh3WCy6sZZw/3646fc97616f8cdcb79a33a10383f77d/1.png\" alt=\"Graph of a 70 Gbps DDoS attack against a VoIP provider\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2048\" height=\"834\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Below are two additional graphs of similar attacks seen last week against SIP infrastructure.
