Writes are applied in strict order of their arrival in our system, and they are funneled into an asynchronous process. We update the index files by reading the old version, making changes, and writing this updated version as a new object in R2. Each index file has its own version number, and can be updated independently of the others. Between two versions of the index we may update hundreds or even thousands of IVF and metadata index files, but even as we update the files, your queries will consistently use the current version until it is time to switch.</p><p>Each IVF and metadata index file has its own version. The list of all versioned files which make up the snapshotted version of the index is contained within a <i>manifest file</i>. Each version of the index has its own manifest. When we write a new manifest file based on the previous version, we only need to update references to the index files which were modified; if there are files which weren&#39;t modified, we simply keep the references to the previous version.</p><p>We use a <i>root manifest</i> as the authority of the current version of the index. This is the pivot point for changes. The root manifest is a copy of a manifest file from a particular version, which is written to a deterministic location (the root of the R2 bucket for the index). When our async write process has finished processing vectors, and has written all new index files to R2, we <i>commit</i> by overwriting the current root manifest with a copy of the new manifest. PUT operations in R2 are atomic, so this effectively makes our updates atomic. Once the manifest is updated, Vectorize DB Service instances running on our network will pick it up, and use it to serve reads.</p><p>Because we keep past versions of index and manifest files, we effectively maintain versioned snapshots of your index. This means we have a straightforward path towards building a point-in-time recovery feature (similar to <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/reference/time-travel/\"><u>D1&#39;s Time Travel feature</u></a>).</p><p>You may have noticed that because our write process is asynchronous, this means Vectorize is <i>eventually consistent</i> — that is, there is a delay between the successful completion of a request writing on the index, and finally seeing those updates reflected in queries.  This isn&#39;t always ideal for all data storage use cases. For example, imagine two users using an online ticket reservation application for airline tickets, where both users buy the same seat — one user will successfully reserve the ticket, and the other will eventually get an error saying the seat was taken, and they need to choose again. Because a vector index is not typically used as a primary database for these transactional use cases, we decided eventual consistency was a worthy trade off in order to ensure Vectorize queries would be fast, high-throughput, and cheap even as the size of indexes grew into the millions.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"coordinating-distributed-writes-its-just-another-block-in-the-wal\">Coordinating distributed writes: it&#39;s just another block in the WAL</h2>\n            <a href=\"#coordinating-distributed-writes-its-just-another-block-in-the-wal\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>In the section above, we touched on our eventually consistent, asynchronous write process.

Vectorize’s WAL is implemented with <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/sqlite-in-durable-objects/\"><u>SQLite in Durable Objects</u></a>.</p><p>In Vectorize, the payload for each update is given an ID, written to R2, and the ID for that payload is handed to the WAL Durable Object which persists it as a &quot;block.&quot; Because it&#39;s just a pointer to the data, the blocks are lightweight records of each mutation.</p><p>Durable Objects (DO) have many benefits — strong transactional guarantees, a novel combination of compute and storage, and a high degree of horizontal scale — but individual DOs are small allotments of memory and compute. However, the process of updating the index for even a single mutation is resource intensive — a single write may include thousands of vectors, which may mean reading and writing thousands of data files stored in R2, and storing a lot of data in memory. This is more than what a single DO can handle.</p><p>So we designed the WAL to leverage DO&#39;s strengths and made it a coordinator. It controls the steps of updating the index by delegating the heavy lifting to beefier instances of compute resources (which we call &quot;Executors&quot;), but uses its transactional properties to ensure the steps are done with strong consistency. It safeguards the process from rogue or stalled executors, and ensures the WAL processing continues to move forward. DOs are easy to scale, so we create a new DO instance for each Vectorize index.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7l5hw2yVkyGKpU8xTMyX8f/743941bd273731bdb3dbf8110afc2526/unnamed.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"613\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"wal-executor\">WAL Executor</h3>\n            <a href=\"#wal-executor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The executors run from a single pool of compute resources, shared by all WALs. We use a simple producer-consumer pattern using <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/\"><u>Cloudflare Queues</u></a>. The WAL enqueues a request, and executors poll the queue. When they get a request, they call an API on the WAL requesting to be <i>assigned </i>to the request.</p><p>The WAL ensures that one and only one executor is ever assigned to that write. As the executor writes, the index files and the updated manifest are written in R2, but they are not yet visible. The final step is for the executor to call another API on the WAL to <i>commit</i> the change — and this is key — it passes along the updated manifest. The WAL is responsible for overwriting the root manifest with the updated manifest. The root manifest is the pivot point for atomic updates: once written, the change is made visible to Vectorize’s database service, and the updated data will appear in queries.</p><p>From the start, we designed this process to account for non-deterministic errors. We focused on enumerating failure modes first, and only moving forward with possible design options after asserting they handled the possibilities for failure. For example, if an executor stalls, the WAL finds a new executor. If the first executor comes back, the coordinator will reject its attempt to commit the update. Even if that first executor is working on an old version which has already been written, and writes new index files and a new manifest to R2, they will not overwrite the files written from the committed version.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"batching-updates\">Batching updates</h3>\n            <a href=\"#batching-updates\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Now that we have discussed the general flow, we can circle back to one of our favorite features of the WAL. On the executor, the most time-intensive part of the write process is reading and writing many files from R2. Even with making our reads and writes concurrent to maximize throughput, the cost of updating even thousands of vectors within a single file is dwarfed by the total latency of the network I/O. Therefore it is more efficient to maximize the number of vectors processed in a single execution.</p><p>So that is what we do: we batch discrete updates. When the WAL is ready to request work from an executor, it will get a chunk of &quot;blocks&quot; off the WAL, starting with the next un-written block, and maintaining the sequence of blocks. It will write a new &quot;batch&quot; record into the SQLite table, which ties together that sequence of blocks, the version of the index, and the ID of the executor assigned to the batch.</p><p>Users can batch multiple vectors to update in a single insert or upsert call. Because the size of each update can vary, the WAL adaptively calculates the optimal size of its batch to increase throughput. The WAL will fit as many upserted vectors as possible into a single batch by counting the number of updates represented by each block. It will batch up to 200,000 vectors at once (a value we arrived at after our own testing) with a limit of 1,000 blocks. With this throughput, we have been able to quickly load millions of vectors into an index (with upserts of 5,000 vectors at a time). Also, the WAL does not pause itself to collect more writes to batch — instead, it begins processing a write as soon as it arrives. Because the WAL only processes one batch at a time, this creates a natural pause in its workflow to batch up writes which arrive in the meantime.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"retraining-the-index\">Retraining the index</h3>\n            <a href=\"#retraining-the-index\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The WAL also coordinates our process for retraining the index. We occasionally re-train indexes to ensure the mapping of IVF centroids best reflects the current vectors in the index. This maintains the high accuracy of the vector search.</p><p>Retraining produces a completely new index. All index files are updated; vectors have been reshuffled across the index space. For this reason, all indexes have a second version stamp — which we call the <i>generation</i> — so that we can differentiate between retrained indexes. </p><p>The WAL tracks the state of the index, and controls when the training is started. We have a second pool of processes called &quot;trainers.&quot; The WAL enqueues a request on a queue, then a trainer picks up the request and it begins training.</p><p>Training can take a few minutes to complete, but we do not pause writes on the current generation. The WAL will continue to handle writes as normal. But the training runs from a fixed snapshot of the index, and will become out-of-date as the live index gets updated in parallel. Once the trainer has completed, it signals the WAL, which will then start a multi-step process to switch to the new generation. It enters a mode where it will continue to record writes in the WAL, but will stop making those writes visible on the current index. Then it will begin catching up the retrained index with all of the updates that came in since it started. Once it has caught up to all data present in the index when the trainer signaled the WAL, it will switch over to the newly retrained index. This prevents the new index from appearing to &quot;jump back in time.&quot; All subsequent writes will be applied to that new index.</p><p>This is all modeled seamlessly with the batch record. Because it associates the index version with a range of WAL blocks, multiple batches can span the same sequence of blocks as long as they belong to different generations.
