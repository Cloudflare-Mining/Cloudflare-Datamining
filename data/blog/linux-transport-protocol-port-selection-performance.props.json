We have a couple articles on the subject from this year:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"/amazon-2bn-ipv4-tax-how-avoid-paying/\">Amazon’s $2bn IPv4 tax – and how you can avoid paying it</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"/ipv6-from-dns-pov/\">Using DNS to estimate worldwide state of IPv6 adoption</a></p></li></ul><p>And many more in our <a href=\"/searchresults#q=IPv6&sort=date%20descending&f:@customer_facing_source=[Blog]&f:@language=[English]\">catalog</a>. To help with this, we spent time this last year investigating and implementing infrastructure to reduce our internal and egress use of IPv4 addresses. We prefer to re-allocate our addresses than to purchase more due to increasing costs. And in this effort we discovered that our cache service is one of our bigger consumers of IPv4 addresses. Before we remove IPv4 addresses for our cache services, we first need to understand how cache works at Cloudflare.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"how-does-cache-work-at-cloudflare\">How does cache work at Cloudflare?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#how-does-cache-work-at-cloudflare\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Describing the full scope of the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/cdn-reference-architecture/#cloudflare-cdn-architecture-and-design\">architecture</a> is out of scope of this article, however, we can provide a basic outline:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/70ULgxsqU4zuyWYVrNn6et/f80bedc31733a7d09e120bb797c055ca/image1-2.png\" alt=\"Figure 1: Diagram representing requests coming from an Internet User, protected by Cloudflare products including WAF and DDoS protection, and traveling through the Anycast Network to reach the origin server using Smart Tiered Cache.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"859\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><ol><li><p>Internet User makes a request to pull an asset</p></li><li><p>Cloudflare infrastructure routes that request to a handler</p></li><li><p>Handler machine returns cached asset, or if miss</p></li><li><p>Handler machine reaches to origin server (owned by a customer) to pull the requested asset</p></li></ol><p>The particularly interesting part is the cache miss case.

Checkout this in-depth <a href=\"https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html\">guide</a> about flame graphs for more details.</p><p>Most of the samples are taken in the function <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6/source/net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c#L1000\"><code>__inet_hash_connect()</code></a>. We can see that there are also many samples for <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6/source/net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c#L544\"><code>__inet_check_established()</code></a> with some lock contention sampled between. We have a better picture of a potential bottleneck, but we do not have a consistent test to compare against.</p><p>Wrk introduces a bit more variability than we would like to see. Still focusing on the function <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6/source/net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c#L201\"><code>tcp_v4_connect()</code></a>, we performed another synthetic test with a homegrown benchmark tool to test one IPv4 address. A tool such as <a href=\"https://github.com/ColinIanKing/stress-ng\">stress-ng</a> may also be used, but some modification is necessary to implement the socket option <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ip.7.html\"><code>IP_LOCAL_PORT_RANGE</code></a>. There is more about that socket option later.</p><p>We are now going to ensure a deterministic amount of connections, and remove lock contention from the problem.

We know from the flame graph and the function <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6/source/net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c#L1000\"><code>__inet_hash_connect()</code></a> that this holds the algorithm for port selection. For context, this function is responsible for associating the socket to a source port in a late bind. If a port was previously provided with bind(), the algorithm just tests for a unique TCP 4-tuple (src ip, src port, dest ip, dest port) and ignores port selection.</p><p>Before we dive in, there is a little bit of setup work that happens first. Linux first generates a time-based hash that is used as the basis for the starting port, then adds randomization, and then puts that information into an offset variable. This is always set to an even integer.</p><p><a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6/source/net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c#L1043\">net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c</a></p>\n            <pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\">   offset &amp;= ~1U;\n    \nother_parity_scan:\n    port = low + offset;\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; remaining; i += 2, port += 2) {\n        if (unlikely(port &gt;= high))\n            port -= remaining;\n\n        inet_bind_bucket_for_each(tb, &amp;head-&gt;chain) {\n            if (inet_bind_bucket_match(tb, net, port, l3mdev)) {\n                if (!check_established(death_row, sk, port, &amp;tw))\n                    goto ok;\n                goto next_port;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    offset++;\n    if ((offset &amp; 1) &amp;&amp; remaining &gt; 1)\n        goto other_parity_scan;</pre></code>\n            <p>Then in a nutshell: loop through one half of ports in our range (all even or all odd ports) before looping through the other half of ports (all odd or all even ports respectively) for each connection. Specifically, this is a variation of the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6056#section-3.3.4\">Double-Hash Port Selection Algorithm</a>. We will ignore the bind bucket functionality since that is not our main concern.</p><p>Depending on your port range, you either start with an even port or an odd port. In our case, our low port, 9024, is even. Then the port is picked by adding the offset to the low port:</p><p><a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6/source/net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c#L1045\">net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c</a></p>\n            <pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\">port = low + offset;</pre></code>\n            <p>If low was odd, we will have an odd starting port because odd + even = odd.</p><p>There is a bit too much going on in the loop to explain in text. I have an example instead:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6uVqtAUR07epRRKqQbHWkp/0e204a4f19b381ae1dce5c5ac4094891/image5.png\" alt=\"Figure 6: A step-by-step diagram showing how the function __inet_has_connect() finds a port for connections preferring late port-binding.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"825\" height=\"471\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This example is bound by 8 ports and 8 possible connections. All ports start unused. As a port is used up, the port is grayed out. Green boxes represent the next chosen port. All other colors represent open ports. Blue arrows are even port iterations of offset, and red are the odd port iterations of offset. Note that the offset is randomly picked, and once we cross over to the odd range, the offset is incremented by one.</p><p>For each selection of a port, the algorithm then makes a call to the function <code>check_established()</code> which dereferences <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6/source/net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c#L544\"><code>__inet_check_established()</code></a>. This function loops over sockets to verify that the TCP 4-tuple is unique. The takeaway is that the socket list in the function is usually smaller than not. This grows as more unique TCP 4-tuples are introduced to the system. Longer socket lists may slow down port selection eventually. We have a blog post on <a href=\"/how-to-stop-running-out-of-ephemeral-ports-and-start-to-love-long-lived-connections/\">ephemeral port exhausting</a> that dives into the socket list and port uniqueness criteria.</p><p>At this point, we can summarize that the odd/even port split is what is causing our performance bottleneck. And during the investigation, it was not obvious to me (or even maybe you) why the offset was initially calculated the way it was, and why the odd/even port split was introduced. After some git-archaeology the decisions become more clear.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"security-considerations\">Security considerations</h3>\n            <a href=\"#security-considerations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Port selection has been shown to be used in device <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/910435/\">fingerprinting</a> in the past.

Similar to TCP, the algorithm will loop over the whole port range space incrementally. This is only the case if the port is not already supplied in the bind() call. The key difference between UDP and TCP is that a random number is generated as a step variable. Then, once a first port is identified, the algorithm loops on that port with the random number. This relies on an uint16_t overflow to eventually loop back to the chosen port. If all ports are used, increment the port by one and repeat. There is no port splitting between even and odd ports.</p><p>The best comparison to the TCP measurements is a UDP setup similar to:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\">sk = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)\nsk.bind((src_ip, 0))\nsk.connect((dest_ip, dest_port))</pre></code>\n            <p>And the results should be unsurprising with one IPv4 source address:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4UM5d0RBTgqADgVLbbqMlQ/235ac3ee5183efdefb42f9bd17dee9a3/Screenshot-2024-02-07-at-16.06.27.png\" alt=\"Figure 9: A detailed chart representing a flat-linear distribution of port-finding speeds. Out of 56,512 connections the average time spent finding an even port is 0.001 milliseconds while we see 0.001 milliseconds on average for odd ports. There are no errors.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1614\" height=\"902\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>UDP fundamentally behaves differently from TCP. And there is less work overall for port lookups. The outliers in the chart represent a worst-case scenario when we reach a fairly bad random number collision. In that case, we need to more-completely loop over the ephemeral range to find a port.</p><p>UDP has another problem. Given the socket option <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, the port you get back may conflict with another UDP socket. This is in part due to the function <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6/source/net/ipv4/udp.c#L141\"><code>udp_lib_lport_inuse()</code></a> ignoring the UDP 2-tuple (src ip, src port) check given the socket option. When this happens you may have a new socket that overwrites a previous. Extra care is needed in that case. We wrote more in depth about these cases in a previous <a href=\"/how-to-stop-running-out-of-ephemeral-ports-and-start-to-love-long-lived-connections/\">blog post</a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"in-summary\">In summary</h2>\n            <a href=\"#in-summary\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare can make a lot of unicast egress connections to origin servers with popular uncached assets. To avoid port-resource exhaustion, we balance the load over a couple of IPv4 source addresses during those peak times. Then we asked: “what is the performance impact of one IPv4 source address for our connect()-heavy workloads?”. Port selection is not only difficult to get right, but is also a performance bottleneck. This is evidenced by measuring connect() latency with a flame graph and synthetic workloads. That then led us to discovering TCP’s quirky port selection process that loops over half your ephemeral ports before the other for each connect().</p><p>We then proposed three solutions to solve the problem outside of adding more IP addresses or other architectural changes: “<a href=\"#selecttestrepeat\">select, test, repeat</a>”, “<a href=\"#random\">select port by random shifting range</a>”, and an <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ip.7.html\"><code>IP_LOCAL_PORT_RANGE</code></a> socket option <a href=\"#kernel\">solution</a> in newer kernels. And finally closed out with other protocol honorable mentions and their quirks.</p><p>Do not take our numbers! Please explore and measure your own systems. With a better understanding of your workloads, you can make a good decision on which strategy works best for your needs. Even better if you come up with your own strategy!</p>",
