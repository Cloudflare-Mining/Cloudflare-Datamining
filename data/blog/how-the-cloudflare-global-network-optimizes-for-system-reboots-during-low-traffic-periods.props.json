To enable this, we have mechanisms for the whole fleet to automatically reboot with changes gated on a unique identifier for the reboot cycle. Each data center has a <b>maintenance window</b>, which is a time period - usually a couple of hours - during which reboots are permitted.</p><p>We take our customer experience very seriously, and hence we have several mechanisms to ensure that disruption to customer traffic does not occur. One example is <a href=\"/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/\">Unimog</a>, our in-house load balancer that spreads load across the servers in a data center, ensuring that there is no disruption when a server is taken out for routine maintenance.</p><p>The SRE team decided to further reduce risk by only allowing reboots in a data center when the customer traffic is at the lowest. We also needed to automate the existing manual process for determining the window - eliminating toil.</p><p>In this post, we’ll discuss how the team improved this manual process and automated the determination of these windows using a trigonometric function - sinusoidal wave fitting.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"when-is-the-best-time-to-reboot\">When is the best time to reboot?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#when-is-the-best-time-to-reboot\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Thanks to <a href=\"/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/\">how efficient our load-balancing framework is</a> within a data center, technically we could proceed to schedule reboots throughout the day with zero impact to traffic flowing through the data center.

These are described below;</p><p><b>Amplitude</b>: This is the distance from the peak/valley to the time axis, and is approximated as the standard deviation multiplied by √2. The standard deviation represents the variability in the data points, and for a sine wave that varies between -1 and +1, the standard deviation is approximately 0.707 (or 1/√2). Therefore, by multiplying the standard deviation of the data by √2, we can represent an approximation of the amplitude.</p><p><b>Frequency</b>: This is the number of cycles (time periods) in one second. We are concerned with the daily CPU pattern, meaning that the guess should be one full wave every 24 hours (i.e. 1/86400).</p><p><b>Phase</b>: This is the position of the wave at T=0. No guess is needed for this.</p><p><b>Offset</b>: To fit the sine wave on the CPU values, we need to shift upwards by the offset. This offset is the mean of the CPU values.</p><p>Here’s a basic example of how it can be implemented in Python:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\">timestamps = numpy.array(timestamps)\ncpu = numpy.array(cpu)\nguess_freq = 1 / 86400  # 24h periodicity\nguess_amp = numpy.std(cpu) * 2.0**0.5\nguess_offset = numpy.mean(cpu)\nguess = numpy.array([guess_amp, 2.0 * numpy.pi * guess_freq, 0.0, guess_offset])\n \ndef sinfunc(timestamps, amplitude, frequency, phase, offset):\n    return amplitude * numpy.sin(frequency * timestamps + phase) + offset\n \namplitude, frequency, phase, offset, _ = scipy.optimize.curve_fit(\n    sinfunc, timestamps, cpu, p0=guess, maxfev=2000\n)</pre></code>\n            \n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"applying-the-theory\">Applying the theory</h2>\n            <a href=\"#applying-the-theory\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>With the theory understood, we implemented this logic in our reboot system.

To achieve this we store the information in a Consul KV, along with a session lock that expires after the validity period.

There are several options but the most efficient was to implement a pre-fetch of this window on startup of the reboot system.</p><p><b>Observability</b>: We exported a couple of metrics to Prometheus, which help us understand the decisions being made and any errors we need to address.
