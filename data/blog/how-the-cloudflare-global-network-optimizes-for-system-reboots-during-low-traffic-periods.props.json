To enable this, we have mechanisms for the whole fleet to automatically reboot with changes gated on a unique identifier for the reboot cycle. Each data center has a <b>maintenance window</b>, which is a time period - usually a couple of hours - during which reboots are permitted.</p><p>We take our customer experience very seriously, and hence we have several mechanisms to ensure that disruption to customer traffic does not occur. One example is <a href=\"/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/\">Unimog</a>, our in-house load balancer that spreads load across the servers in a data center, ensuring that there is no disruption when a server is taken out for routine maintenance.</p><p>The SRE team decided to further reduce risk by only allowing reboots in a data center when the customer traffic is at the lowest. We also needed to automate the existing manual process for determining the window - eliminating toil.</p><p>In this post, we’ll discuss how the team improved this manual process and automated the determination of these windows using a trigonometric function - sinusoidal wave fitting.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"when-is-the-best-time-to-reboot\">When is the best time to reboot?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#when-is-the-best-time-to-reboot\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Thanks to <a href=\"/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/\">how efficient our load-balancing framework is</a> within a data center, technically we could proceed to schedule reboots throughout the day with zero impact to traffic flowing through the data center. However, operationally the management is simplified by requiring reboots take place between certain times for each data center. It both acts as a rate-limiter to avoid rebooting all servers in our larger data centers in a single day, and makes remediating any unforeseen issues that arise during the reboots more straightforward, as issues can be caught within the first batch of reboots.</p><p>One of the first steps is to determine the time window during which we are going to allow these reboots to take place; choosing the relative low-traffic period for a data center makes the most sense for obvious reasons.

These are described below;</p><p><b>Amplitude</b>: This is the distance from the peak/valley to the time axis, and is approximated as the standard deviation multiplied by √2. The standard deviation represents the variability in the data points, and for a sine wave that varies between -1 and +1, the standard deviation is approximately 0.707 (or 1/√2). Therefore, by multiplying the standard deviation of the data by √2, we can represent an approximation of the amplitude.</p><p><b>Frequency</b>: This is the number of cycles (time periods) in one second. We are concerned with the daily CPU pattern, meaning that the guess should be one full wave every 24 hours (i.e. 1/86400).</p><p><b>Phase</b>: This is the position of the wave at T=0. No guess is needed for this.</p><p><b>Offset</b>: To fit the sine wave on the CPU values, we need to shift upwards by the offset. This offset is the mean of the CPU values.</p><p>Here’s a basic example of how it can be implemented in Python:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\">timestamps = numpy.array(timestamps)\ncpu = numpy.array(cpu)\nguess_freq = 1 / 86400  # 24h periodicity\nguess_amp = numpy.std(cpu) * 2.0**0.5\nguess_offset = numpy.mean(cpu)\nguess = numpy.array([guess_amp, 2.0 * numpy.pi * guess_freq, 0.0, guess_offset])\n \ndef sinfunc(timestamps, amplitude, frequency, phase, offset):\n    return amplitude * numpy.sin(frequency * timestamps + phase) + offset\n \namplitude, frequency, phase, offset, _ = scipy.optimize.curve_fit(\n    sinfunc, timestamps, cpu, p0=guess, maxfev=2000\n)</pre></code>\n            \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"applying-the-theory\">Applying the theory</h2>\n      <a href=\"#applying-the-theory\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>With the theory understood, we implemented this logic in our reboot system. To determine the window, the reboot system queries <a href=\"/tag/prometheus/\">Prometheus</a> for the data center CPU over a configurable period and attempts to fit a curve on the resultant pattern.</p><p>If there’s an accurate enough fit, the window is cached in Consul along with other metadata. Otherwise, fallback logic is implemented. For various reasons, some data centers might not have enough data for a fit at that moment. For example, a data center which was only recently provisioned and hasn’t served enough traffic yet.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5CrPBsJwkVqmvL4NYkcTsK/35b0bbf59fce37c7fe0efc461e1f562f/Frame-5269.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"445\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When a server requests to reboot, the system checks if the current time is within the maintenance window first, before running other pre-flight checks. In most cases the window already exists because of the prefetch mechanism implemented, but when it doesn’t due to Consul session expiry or some other reason, it is computed using the CPU data in Prometheus.</p><p>The considerations in this phase were:</p><p><b>Caching</b>: Calculation of the window should only be done over a pre-decided validity period. To achieve this we store the information in a Consul KV, along with a session lock that expires after the validity period. We <a href=\"/how-we-use-hashicorp-nomad/\">have mentioned in the past</a> that we use Consul as a service-discovery and key-value storage mechanism. This is an example of the latter.</p><p><b>Pre-fetch</b>: In practice, it makes sense to control when this computation happens. There are several options but the most efficient was to implement a pre-fetch of this window on startup of the reboot system.</p><p><b>Observability</b>: We exported a couple of metrics to Prometheus, which help us understand the decisions being made and any errors we need to address. We also export the maintenance window itself for consumption by other automated systems and teams.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-accurate-is-this-fit\">How accurate is this fit?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-accurate-is-this-fit\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Most load patterns fit into the sine wave, but there are some edge cases occasionally. e.g. a smaller data center that has a constant CPU.

In this theory, the closer the chi-square value to the length of the sample, the better the fit is. Chi-squared values that are a lot smaller than the length represent an overestimated uncertainty and much larger represent a bad fit.</p><p>This is implemented with a simple formula:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\">def goodness_of_fit(observed, expected):\n \n    chisq = numpy.sum(((observed - expected)/ numpy.std(observed)) ** 2)\n \n    # Present the chisq value percentage relative to the sample length\n    n = len(observed)\n    return ((n - chisq) / n) * 100</pre></code>\n            <p>The observed result of this is that the smaller the chi-squared, the more accurate the fit and vice versa.
