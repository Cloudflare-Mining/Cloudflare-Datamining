The answer lies in our globally interconnected network.</p><p>Cloudflare is one of the most interconnected networks in the world, peering with over 9,500 networks globally, including major ISPs, cloud providers, and enterprises. We currently interconnect with Azure through private or public peering across all major regions — including private interconnections at key locations (see below).</p><p>Private Network Interconnects typically occur within the same facility through a fiber optic cable between routers for the two networks; peered connections occur at Internet exchanges offering high performance and availability. We are actively working on expanding on this interconnectivity between Azure and Cloudflare for our customers.</p><p>In addition to the private interconnections, we also have <b>five Internet exchanges with private peering, and over 108 public peering links with Azure</b></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/Oy7Sz83gx7Yk2YPIEjPe7/207e74571721c887c171caa825db89bb/image2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1610\" height=\"1085\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Wondering what this really means? Let’s look at an example. Say an Internet visitor is in Sydney and requests content from an origin that&#39;s hosted in an Azure location in Chicago. When the visitor makes a request, Cloudflare automatically carries it to the Cloudflare data center in Sydney. The traffic is then routed over Cloudflare’s network all the way to Chicago where the origin is hosted on Azure. The request is then handed over to an Azure data center <b>over our private interconnections.</b></p><p>On the way back (egress path), the request is handed over from Azure network to Cloudflare at the origin in Chicago via our private interconnection (without involving any ISP). Then it’s carried entirely over the Cloudflare network to Sydney and back to the visitor.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3UAKwOR1Nf5Iql6fuxlIzy/fe1431e1482125175f334647f76820bd/image4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1492\" height=\"399\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"why-does-the-internet-need-this\">Why does the Internet need this?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#why-does-the-internet-need-this\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Customer choice.

Enabling Routing Preference on the Azure dashboard was quick and easy. It was a one-and-done effort and we get discounted Egress rates on every Azure bill.”</i>- <i>Darin MacRae, Chief Architect / Cloud Computing, MyRadar.com</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&quot;Along with Cloudflare&#39;s excellent security features and high performing CDN, the data transfer rates from Azure&#39;s Routing Preference enabled by Cloudflare make the offer very compelling. Enabling and receiving the discount was very easy and helped us optimize our investment without any effort.”</i>- <i>Arthur Roodenburg, CIO, Act-3D B.V.</i></p></blockquote><p>We’re pleased today to offer this benefit to all Cloudflare customers.
