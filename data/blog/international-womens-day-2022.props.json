It’s important to us to include other ERGs in these conversations since the goal of empowerment, representation, and support is shared among us and can’t be done alone. And we want to play closer attention to the layers that form a person’s social identity, creating compounding experiences of discrimination. “All inequality is not created equal,” <a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/6/explainer-intersectional-feminism-what-it-means-and-why-it-matters\">says</a> Kimberlé Crenshaw, the law professor who coined “intersectional feminism” term in 1989.

An ally is someone who recognizes unearned privileges in their lives and takes responsibility to end patterns of injustice. At Cloudflare, we’re working hard to build more diverse and equitable teams, as well as create and maintain an environment that is inclusive and welcoming. There are many actions you can take as an ally; some include:</p><ul><li><p><b>Educating yourself:</b> listen to the experiences of your women colleagues and work with them to understand their perspectives.</p></li><li><p><b>Amplifying women’s opinions and advocating for them:</b> speak up for others and champion them when they need support and encouragement.</p></li><li><p><b>Taking action in the workplace:</b> if you see inequality or discrimination happening, reach out to discuss further and understand what can be done.</p></li><li><p><b>Advocating for diversity:</b> talk with your peers and leaders about the ways you can get involved with improving diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p></li></ul><p>Celebrate International Women’s Day and Women’s Empowerment Month in your own creative ways! And all throughout the year, remember to empower women and to recognize them in such a way that their work is no longer anonymous.
