More voters than ever are going to the polls in at least 60 countries for national elections, plus the 27 member states of the European Union. This includes eight of the world’s 10 most populous nations, impacting around half of the world’s population.</p><p>To track and analyze these significant global events, we’ve created the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/elections-2024\">2024 Election Insights</a> report on Cloudflare Radar, which will be regularly updated as elections take place.</p><p>Our data shows that during elections, there is often a decrease in Internet traffic during polling hours, followed by an increase as results are announced. This trend has been observed before in countries like <a href=\"/elections-france-2022/\">France</a> and <a href=\"/how-the-brazilian-presidential-elections-affected-internet-traffic/\">Brazil</a>, and more recently in Mexico and India — where elections were held between April 19 and June 1 in seven phases. Some regions, like <a href=\"https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1748326986936635764\">Comoros</a> and <a href=\"/q1-2024-internet-disruption-summary#governmentdirected\">Pakistan</a>, have experienced government-directed Internet disruptions around election time.</p><p>Below, you’ll find a review of the trends we saw in elections in South Africa (May 29), to Mexico (June 2), India (April 19 - June 1) and Iceland (June 1). This includes election-related shifts in traffic, as well at attacks. For example, during the <a href=\"/eu-elections-2024\">European Parliament election</a> (June 6-9, 2024), <a href=\"/dutch-political-websites-hit-by-cyber-attacks-as-eu-voting-starts\">DDoS attacks targeted Dutch political websites</a> for two days, peaking at 73,000 requests per second.</p><p>We’ll also be keeping an eye on upcoming elections. The United Kingdom recently scheduled its general election for July 4, making it the latest addition to the electoral calendar.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6q0UiHJhHz8WwHFW3w1Jf5/daccfa205b9d58681247ff5a1cb6ffc0/image4-2.png\" alt=\"Locations with national elections in 2024 (over 60, plus EU elections with 27 countries participating).
