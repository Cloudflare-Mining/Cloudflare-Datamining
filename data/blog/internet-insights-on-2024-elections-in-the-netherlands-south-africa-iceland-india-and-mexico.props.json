More voters than ever are going to the polls in at least 60 countries for national elections, plus the 27 member states of the European Union. This includes eight of the world’s 10 most populous nations, impacting around half of the world’s population.</p><p>To track and analyze these significant global events, we’ve created the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/elections-2024\">2024 Election Insights</a> report on Cloudflare Radar, which will be regularly updated as elections take place.</p><p>Our data shows that during elections, there is often a decrease in Internet traffic during polling hours, followed by an increase as results are announced. This trend has been observed before in countries like <a href=\"/elections-france-2022/\">France</a> and <a href=\"/how-the-brazilian-presidential-elections-affected-internet-traffic/\">Brazil</a>, and more recently in Mexico and India — where elections were held between April 19 and June 1 in seven phases.

One notable case was the 466% surge in DDoS attacks on Sweden after its acceptance into the NATO alliance, mirroring the pattern observed during Finland’s NATO accession in 2023.</p><p>Real-world conflicts and wars often lead to Internet pattern changes, disruptions, or cyberattacks. For instance, during the first year of the <a href=\"/one-year-of-war-in-ukraine\">war in Ukraine</a>, and more recently, Cloudflare’s <a href=\"/disrupting-flyingyeti-campaign-targeting-ukraine/\">Cloudforce One</a> thwarted a phishing attack by the Russia-aligned threat actor FlyingYeti. Our recent <a href=\"/galileo10anniversaryradardashboard\">Project Galileo blog post</a> also details how we protected Meduza, an independent news outlet focused on Russia, from online attacks in late 2023.</p><p>We’ve also reported (<a href=\"/internet-traffic-patterns-in-israel-and-palestine-following-the-october-2023-attacks\">1</a>, <a href=\"/cyber-attacks-in-the-israel-hamas-war\">2</a>) on Internet changes, disruptions, and increased cyberattacks following the start of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7, 2023.If you want to follow more trends and insights about the Internet and elections in particular, you can check <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center\">Cloudflare Radar</a>, and more specifically our new <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/elections-2024\"><i>2024 Elections Insights</i></a> report, that we’re updating as national and European elections take place throughout the year.</p>",
