Luckily for everyone, finding a hash collision is <i>not</i> enough to forge a digital certificate and break the trust model of the Internet.</p><p>We’ll explore how hash collisions have been used to forge digital signatures in the past.

Whether it’s logging in to your bank or reading Reddit, HTTPS protects you by encrypting the data you exchange with a site and authenticating the site&#39;s identity with a digital certificate. Browsers visually display the added security of HTTPS as a padlock in the address bar.</p><p>HTTPS can prove a site’s authenticity to a browser when a site owns a digital certificate that asserts the owner’s identity and hostname. Certificates are small files digitally signed by trusted third parties known as Certificate Authorities (CAs). For browsers, digital signatures are the definitive source of trust. If your browser trusts the CA and the digital signature on the certificate is correct, then the browser trusts the certificate. This system of identity is known as the public key infrastructure (PKI), something we’ve covered <a href=\"/how-to-build-your-own-public-key-infrastructure/\">in detail in a previous post</a>.</p><p>This system falls apart if digital signatures can no longer be trusted. If someone can create a certificate for cloudflare.com with a signature from a trusted CA, they can use it to impersonate the cloudflare.com website to visitors (given they can <a href=\"/dnssec-an-introduction\">modify DNS</a>).</p><p>A digital signature is a number cryptographically tied to a message with public key. Every digital signature requires a public-private key pair and a hash function. The hash function is used to take the message and replace it with a unique digest, the private key is used to sign, and the public key to verify signatures.</p><p>For example, to create an RSA signature, you take a hash of the message and encrypt that hash with your private key. Anyone can verify that signature both belongs to you and is valid for the associated message. Take the public key, decrypt the hash and compare it with the hash of the message. If it&#39;s a match, the signature is correct. <a href=\"/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/\">ECDSA</a> is a more recent algorithm that gets the same job done.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/DECDGDpoEwCG0eHS4QmLn/8df3a6e7d0f0a4ddf9c8351e94f27b08/rsa-signing-1.png\" alt=\"digital signatures\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"720\" height=\"372\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>There are several ways of obtaining a digitally signed certificate for a website. The standard way is by purchasing a certificate from a certificate authority like GlobalSign or Comodo. CAs follow a set of rules about certificate issuance, governed by CA/Browser Forum’s <a href=\"https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements/\">Baseline Requirements</a>.</p><p>Another way to get a certificate is to steal a CA’s private key. In addition to being potentially illegal, it is also very hard to do: CA private keys are usually kept in dedicated secure machines called Hardware Security Modules (HSM) designed to protect against key extraction.</p><p>A third more interesting way to obtain a certificate is to create a certificate that has the same hash as an existing trusted certificate. The signature from the trusted certificate can be added to the untrusted certificate, making it appear trusted.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6v5ZRqGjgWN7MI75yf6SBP/09d2a0d7103d40ae775cf46e2157fd31/rsa-signing-2.png\" alt=\"hash collision\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"720\" height=\"217\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>If you can find a message that has the same hash value as a signed message, then you can swap in your message and the signature will verify correctly.

In the original MD5 collision attack, the researchers computed two messages <code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code> such that <code>H(M1) = H(M2)</code>. Stevens extended this research to find a way to make two known values <code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code> collide by appending bytes. With prefixes <code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code>, he was able to demonstrate how to find S1 and S2 so that <code>H(P1|S1) = H(P2|S2)</code>.</p><p>This was enough to allow an attacker to create two certificates with the same hash. Let’s look at the approximate structure of a certificate:</p><ul><li><p>Serial number</p></li><li><p>Validity period</p></li><li><p>Domain name</p></li><li><p>Public key</p></li><li><p>X.509 extensions</p></li><li><p>Signature</p></li></ul><p>If the attacker knows every value before the domain, then they can take</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">P1 = Serial number | Validity period | real domain name</pre></code>\n            <p>and</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">P2 = Serial number | Validity period | forged domain name</pre></code>\n            <p>and apply the attack to get S1 and S2 that fit into the public key section. If the serial number and validity period can be predicted, a collision can be found using the following steps:</p><ol><li><p>Guess when the certificate will be issued;</p></li><li><p>Predict the serial number for certificates issued in that time period; and</p></li><li><p>Compute matching prefixes for several guesses covering the expected serial numbers and issuance dates</p></li></ol>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/79PwdrVZnzNpdV3JWdnUdw/c4407fb3b97a6384778d10df999ea8d7/sha-1-certificate-forgery-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"488\" height=\"309\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The attacker precomputes chosen-prefix collisions for the choices for each of these values, where one prefix has a domain name that is under the requester’s control (e.g. for attacker.com) and one for the target domain (e.g. google.com). The &quot;collision bits&quot; that cause the two certificates to collide end up aligning with first few bytes of the public key of the certificate.</p><p>Once the collisions are computed, the attacker has to convince a CA to issue a certificate with the correct serial number at the correct time for a verifiable domain and a public key that corresponds to the collision bits. If they&#39;re lucky, the certificate the CA returns will have the same hash as the malicious certificate. They can then transpose the valid signature onto the malicious certificate to make it trusted.</p><p>Colliding the domain name is the simplest type of chosen-prefix collision attack. It is also possible to prepare the collision in such a way that the RSA public key from the trusted certificate lines up with the X.509 extensions of the forged certificate.

The National Security Agency published SHA-1 (SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm) in 1995 as a standard for cryptographically secure hashing. Designed to be collision resistant up to 2<sup>80</sup> bits, SHA-1 has had a long and useful life, and a collision has not been published as of this blog post. Even though a collision has never been published, several theoretical attacks (the <a href=\"http://gauss.ececs.uc.edu/Courses/c653/lectures/Hashing/sha1-crypto-auth-new-2-yao.pdf\">first in 2005</a>, improved <a href=\"http://2012.sharcs.org/slides/stevens.pdf\">in 2012</a>) indicate that SHA-1 is not as secure as its bit length implies. The latest research suggests that its collision resistance is <a href=\"https://marc-stevens.nl/research/papers/PhD%20Thesis%20Marc%20Stevens%20-%20Attacks%20on%20Hash%20Functions%20and%20Applications.pdf\">at best 265</a> — within the realm of feasibility for some governments. In fact, researchers published a freestart collision (a precursor to a full collision) for SHA-1 <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/967.pdf\">earlier this year</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/dR7YVWkazh7VY1IGSz8tb/e171383cbc753cb8fefcbf911b525eb3/Sharks_outside_cage.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_proof_cage#/media/File:Sharks_outside_cage.jpg\">CC BY-SA 2.0</a></p><p>Academic cryptanalysts are like sharks.

Requiring CAs to make the serial number unpredictable instead of sequential, it is possible to make the chosen-prefix attack significantly more expensive.</p><p>For example, if a CA ensures the serial number contains 20 bits of entropy, then the attacker will need to compute 220 chosen-prefixes in order to guess the serial number correctly.</p><p>This makes the attack over a <i>million times</i> more difficult.</p><p>Computing a SHA-1 collision might be feasible in 2016, and there&#39;s a chance that chosen-prefix attacks also become feasible. Nevertheless, choosing partially randomized serial can make certificate forgery significantly more difficult for attackers.

Some browsers even show security warnings when websites use certificates signed using a SHA-1 based digital signature. A hash collision in SHA-1 is bad, but it’s not what matters for web security. Digital signature forgery is more problematic for trust on the Web. Requiring CAs to randomize serial numbers will significantly increase the cost of such forgeries, allowing potentially weak algorithms like SHA-1 to be useful for longer. This is why we make it <b>mandatory</b> for CAs to use serial numbers that include at least 20 bits of entropy in our proposal to the CA/B Forum <a href=\"https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/2015-December/006488.html\">for Legacy Verified (LV) SHA-1 certificates</a>.</p>",
