	<p>On October 13, 2025, security researchers from <a href="https://fearsoff.org"><u>FearsOff</u></a> identified and reported a vulnerability in Cloudflare's ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) validation logic that disabled some of the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf"><u>WAF</u></a> features on specific ACME-related paths. The vulnerability was reported and validated through Cloudflare’s <a href="https://hackerone.com/cloudflare?type=team"><u>bug bounty</u></a> program.</p>
	<p>The vulnerability was rooted in how our edge network processed requests destined for the ACME HTTP-01 challenge path (<code><i>/.well-known/acme-challenge/*</i></code>). </p>
	<p>Here, we’ll briefly explain how this protocol works and the action we took to address the vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>Cloudflare has patched this vulnerability and there is no action necessary for Cloudflare customers.</b> There is no evidence of any malicious actor abusing this vulnerability.</p>

	<p>ACME is a protocol used to automate the issuance, renewal, and revocation of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate"><u>SSL/TLS certificates</u></a>. When an HTTP-01 challenge is used to validate domain ownership, a Certificate Authority (CA) will expect to find a validation token at the HTTP path following the format of <i>http://{customer domain}/.well-known/acme-challenge/{token value}</i>.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If this challenge is used by a certificate order managed by Cloudflare, then Cloudflare will respond on this path and provide the token provided by the CA to the caller. If the token provided does not correlate to a Cloudflare managed order, then this request would be passed on to the customer origin, since they may be attempting to complete domain validation as a part of some other system. Check out the flow below for more details — other use cases are discussed later in the blog post.</p>

	<p>Certain requests to<i> /.well-known/acme-challenge/*</i> would cause the logic serving ACME challenge tokens to disable WAF features on a challenge request, and allow the challenge request to continue to the origin when it should have been blocked.</p>
	<p>Previously, when Cloudflare was serving a HTTP-01 challenge token, if the path requested by the caller matched a token for an active challenge in our system, the logic serving an ACME challenge token would disable WAF features, since Cloudflare would be directly serving the response. This is done because those features can interfere with the CA’s ability to validate the token values and would cause failures with automated certificate orders and renewals.</p>
	<p>However, in the scenario that the token used was associated with a different zone and not directly managed by Cloudflare, the request would be allowed to proceed onto the customer origin without further processing by WAF rulesets.</p>

	<p>To mitigate this issue, a code change was released. This code change only allows the set of security features to be disabled in the event that the request matches a valid ACME HTTP-01 challenge token for the hostname. In that case, Cloudflare has a challenge response to serve back.</p>
