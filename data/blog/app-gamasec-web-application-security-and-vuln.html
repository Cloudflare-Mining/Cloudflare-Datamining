	<p>We enjoy working with companies who share a focus on website security. When <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/gamasec" target="_blank">GamaSec</a>, an online web vulnerability-assessment service, inquired about ways to integrate, we were excited to make their scanning service available as a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps" target="_blank">CloudFlare app</a>, where any CloudFlare customer can easily turn on GamaSec.</p>
	<p>GamaSec's cloud-based security scan serves as an early-warning system of defense for web operation, applications, and online information. GamaSec can be used by any website of any size and is now available to all CloudFlare customers: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/gamasec" target="_blank">https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/gamasec</a></p>
	<h3 id="vulnerabilityscanning">Vulnerability Scanning</h3>
	<p>GamaSec goes beyond signature-based tools to find more "real" vulnerabilities.</p>
	<p>The GamaSec Application Vulnerability Scanner identifies application vulnerabilities such as Cross Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and Code Inclusion, as well as site exposure risks. It also ranks threat priority, produces highly graphical, intuitive HTML reports, and indicates site security posture by vulnerabilities and threat exposure.</p>
