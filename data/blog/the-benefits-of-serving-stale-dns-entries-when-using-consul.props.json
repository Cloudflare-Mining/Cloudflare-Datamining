This cluster exposes HTTP and DNS interfaces so that clients can query the Consul catalog and search for a particular service and the majority of the clients use DNS. We were aware from the start that the DNS query latencies were not great from certain parts of the world that were furthest away from these data centers. This, together with the fact that we use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS\">DNS over TLS</a>, results in some long latencies. The TTL of these names being low makes it even more impractical when resolving these names in the hot path.</p><p>The usual way to solve these issues is by caching values so that at least subsequent requests are resolved quickly, and this is exactly what our resolver of choice, <a href=\"https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/\">Unbound</a>, is configured to do. The problem remains when the cache expires. When it expires, the next client will have to wait while Unbound resolves the name using the network. To have a low recovery time in case some service needs to failover and clients need to use another address we use a small TTL (30 seconds) in our records and as such cache expirations happen often.</p><p>There are at least two strategies to deal with this: prefetching and stale cache.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"prefetching\">Prefetching</h2>\n            <a href=\"#prefetching\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>When prefetching is turned on, the server tries to refresh DNS records in the background before they expire. In practice, the way this works is: if an entry is served from cache and the TTL is less than 10% of the lifetime of the records, the server responds to the client, but in the background, it dispatches a job to refresh the record across the network. If it all goes as planned, the entry is refreshed in the cache before the TTL expires, and no client is ever left waiting for the network resolution.</p><p>This works very well for records that are accessed frequently, but poses issues in two situations: records that are accessed infrequently and records that have a small TTL. In both cases it is unlikely that a prefetch would be triggered, and so the cache expires and the next client will have to wait for the network resolution.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6NcCnqSXw360PiHjNzeq2y/4e2305dada9a66609edb4fc4264d20e5/image1-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"825\" height=\"107\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In our case, the records have a 30 second TTL, so frequently no requests come in during the yellow &quot;prefetch&quot; stage, which bumps the records out of the cache and causes the next client to have to wait for the slow network resolution.

The Unbound version used for tests was 1.13.0 and the stale cache was configured thus:</p><ul><li><p><i>serve-expired: yes</i> - enable the stale cache.</p></li><li><p><i>serve-expired-ttl: 3600</i> - this limits the serving of expired resources to one hour after they expire and no response from upstream was obtained.</p></li><li><p><i>serve-expired-client-timeout: 500</i> - serve from stale cache only when upstream takes longer than 500ms to respond.</p></li></ul><p>The option <i>serve-expired-ttl-reset</i> was considered, which would cause the records to never expire, even with the upstream down indefinitely as long as there are regular requests for them, but it was deemed too dangerous since it could potentially last forever and applies to all entries.</p><p>Example consul zone: <b>service1.sd</b>.</p><p>While resolving this name we end up with:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">;; ANSWER SECTION:\nservice1.sd. 120 IN CNAME service1.query.consul.\nservice1.query.consul. 30 IN A 192.0.2.1\n \n;; Query time: 230 msec</pre></code>\n            <p>If we dump Unbound&#39;s cache (unbound-control dump_cache), we can find the entries there:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">service1.query.consul. 23  IN  A   192.0.2.1\nservice1.sd.   113 IN  CNAME   service1.query.consul.</pre></code>\n            <p>If we wait for the TTL of these entries to expire and dump the cache again, we notice that they don&#39;t show up anymore:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">➜ unbound-control dump_cache | grep -e query.consul -e service1\n➜</pre></code>\n            <p>But if we block access to the Consul resolver, we can see that still the entries are returned:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">;; ANSWER SECTION:\nservice1.sd. 119 IN CNAME service1.query.consul.\nservice1.query.consul. 30 IN A 192.0.2.1\n \n;; Query time: 503 msec</pre></code>\n            <p>Notice that Unbound waited 500ms before returning a response, which was the value we configured. This also shows that the dump cache method does not return expired entries even though they are present. So far so good.</p><h5><b>Test - Unbound could serve stale records from cache indefinitely</b></h5><p>After 3600 seconds pass we again try to resolve the same name:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">➜ dig  service1.sd. @127.0.0.1\n \n; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.10.6 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; service1.sd. @127.0.0.1\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached</pre></code>\n            <p>Dig gave up on waiting for a response from Unbound. So we see that after the configured time, Unbound will indeed stop serving the stale record, even if it has been requested recently. This is due to <i>serve-expired-ttl: 3600</i> and <i>serve-expired-ttl-reset</i> being set to &quot;no&quot; by default. These options were not available when we first tried Unbound’s stale cache.</p><h5><b>Test - Unbound serves negative/incomplete information from the expired cache</b></h5><p>Since the record we are resolving includes a CNAME and an A record with different TTLs, we will try to see if Unbound can be made to return an incomplete chain (CNAME with no A record).</p><p>We start by having both entries in cache, and block connections to the Consul resolver.

The next attempt was served from the fresh cache, hence the 0ms response time, and so we know that the cache was refreshed in the background.</p><h4><b>Test notes</b></h4><p>All the test scenarios completed successfully, even though we did find an <a href=\"https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/issues/394\">issue</a> that has since been fixed upstream. We realised that the prefetching logic blocked the cache while it attempted to refresh the entry, which prevented stale entries from being served if the upstream was unresponsive. This fix is included in version 1.13.1.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"deployment-status\">Deployment status</h2>\n            <a href=\"#deployment-status\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>This change has already been deployed to all of our data centers, and while the change addressed our original use case, there were some interesting side-effects as can be seen from the graphs below.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"decreased-in-flight-requests\">Decreased in-flight requests</h3>\n            <a href=\"#decreased-in-flight-requests\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5SEqkHk3xrVWSixpgdbdZa/7efa3f7c24e00772122d5b2e41efc353/image2-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1624\" height=\"844\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The graph above is from the Toronto data center which received the change at approximately 14:00 UTC.
