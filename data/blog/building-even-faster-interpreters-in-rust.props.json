We’ve been surprised in the past by optimizations that look good on paper, but, when tested out in production, just don’t seem to do much.</p><p>Our solution? Performance measurement as a service — an isolated and reproducible benchmark for our Firewall engine and a framework for engineers to easily request runs and view results. It’s worth noting that we took a lot of inspiration from the fantastic <a href=\"https://perf.rust-lang.org/\">Rust Compiler benchmarks</a> to build this.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2j6ou7jUofaSYjEjoMej25/a380fb67cdca84b7b95ff13eb8d98203/image3-10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"719\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Our benchmarking framework, showing how performance during different stages of processing Wirefilter expressions has changed over time [1].</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"what-to-measure\">What to measure?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#what-to-measure\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Our next challenge was to find some meaningful performance metrics. Some experimentation quickly uncovered that time was far too volatile a measure for meaningful comparisons, so we turned to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_performance_counter\">hardware counters</a> [2]. It’s not hard to find tools to measure these (<a href=\"https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page\">perf</a> and <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/vtune-profiler.html\">VTune</a> are two such examples), although they (<a href=\"https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/vtune-help/top/api-support/instrumentation-and-tracing-technology-apis/instrumentation-and-tracing-technology-api-reference/collection-control-api.html\">mostly</a>) don’t allow control over which parts of the program are recorded. In our case, we wished to individually record measurements for different stages of filter processing — parsing, compilation, analysis, and execution.</p><p>Once again we took inspiration from the Rust compiler, and its <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/02/25/intro-rustc-self-profile.html\">self-profiling options</a>, using the <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html\">perf_event_open</a> API to record counters from <i>inside</i> our binary. We then output something like the following, which our framework can easily ingest and store for later visualization.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5rMHtBLVjfrHV0BMfTvaZV/a53037be7211be732df9ced5169b8fe7/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-10.20.42.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1338\" height=\"860\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Output of our benchmarks in <a href=\"https://jsonlines.org/\">JSON Lines</a> format, showing a list of recordings for each combination of hardware counter and Wirefilter processing stage. We’ve used 10 repeats here for readability, but we use around 20, in addition to 5 warmup rounds, within our framework.</p><p>Whilst we mainly focussed on metrics relating to CPU usage, we also use a combination of <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrusage.2.html\"><code>getrusage</code></a> and <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=695f055936938c674473ea071ca7359a863551e7\"><code>clear_refs</code></a> to find the maximum resident set size (RSS). This is useful to understand the memory impact of <a href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/aho-corasick\">particular algorithms</a> in addition to CPU.</p><p>But the challenge was not over. Cloudflare’s standard CI agents use virtualization and sandboxing for security and convenience, but this makes accessing hardware counters virtually impossible. Running our benchmarks on a dedicated machine gave us access to these counters, and ensured more reproducible results.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"speeding-up-the-speed-test\">Speeding up the speed test</h3>\n            <a href=\"#speeding-up-the-speed-test\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Our benchmarks were designed from the outset to take an important place in our development process. For instance, we now perform a full benchmark run before releasing each new version to detect performance regressions.</p><p>But with our benchmarks in place, it quickly became clear that we had a problem. Our benchmarks simply weren’t fast enough — at least if we wanted to complete them in less than a few hours! The problem was we have a very large number  of filters. Since our engine would never usually execute requests against this many filters at once it was proving incredibly costly. We came up with a few tricks to cut this down…</p><ul><li><p><b><b><b>Deduplication.</b></b></b> It turns out that only around a third of filters are structurally unique (something that is easy to check as Wirefilter can helpfully serialize to JSON). We managed to cut down a great deal of time by ignoring duplicate filters in our benchmarks.</p></li><li><p><b><b><b>Sampling.</b></b></b> Still, we had too many filters and random sampling presented an easy solution. A more subtle challenge was to make sure that the random sample was always the same to maintain reproducibility.</p></li><li><p><b><b><b>Partitioning.</b></b></b> We worried that deduplication and sampling would cause us to miss important cases that are useful to optimize. By first partitioning filters by Wirefilter language feature, we can ensure we’re getting a good range of filters. It also helpfully gives us more detail about where specifically the impact of a performance change is.</p></li></ul><p>Most of these are trade-offs, but very necessary ones which allow us to run continual benchmarks without development speed grinding to a halt. At the time of writing, we’ve managed to get a benchmark run down to around 20 minutes using these ideas.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"optimizing-our-engine\">Optimizing our engine</h3>\n            <a href=\"#optimizing-our-engine\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>With a benchmarking framework in place, we were ready to begin testing optimizations. But how do you optimize an interpreter like Wirefilter? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation\">Just-in-time (JIT) compilation</a>, <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/277652.277743\">selective inlining</a> and <a href=\"http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/andi/papers/dotnet_06.pdf\">replication</a> were some ideas floating around in the word of interpreters that seemed attractive. After all, we <a href=\"/building-fast-interpreters-in-rust/\">previously wrote</a> about the cost of dynamic dispatch in Wirefilter. All of these techniques aim to reduce that effect.</p><p>However, running some real filters through a profiler tells a different story. Most execution time, around 65%, is spent not resolving dynamic dispatch calls but instead performing <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-firewall-language/operators/#comparison-operators\">operations</a> like comparison and searches. Filters currently in production tend to be pretty light on functions, but throw in a few more of these and even less time would be spent on dynamic dispatch. We suspect that even a fair chunk of the remaining 35% is actually spent reading the memory of request fields.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-7btt{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n</style>\n<table class=\"tg\" width=\"100%\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-7btt\">Function</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-7btt\">CPU time</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\"><span style=\"color:#905;background-color:#ddd\">`matches`</span> operator</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">0.6%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\"><span style=\"color:#905;background-color:#ddd\">`in`</span> operator</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">1.1%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\"><span style=\"color:#905;background-color:#ddd\">`eq`</span> operator</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">11.8%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\"><span style=\"color:#905;background-color:#ddd\">`contains`</span> operator</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">51.5%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Everything else</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">35.0%</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<figcaption>Breakdown of CPU time while executing a typical production filter.</figcaption><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"an-adventure-in-substring-searching\">An adventure in substring searching</h3>\n            <a href=\"#an-adventure-in-substring-searching\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>By now, you shouldn’t be surprised that the <code>contains</code> operator was one of the first in line for optimization.

In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm\">string searching algorithms</a>, this is commonly referred to as finding a ‘needle’ (“example”) within a ‘haystack’ (“example.com”).</p><p><code>http.host contains “example”</code></p><p>How does this work under the hood? Ordinarily, we may have used Rust’s <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.contains\">`String::contains` function</a> but Wirefilter also allows raw byte expressions that don’t necessarily conform to UTF-8.</p><p><code>http.host contains 65:78:61:6d:70:6c:65</code></p><p>We therefore used the <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/memmem\">memmem crate</a> which performs a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_string-matching_algorithm\">two-way substring search algorithm</a> on raw bytes.</p><p>Sounds good, right? It was, and it was working pretty well, although we’d noticed that rewriting `contains` filters using regular expressions could bizarrely often make them faster.</p><p><code>http.host matches “example”</code></p><p>Regular expressions are great, but since they’re far more powerful than the `contains` operator, they shouldn’t be faster than a specialized algorithm in simple cases like this one.</p><p>Something was definitely up. It turns out that <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/regex\">Rust’s regex library</a> comes equipped with <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/691606773f525be32a59a0c28eae203a79663706/src/literal/imp.rs#L24\">a whole host</a> of specialized matchers for what it deems to be simple expressions like this. The obvious question was whether we could therefore simply use the regex library. Interestingly, you may not have realized that the popular ripgrep tool does <a href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/1b2c1dc67583d70d1d16fc93c90db80bead4fb09/crates/core/args.rs#L1479\">just that</a> when searching for fixed-string patterns.</p><p>However, our use case is a little different. Since we’re building an interpreter (and we’re using dynamic dispatch in any case), we would prefer to dispatch to a specialized case for `contains` expressions, rather than matching on some enum deep within the regex crate when the filter is executed. What’s more, there are some <a href=\"http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-strfind.html\">pretty</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/intel/hyperscan\">cool</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/jneem/teddy\">things</a> being done to perform substring searching that leverages SIMD instruction sets.

It simply continues reading into the oblivion after the end of the haystack until the last register is full, and uses a bitmask to ignore potential false-positives from this additional region of memory.</p><p>As we mentioned, security is our priority when it comes to optimizations, so we could never deploy something with this kind of behaviour. We ended up porting Muła’s library to Rust (we’ve also <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/sliceslice\">open-sourced the crate</a>!) and performed an <a href=\"https://community.arm.com/developer/ip-products/processors/b/processors-ip-blog/posts/coding-for-neon---part-2-dealing-with-leftovers\">overlapping registers modification</a> found in ARM’s blog.</p><p>It’s best illustrated by example — notice the difference between how we would fill registers on an imaginary SIMD instruction-set with 4-byte registers.</p><p><b>Before modification</b></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3OUJ2AojfLLoz1mZepPjg0/1b98003bf5fb2a44fed2366f6840fcae/image1-16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"225\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>How registers are filled in the original implementation for the haystack “abcdefghij”, red squares indicate out of bounds memory.</p><p><b>After modification</b></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2j5TTWwSXcV1Rtu7Uaoqsf/138c36a096cc6c201777028933a3f49c/image4-10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"228\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>How registers are filled with the overlapping modification for the same haystack, notice how ‘g’ and ‘h’ each appear in two registers.</p><p>In our case, repeating some bytes within two different registers will never change the final outcome, so this modification is allowed as-is.

In this case, we can’t use our overlapping trick since there’s nothing to overlap with. Our solution is straightforward: while we were primarily targeting AVX2, which can store 32-bytes in a lane, we can easily move down to another instruction set with smaller registers that the haystack can fit into. In reality, we don’t currently go any smaller than SSE2. Beyond this, we instead use an implementation of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm\">Rabin-Karp searching algorithm</a> which appears to perform well.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-7btt{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n</style>\n<table class=\"tg\" width=\"100%\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-7btt\">Instruction set</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-7btt\">Register size</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">AVX2</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">32 bytes</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">SSE2</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">16 bytes</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">SWAR (u64)</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">8 bytes</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">SWAR (u32)</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">4 bytes</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">...</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">...</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<figcaption>Register sizes in different SIMD instruction sets [3].
