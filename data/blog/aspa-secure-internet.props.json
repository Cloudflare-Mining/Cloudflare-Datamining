However, this traffic can sometimes be misdirected due to configuration errors or malicious actions. When traffic is routed through networks it was not intended to pass through, it is known as a <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7908\"><u>route leak</u></a>.

To address this, the industry is adopting a new cryptographic standard called <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification/\"><u>ASPA (Autonomous System Provider Authorization)</u></a>, which is designed to validate the entire path of network traffic and prevent route leaks.</p><p>To help the community track the rollout of this standard, Cloudflare Radar has introduced a new ASPA deployment monitoring feature. This view allows users to observe ASPA adoption trends over time across the five<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry\"><u> Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)</u></a>, and view ASPA records and changes over time at the<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/\"><u> Autonomous System (AS)</u></a> level.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"what-is-aspa\">What is ASPA?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#what-is-aspa\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-start-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>To understand how ASPA works, it is helpful to look at how the Internet currently secures traffic destinations.</p><p>Today, networks use a secure infrastructure system called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure\"><u>RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure)</u></a>, which has seen <a href=\"https://blog.apnic.net/2026/02/20/rpkis-2025-year-in-review/\"><u>significant deployment growth</u></a> over the past few years. Within RPKI, networks publish specific cryptographic records called ROAs (Route Origin Authorizations). A ROA acts as a verifiable digital ID card, confirming that an Autonomous System (AS) is officially authorized to announce specific IP addresses. This addresses the &quot;origin hijacks&quot; issue, where one network attempts to impersonate another.</p><p><a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification/\"><u>ASPA (Autonomous System Provider Authorization)</u></a> builds directly on this foundation. While a ROA verifies the <i>destination</i>, an ASPA record verifies the <i>journey</i>.</p><p>When data travels across the Internet, it keeps a running log of every network it passes through. In BGP, this log is known as the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4271#section-5.1.2\"><code><u>AS_PATH</u></code></a> (Autonomous System Path). ASPA provides networks with a way to officially publish a list of their authorized upstream providers within the RPKI system. This allows any receiving network to look at the <code>AS_PATH</code>, check the associated ASPA records, and verify that the traffic only traveled through an approved chain of networks.</p><p>A ROA helps ensure the traffic arrives at the correct destination, ASPA ensures the traffic takes an intended, authorized route to get there. Let’s take a look at how path evaluation actually works in practice.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"route-leak-detection-with-aspa\">Route leak detection with ASPA</h2>\n      <a href=\"#route-leak-detection-with-aspa\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-start-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>How does ASPA know if a route is a <i>detour</i>?

In the opposite direction, these are also the networks you authorize to send you a full routing table, which acts as the complete map of how to reach the rest of the Internet.</p><p>We’d like to show you just how easy creating an ASPA object is with a quick example. </p><p>Say we need to create the ASPA object for AS203898, an AS we use for our Cloudflare London office Internet. At the time of writing we have three Internet providers for the office: AS8220, AS2860, and AS1273. This means we will create an ASPA object for AS203898 with those three provider members in a list.</p><p>First, we log into the RIPE <a href=\"https://dashboard.rpki.ripe.net/#overview\"><u>RPKI dashboard</u></a> and navigate to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rpki.ripe.net/#aspa\"><u>ASPA</u></a> section:</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3CCFItZpP8JbYCotDGfuM3/c7ad0041ceea4f48c37ff59f416f8242/7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"946\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Then, we click on “Create ASPA” for the object we want to create an ASPA object for. From there, we just fill in the providers for that AS. </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6ABmfhRQQRbLhMat6Ug01K/3a9d73ad8ade315416c4cc6eb9073ada/8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"946\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>It’s as simple as that.

However, those who have been around since the start of RPKI for route origin validation know <a href=\"https://manrs.org/2023/05/estimating-the-timeline-for-aspa-deployment/\"><u>this will be a long road</u></a> to actually providing significant value on the Internet. Changes are needed to RPKI Relaying Party (RP) packages, signer implementations, RTR (RPKI-to-Router protocol) software, and BGP implementations to actually use ASPA objects and validate paths with them.</p><p>In addition to ASPA adoption, operators should also configure BGP roles as described within <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9234/\"><u>RFC9234</u></a>. The BGP roles configured on BGP sessions will help future ASPA implementations on routers <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification-24#section-6.3\"><u>decide which algorithm to apply</u></a>: <i>upstream</i> or <i>downstream</i>. In other words, BGP roles give us the power as operators to directly tie our intended BGP relationships with another AS to sessions with those neighbors. Check with your routing vendors and make sure they support <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9234/\"><u>RFC9234 BGP roles and OTC</u></a> (Only-to-Customer) attribute implementation.</p><p>To get the most out of ASPA, we encourage everyone to create their ASPA objects for their AS<i>. </i>Creating and maintaining these ASPA objects requires careful attention. In the future, as networks use these records to actively block invalid paths, omitting a legitimate provider could cause traffic to be dropped. However, managing this risk is no different from how networks already handle Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) today. ASPA is the necessary cryptographic upgrade for Internet path validation, and we’re happy it’s here!</p>",
