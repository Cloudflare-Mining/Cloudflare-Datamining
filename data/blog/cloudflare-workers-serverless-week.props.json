We <a href=\"/introducing-cloudflare-workers/\">announced Cloudflare Workers</a> nearly three years ago and it&#39;s been generally available for the last two years. Over that time, we&#39;ve seen hundreds of thousands of developers write tens of millions of lines of code that now run across Cloudflare&#39;s network.</p><p>Just last quarter, 20,000 developers deployed for the first time a new application using Cloudflare Workers. More than 10% of all requests flowing through our network today use Cloudflare Workers. And, among our largest customers, approximately 20% are adopting Cloudflare Workers as part of their deployments. It&#39;s been incredible to watch the platform grow.</p><p>Over the course of the coming week, which we’re calling Serverless Week, we&#39;re going to be announcing a series of enhancements to the Cloudflare Workers platform to allow you to build much more complicated applications, lower your serverless computing bills, make your applications even faster, and prove that the Workers platform is secure to its core.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"matthews-hierarchy-of-developers-needs\">Matthew’s Hierarchy of Developers&#39; Needs</h3>\n      <a href=\"#matthews-hierarchy-of-developers-needs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Before the week begins, I wanted to step back and talk a bit about what we&#39;ve learned about edge computing over the course of the last three years. When we launched Cloudflare Workers we thought the killer feature was speed. Workers run across the Cloudflare network, closer to end users, so they inherently have faster response times than legacy, centralized serverless platforms.</p><p>However, we’ve learned by watching developers use Cloudflare Workers that there are a number of attributes to a development platform that are far more important than just speed. Speed is the icing on the cake, but it’s not, for most applications, an initial requirement. Focusing only on it is a mistake that will doom edge computing platforms to obscurity.</p><p>Today, almost everyone who talks about the benefits of edge computing still focuses on speed. So did Akamai, which <a href=\"https://www.akamai.com/fr/fr/multimedia/documents/technical-publication/edgecomputing-extending-enterprise-applications-to-the-edge-of-the-internet-technical-publication.pdf\">launched their Java- and .NET-based EdgeComputing platform in 2002</a>, only to shut it down in 2009 after failing to find enough customers where a bit less network latency alone justified the additional cost and complexity of running code at the edge. That’s a cautionary tale much of the industry has forgotten.</p><p>Today, I’m convinced that we were wrong when we launched Cloudflare Workers to think of speed as the killer feature of edge computing, and much of the rest of the industry’s focus remains largely misplaced and risks missing a much larger opportunity.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3b1XdFo7wQqjOPIBwRDFKX/b3e1738c381f7b7a6d0fcb893789483e/Developer-Hierarchy-of-Needs_2x-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"902\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>I&#39;d propose instead that what developers on any platform need, from least to most important, is actually: Speed &lt; Consistency &lt; Cost &lt; Ease of Use &lt; Compliance. Call it: Matthew’s Hierarchy of Developers’ Needs. While nearly everyone talking about edge computing has focused on speed, I&#39;d argue that consistency, cost, ease of use, and especially compliance will ultimately be far more important. In fact, I predict the real killer feature of edge computing over the next three years will have to do with the relatively unsexy but foundationally important: regulatory compliance.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"speed-as-the-killer-feature\">Speed As the Killer Feature?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#speed-as-the-killer-feature\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, speed is great.

Only a limited set of applications are sensitive to network latency of a few hundred milliseconds. That&#39;s not to say under the model of a modern major serverless platform network latency doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s just that the applications that require that extra performance are niche.</p><p>Applications like credit card processing, ad delivery, gaming, and human-computer interactions can be very latency sensitive. Amazon&#39;s Alexa and Google Home, for instance, are better than many of their competitors in part because they can take advantage of their corporate parents&#39; edge networks to handle voice processing and therefore have lower latency and feel more responsive.</p><p>But after applications like that, it gets pretty &quot;hand wavy.&quot; People who talk a lot about edge computing quickly start talking about IoT and driverless cars. Embarrassingly, when we first launched the Workers platform, I caught myself doing that all the time.

A cold start is how long it takes to run an application the first time it executes on a particular server. Cold starts hurt because they make an application unpredictable and inconsistent. Sometimes a serverless application can be fast, if it&#39;s hitting a server where the code is hot, but other times it&#39;s slow when a container on a new server needs to be spun up and code loaded from disk into memory. Unpredictability really hurts user experience; turns out humans love consistency more than they love speed.</p><p>The problem of cold starts is not unique to edge computing platforms. Inconsistency from cold starts are the bane of all serverless platforms. They are the tax you pay for not having to maintain and deploy your own instances. But edge computing platforms can actually make the cold start problem worse because they spread the computing workload across more servers in more locations. As a result, it&#39;s less likely that code will be &quot;warm&quot; on any particular server when a request arrives.</p><p>In other words, the more distributed a platform is, the more likely it is to have a cold start problem. And to work around that on most serverless platforms, developers have to create horrible hacks like performing idle requests to their own application from around the world so that their code stays hot. Adding insult to injury, the legacy cloud providers charge for those throw-away requests, or charge even more for their own hacky pre-warming/”reserved” solutions. It’s absurd!</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"zero-nanosecond-cold-starts\">Zero Nanosecond Cold Starts</h3>\n      <a href=\"#zero-nanosecond-cold-starts\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We knew cold starts were important, so, from the beginning, we worked to ensure that cold starts with Workers were under 5 milliseconds.

Developers are only willing to start paying extra for speed when they see user experience being harmed to the point of costing them even more than what a speed upgrade would cost. Until then, cheap beats fast.</p><p>For the most part, edge computing platforms charge a premium for being faster. For instance, a request processed via AWS&#39;s Lambda@Edge costs approximately <a href=\"https://medium.com/@zackbloom/serverless-pricing-and-costs-aws-lambda-and-lambda-edge-169bfb58db75\">three times more than a request processed via AWS Lambda</a>; and basic Lambda is already outrageously expensive. That may seem to make sense in some ways — we all assume we need to pay more to be faster — but it’s a pricing rationale that will always make edge computing a niche product servicing only those limited applications extremely sensitive to network latency.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2MiLUX8P0COo3EpAVUOijZ/fb6023e472b58c5b69a6dd3c5feb895c/cost_2x-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"433\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>But edge computing doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be more expensive. In fact, it can be cheaper. To understand, look at the cost of delivering services from the edge. If you&#39;re well-peered with local ISPs, like Cloudflare&#39;s network is, it can be less expensive to deliver bandwidth locally than it is to backhaul it around the world. There can be additional savings on the cost of power and colocation when running at the edge. Those are savings that we can use to help keep the price of the Cloudflare Workers platform low.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"more-efficient-architecture-means-lower-costs\">More Efficient Architecture Means Lower Costs</h3>\n      <a href=\"#more-efficient-architecture-means-lower-costs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>But the real cost win comes from a more efficient architecture. Back in the early-90s when I was a network administrator at my college, when we wanted to add a new application it meant ordering a new server. (We bought servers from Gateway; I thought their cardboard shipping boxes with the cow print were fun.) Then virtual machines (VMs) came along and you could run multiple applications on the same server. Effectively, the overhead per application went down because you needed fewer physical servers per application.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6G1F70GpwLdYuBRr8CIyKS/56b0daadfe97ff71669cf9712ecbae3e/pasted-image-0--1--1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"512\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>VMs gave rise to the first public clouds. Quickly, however, cloud providers looked for ways to reduce their overhead further. Containers provided a lighter weight option to run multiple customers’ workloads on the same machine, with dotCloud, which <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/news/2013/10/dotcloud-renamed-docker/\">went on to become Docker</a>, leading the way and nearly everyone else eventually following. Again, the win with containers over VMs was reducing the overhead per application.</p><p>At Cloudflare, we knew history doesn’t stop, so as we started building Workers we asked ourselves: what comes after containers? <a href=\"/cloud-computing-without-containers/\">The answer was isolates</a>. Isolates are the sandboxing technology that your browser uses to keep processes separate. They are extremely fast and lightweight. It’s why, when you visit a website, your browser can take code it’s never seen before and execute it almost instantly.</p><p>By using isolates, rather than containers or virtual machines, we&#39;re able to keep computation overhead much lower than traditional serverless platforms. That allows us to much more efficiently handle compute workloads. We, in turn, can pass the savings from that efficiency on to our customers. We aim not to be less expensive than Lambda@Edge, it’s to be less expensive than Lambda. Much less expensive.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"from-limits-to-limitless\">From Limits to Limitless</h3>\n      <a href=\"#from-limits-to-limitless\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Originally, we wanted Workers’ pricing to be very simple and cost effective. Instead of charging for requests, CPU time, <i>and</i> bandwidth, like other serverless providers, we just charged per request. Simple. The tradeoff was that we were forced to impose maximum CPU, memory, and application size restrictions. What we’ve seen over the last three years is developers want to build more complicated, sophisticated applications using Workers — some of which pushed the boundaries of these limits. So this week we’re taking the limits off.</p><p>Tomorrow we’ll announce a new Workers option that allows you to run much more complicated computer workloads following the same pricing model that other serverless providers use, but at much more compelling rates. We’ll continue to support our simplified option for users who can live within the previous limits. I’m especially excited to see how developers will be able to harness our technology to build new applications, all at a lower cost and better performance than other legacy, centralized serverless platforms.</p><p>Faster, more consistent, and cheaper are great, but even together those alone aren&#39;t enough to win over most developers workloads.

I know firsthand because when I need to write a program I still reach for a trusty language I know like Perl (don&#39;t judge me) even if it&#39;s slower and more costly. I am not alone.</p><p>That&#39;s why with Cloudflare Workers we knew we needed to meet developers where they were already comfortable. That starts with supporting the languages that developers know and love. We&#39;ve previously announced support for JavaScript, C, C++, Rust, Go, and <a href=\"/cloudflare-workers-now-support-cobol/\">even COBOL</a>. This week we&#39;ll be announcing support for Python, Scala, and Kotlin. We want to make sure you don&#39;t have to learn a new language and a new platform to get the benefits of Cloudflare Workers. (I’m still pushing for Perl support.)</p><p>Ease also means spending less time on things like technical operations. That&#39;s where serverless platforms have excelled. Being able to simply deploy code and allow the platform to scale up and down with load is magical. We’ve seen this with long-time users of Cloudflare Workers like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/discord/\">Discord</a>, which has experienced several thousand percent usage growth over the last three years and the Workers platform has automatically scaled to meet their needs.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2dWO9UYrGYny5thzMuV8IM/0648a0518a458ae04d918f0d7bf96f45/ease-of-use_2x-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"433\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>One challenge, however, of serverless platforms is debugging. Since, as a developer, it can be difficult to replicate the entire serverless platform locally, debugging your applications can be more difficult. This is compounded when deploying code to a platform <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/slashing-cloudfront-change-propagation-times-in-2020-recent-changes-and-looking-forward/\">takes as long as 5 minutes, as it can with AWS&#39;s Lamda@Edge</a>. If you’re a developer, you know how painful waiting for your code to be deployed and testable can be. That&#39;s why it was critical to us that code changes be deployed globally to our entire network across more than 200 cities in less than 15 seconds.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-bezos-rule\">The Bezos Rule</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-bezos-rule\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>One of the most important decisions we made internally was to implement what we call the Bezos Rule.

And we’ll continue to build tools that give developers options for satisfying their compliance obligations, without having to sacrifice the efficiencies the cloud has enabled.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/CFx61V129m3gLfCJF91ho/1a3ba84d45d27fb5f52012d40d5f445e/Edge-computing-to-the-rescue-_2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"781\" height=\"791\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The ultimate promise of serverless has been to allow any developer to say “I don’t care where my code runs, just make it scale.” Increasingly, another promise will need to be “I do care where my code runs, and I need more control to satisfy my compliance department.” Cloudflare Workers allows you the best of both worlds, with instant scaling, locations that span more than 100 countries around the world, and the granularity to choose exactly what you need.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"serverless-week\">Serverless Week</h3>\n      <a href=\"#serverless-week\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The best part? We’re just getting started. Over the coming week, we’ll discuss our vision for serverless and show you how we’re building Cloudflare Workers into the fastest, most cost effective, secure, flexible, robust, easy to use serverless platform. We’ll also highlight use cases from customers who are using Cloudflare Workers to build and scale applications in a way that was previously impossible. And we’ll outline enhancements we’ve made to the platform to make it even better for developers going forward.</p><p>We’ve truly come a long way over the last three years of building out this platform, and I can’t wait to see all the new applications developers build with Cloudflare Workers.
