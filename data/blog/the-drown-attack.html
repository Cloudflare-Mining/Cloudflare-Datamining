	<p>CloudFlare customers are automatically protected against the recently disclosed <a href="https://www.drownattack.com/" target="_blank">DROWN Attack</a>. We do not have SSLv2 enabled on our servers.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2016/03/DROWN_logo.svg" alt=""></p>
	<p>We publish our SSL configuration <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/sslconfig" target="_blank">here</a> so that others can use it. We currently accept TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.</p>
	<p>We are proactively testing our customers' origin web servers to detect vulnerable servers and will be reaching out to any that have a server that is <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/" target="_blank">vulnerable to DROWN</a>.</p>
	<p>In the interim, ensure that SSLv2 is fully disabled and/or that private keys are not shared with servers that still need to have SSLv2.</p>
