The fact that 72% of DDoS attacks were mitigated by our home-grown heuristics showcases the advantages of operating a large network. The volume of traffic and attacks that we see let us craft, test, and deploy robust defenses against botnets.</p><p>Another 13% of HTTP DDoS attacks were mitigated due to their suspicious or unusual HTTP attributes, and another 9% were HTTP DDoS attacks launched by fake browsers or browser impersonators. The remaining 6% of “Other” includes attacks that targeted login endpoints and cache busting attacks.</p><p>One thing to note is that these attack vectors, or attack groups, are not necessarily exclusive. For example, known botnets also impersonate browsers and have suspicious HTTP attributes, but this breakdown is our attempt to categorize the HTTP DDoS attacks in a meaningful way.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7s2ClnOzWZcefqsiNRrs85/560a7cc1f256c24f733a6d784c2a6b83/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1381\" height=\"771\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Distribution of DDoS attacks in 2024 Q3</i></sup></p><p>In Q3, we observed a 4,000% increase in <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/ssdp-ddos-attack/\"><u>SSDP amplification attacks</u></a> compared to the previous quarter. An SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) attack is a type of reflection and amplification DDoS attack that exploits the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play\"><u>UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) protocol</u></a>. Attackers send SSDP requests to vulnerable UPnP-enabled devices such as routers, printers, and IP-enabled cameras, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing/\"><u>spoof</u></a> the source IP address to be the victim’s IP address. These devices respond to the victim’s IP address with large amounts of traffic, overwhelming the victim’s infrastructure. The amplification effect allows attackers to generate massive traffic from small requests, causing the victim’s service to go offline. Disabling UPnP on unnecessary devices and using DDoS mitigation strategies can help defend against this attack.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5hK3wMmUM2m7QbEi9zkNJe/fa4ba3f7d8c7a6e35a681ad068694cfd/image5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1660\" height=\"1092\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Illustration of an SSDP amplification attack</i></sup></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"user-agents-used-in-http-ddos-attacks\">User agents used in HTTP DDoS attacks</h3>\n            <a href=\"#user-agents-used-in-http-ddos-attacks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>When launching HTTP DDoS attacks, threat actors want to blend in to avoid detection.

Threat actors typically avoid using uncommon user agents, as evidenced by the frequent use of Chrome user agents in cyberattacks. Therefore, the presence of <i>HITV_ST_PLATFORM</i> likely suggests that the devices in question are indeed compromised smart TVs or set-top boxes.</p><p>In seventh place, we saw the <a href=\"https://www.utorrent.com/\"><i><u>uTorrent</u></i></a> user agent being used in attacks. This user agent is associated with a popular BitTorrent client that’s used for downloading files.</p><p>Lastly, <a href=\"https://square.github.io/okhttp/\"><i><u>okhttp</u></i></a> was the least common user agent in DDoS attacks despite its popularity as an HTTP client for Java and Android applications. </p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"http-attack-attributes\">HTTP attack attributes</h3>\n            <a href=\"#http-attack-attributes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>While 89% of HTTP DDoS attack traffic used the GET method, it is also the most commonly used HTTP method.

In the case of threat actors, while 80% of survey respondents said that they don’t know who attacked them, 20% said they did. Of those, 32% said that the threat actors were extortionists. Another 25% said a competitor attacked them, and another 21% said that a disgruntled customer or user was behind the attack. 14% of respondents said that the attacks were carried out by a state or a state-sponsored group. Lastly, 7% said that they mistakenly attacked themselves.

This mirrors a similar trend from the same period last year, when application layer attacks in the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack\"><u>HTTP/2 Rapid Reset</u></a> campaign exceeded 200 million requests per second (Mrps). These massive attacks are capable of overwhelming Internet properties, particularly those relying on capacity-limited cloud services or on-premise solutions.</p><p>The increasing use of powerful botnets, fueled by geopolitical tensions and global events, is expanding the range of organizations at risk — many of which were not traditionally considered prime targets for DDoS attacks. Unfortunately, too many organizations reactively deploy DDoS protections after an attack has already caused significant damage.</p><p>Our observations confirm that businesses with well-prepared, comprehensive security strategies are far more resilient against these cyberthreats. At Cloudflare, we’re committed to safeguarding your Internet presence. Through significant investment in our automated defenses and a robust portfolio of security products, we ensure proactive protection against both current and emerging threats — so you don’t have to.</p>",
