	<p>Cloudflare's commitment to building the most compelling and easy-to-use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase">SASE</a> platform on the market has led to significant growth over the past year. Cloudflare One services have seen the fastest adoption among our customers, with a 3x increase in partner bookings and a 70% YoY increase in transacting partners. Partners consistently cite the simplicity of our platform, our innovation, and our global network as key differentiators that are driving strong customer demand.</p>
	<p>To continue building on this momentum and deliver required services that our customers may require, we previously announced the creation of our new specialization track for Authorized Services Delivery Partners (ASDP) as part of our efforts to continue growing our partnership program.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare's Authorized Services Delivery Partner track is designed to authorize partners that meet our high standards for professional services delivery around Cloudflare One. Partners who undergo the rigorous technical validation process and meet the criteria for security, performance, and reliability of their services delivery capabilities are designated as Cloudflare Authorized Service Delivery Partners. This designation provides a variety of benefits, including access to Cloudflare One sourced opportunities requiring services, access to named Cloudflare One Service Delivery Managers, and access to special partner incentive funds designed to ensure that authorized partner services are actively used in Cloudflare One customer engagements.</p>
	<p>In addition, we're pleased to announce that our authorized partners, with their deep skills and capabilities, will play a critical role in the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/descaler-program">Descaler Program</a>. Authorized partners will work closely with customers to understand their unique needs and goals, and provide strategic consultation and technical expertise throughout the migration journey. Authorized partners will also have the opportunity to leverage the Descaler toolkit to automatically export settings and configurations of deployed Zscaler products to be migrated into Cloudflare, enabling a frictionless transition to Cloudflare One.</p>
	<p>Since launch, Cloudflare One's Authorized Services Delivery Partner track is having a notable impact on our partner ecosystem, providing a framework for partners to showcase their expertise in Cloudflare One services and delivering high-quality professional and managed services to customers. The program has attracted a diverse range of partners who bring different skillsets and expertise to the table, including <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> security assessments, network transformation, and advisory and migration services, among others. By authorizing partners who meet our high standards for services delivery, we are providing customers with a clear path to trusted advisors who can help them navigate their journey to a cloud-delivered SASE architecture.</p>
	<p>We are thrilled to now announce the first partners who have achieved the ASDP designation.</p>
