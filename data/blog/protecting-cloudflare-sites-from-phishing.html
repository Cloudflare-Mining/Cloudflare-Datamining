	<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b></i> This post was co-authored with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/people">Ray Bejjani</a>, CloudFlare's engineer that was the lead for this project.</p>
	<p>As the internet has grown, phishing attacks have continued to be a problem. While better awareness and focus on security has helped reduce their number, <a href="http://www.rsa.com/phishing_reports.aspx%20">the RSA</a> and other services tracking phishing still show that somewhere between <a href="http://www.rsa.com/phishing_reports.aspx%20">20-30,000 phishing attacks</a> generally occur <i><b>every month</b></i>. In the past, criminals used to launch most of these phishing attacks through email but they have now switched to hacking sites to better hide their tracks and dupe more unsuspecting consumers into divulging their personal information unknowingly to fraudsters. This can become a difficult problem for less technical users that wish to participate and contribute to the World Wide Web.</p>
	<p>Given our position in the internet ecosystem, we often receive phishing reports via our abuse channel. Previously, this meant a manual process to notify the appropriate parties especially the site owner. We felt we could serve our customers better, and their customers in turn, with a solution unique to CloudFlare. When we have identified a URL that is phishing we notify the owner and provide them summary information and notifications when they log in. We also begin serving a warning page in place of the bad URL. This page can be bypassed by the visitor at their preference.</p>

			<p>Our mission is to help make the web faster and safer.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>We can block phishing pages as soon as they are reported to us. This provides the following benefits to sites using CloudFlare:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Stops site visitors from potentially falling victim to identity theft</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Stops site owners from being penalized for unknowingly hosting phishing content. Many search engines will blocklist your site if you're hosting malicious content, which only compounds the issue for site owners that don't know that they have been compromised</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>We can quickly notify site owners about the issue on their site quickly so they can clean up the malicious files.</p>

	<p>If you're interested in protecting your site, whether you have been hacked or not, you can take the following steps that can secure your site:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/features-security">SSL</a> on your site to encrypt information between your site and your server.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>In addition to providing a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/features-security">layer of security</a> to your site already, CloudFlare has partnered with a number of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps">app providers</a> that can help further protect site owners from malicious intrusions and provide additonal site monitoring.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Always update your site's CMS platform, plugins and server software. If you have a notification from your provider that there is a software update available, these updates were probably done to fix known exploits that have shown up since the last release to the plugin or platform. Since doing these updates often only takes a few minutes or so, you can save yourself from a potential world of hurt by doing it "now" instead of "later".</p>
