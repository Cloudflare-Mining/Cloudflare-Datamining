Cloudflare products and services around the world generate massive amounts of logs upon which customers of all sizes depend. Structured logging from our products are used by customers for purposes including analytics, debugging performance issues, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/app-performance-monitoring/\">monitoring application health</a>, maintaining security standards for compliance reasons, and much more.</p><p>Logpush is Cloudflare’s product for pushing these critical logs to customer systems for consumption and analysis. Whenever our products generate logs as a result of traffic or data passing through our systems from anywhere in the world, we buffer these logs and push them directly to customer-defined destinations like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/\">Cloudflare R2</a>, Splunk, AWS S3, and many more.</p><p>Today we are announcing three new key features related to Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/about/\">Logpush</a> product. First, the ability to have only logs matching certain criteria be sent. Second, the ability to get alerted when logs are failing to be pushed due to customer destinations having issues or network issues occurring between Cloudflare and the customer destination. In addition, customers will also be able to query for analytics around the health of Logpush jobs like how many bytes and records were pushed, number of successful pushes, and number of failing pushes.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"filtering-logs-before-they-are-pushed\">Filtering logs before they are pushed</h3>\n      <a href=\"#filtering-logs-before-they-are-pushed\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Because logs are both critical and generated with high volume, many customers have to maintain complex infrastructure just to ingest and store logs, as well as deal with ever-increasing related costs. On a typical day, a real, example customer receives about 21 billion records, or 2.1 terabytes (about 24.9 TB uncompressed) of gzip compressed logs. Over the course of a month, that could easily be hundreds of billions of events and hundreds of terabytes of data.</p><p>It is often unnecessary to store and analyze all of this data, and customers could get by with specific subsets of the data matching certain criteria. For example, a customer might want just the set of HTTP data that had status code &gt;= 400, or the set of firewall data where the action taken was to block the user.We can now achieve this in our Logpush jobs by setting specific filters on the fields of the log messages themselves. You can use either our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/filters/\">API</a> or the Cloudflare dashboard to set up filters.</p><p>To do this in the dashboard, either create a new Logpush job or modify an existing job. You will see the option to set certain filters. For example, an ecommerce customer might want to receive logs only for the checkout page where the bot score was non-zero:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/AA0ciHtY8MWoYGyHOKMnQ/bc24585b7d80216f039b8fea1d003086/image2-30.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1076\" height=\"353\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"logpush-job-alerting\">Logpush job alerting</h3>\n      <a href=\"#logpush-job-alerting\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>When logs are a critical part of your infrastructure, you want peace of mind that logging infrastructure is healthy.
