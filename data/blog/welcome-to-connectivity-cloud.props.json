Meanwhile, 46% gained responsibility for managing and securing public cloud applications in that time, and 53% were handed the thorny issue of regulatory compliance.</p><p>IT and security teams have been handed a monumental challenge: connect remote teams, on-premises teams and infrastructure, multiple cloud environments, SaaS apps, and more, so they function like a single, secure environment.

When customers speak about loss of control, they seem to be quietly wishing for something they think doesn’t exist. What they want is a connective tissue for everything IT and security are responsible for — something that reduces complexity by working with everything in the environment, being available everywhere, and performing whatever security, networking, and development functions are needed.</p><p>Further research confirmed our suspicions. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2023/new-study-reveals-cloud-giants-are-holding-businesses-captive\">Surveys of IT and security leaders</a> indicate that 72% would highly value a secure “any-to-any” cloud platform. And they said they would invest an average of 16% of their entire IT and security budget in such a platform.</p><p>That got us to thinking — what exactly would that sort of cloud platform look like? How would it accomplish everything it had to?</p><p>We’ve got answers to share: a <b>connectivity cloud.</b></p><p>A connectivity cloud is a new approach for delivering the many services companies need to secure and connect their digital environment. It’s a unified, intelligent, platform of programmable cloud-native services that enable any-to-any connectivity between all networks (enterprise and Internet), cloud environments, applications and users. It includes a huge array of security, performance, and developer services — not with an eye to replace everything everywhere, but with the ability to fit in wherever needed and consolidate many critical services onto a single platform.</p><p>A connectivity cloud is built around four fundamental principles.</p><ol><li><p><b>Deep integration —</b> Organizations rely on the Internet to connect various elements of their digital environment with their workers, partners and customers. A connectivity cloud is integrated natively with the Internet and with enterprise networks, offering secure, low-latency, infinitely scalable connectivity between every user, application, and infrastructure. It’s as fast and straightforward as the Internet at its best, without the risk or uncertainty.</p></li><li><p><b>Programmability</b> — Every enterprise digital environment has proprietary infrastructure, multiple clouds, unique compliance needs, and other highly specific tooling, processes, and configurations. A connectivity cloud’s architecture provides limitless interoperability and customizable networking, letting it adapt to those unique needs while still providing consistent user experiences and efficient management.</p></li><li><p><b>Platform intelligence —</b> Organizations need a wide variety of services to connect and secure everything in their digital environment. But integrating everything is onerous, and trying to manage it all causes inefficiency and security gaps. A well-architected connectivity cloud has a wide range of services built in at a foundational level, and analyzes extremely high volumes and varieties of traffic in order to automatically update intelligence models.</p></li><li><p><b>Simplicity —</b> Too many IT and security services means too many dashboards, leading to inefficiency, poor visibility, and alert fatigue. While 100% consolidation onto one platform isn’t the answer, a connectivity cloud greatly reduces tool sprawl and dashboard overload by managing much more of the IT environment from a single pane of glass.</p></li></ol><p>With these qualities, the connectivity cloud lets you add new services to your digital environment without losing even more control — and also helps restore control to what you’ve already got.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/22C7LcXnp8shhtBbG1EjGX/ca543f349e8765755557a99df0648ba5/image2-11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1800\" height=\"795\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"cloudflares-connectivity-cloud\">Cloudflare’s connectivity cloud</h3>\n      <a href=\"#cloudflares-connectivity-cloud\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We’ll admit we’re predisposed to find those four qualities particularly important.
