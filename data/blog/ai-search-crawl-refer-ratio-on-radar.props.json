This means that Anthropic’s AI platform Claude made nearly 71,000 HTML page requests for every HTML page referral, while Mistral sent 10x as many referrals as crawl requests. (However, traffic referred by Claude’s native app does not include a <code>Referer:</code> header, and we believe that the same holds true for traffic generated from other native apps as well. As such, because the referral counts only include traffic from the Web-based tools from these providers, these calculations may overstate the respective ratios, but it is unclear by how much.)</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1JaUDnjXMlq5YMxuKZGh7b/31210c8cd80779974450adfb4909f1cd/image7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1137\" height=\"506\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Of course, due in part to changes in crawling patterns, these ratios will change over time. The table above also displays the ratio changes as compared to the previous period, with changes ranging from increases of over 6% for DuckDuckGo and Yandex to Google’s 19.4% decrease. The week-over-week drop in Google’s ratio is related to an observed drop in crawling traffic from <code>GoogleBot</code> starting on June 24, while Yandex’s week-over-week growth is related to an observed increase in <code>YandexBot</code> crawling activity that started on June 21, as seen in the graphs below.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2UThXDeJepqM6jQCzXMvvw/f2d75d2202c33711f9eaa0a38c01a9f3/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"774\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4FDYlEWYztxZCJZMg5RPvf/b4a3dac2dc4a06b709e2ef8d74ea1bc0/image10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"774\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Radar’s Data Explorer includes a <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=bots.crawlers&groupBy=crawl_refer_ratio&dt=2025-05-01_2025-05-28\"><u>time series view of how these ratios change over time</u></a>, such as in the Baidu example below.

Because of prefetching driven by the use of <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/search-speculation-rules\"><u>speculation rules</u></a>, referral traffic coming from Google’s ASN (AS15169) is specifically excluded from analysis here, as it doesn’t represent active user consumption of content.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5pNnqBHkfJEEGioN1dhpi5/65251de2ad63e0cef0ee2340e79f2f4b/image14.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1051\" height=\"627\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Clear diurnal patterns are also visible in the referral request shares of other search platforms, although the request shares are a fraction of what is seen from Google. </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5flVZwDhtYlseH5uYDk76U/a03e9957a10983e87e4fcd8f6a9e59bf/image4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"814\" height=\"648\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Throughout June, the share of traffic referred by AI platforms was significantly lower, even in aggregate, than the share of traffic referred by search platforms.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/705m9ac6GXGgT4qshubY70/3c6c0ca43be66114be53fa607bcb857d/image8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"814\" height=\"648\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"changes-in-crawling-traffic\">Changes in crawling traffic</h3>\n      <a href=\"#changes-in-crawling-traffic\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>As noted above, the change in ratio values over time can be driven by shifts in crawling activity. These shifts are visible in the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=bots.crawlers&groupBy=user_agent&timeCompare=1\"><u>crawling traffic shares available in Data Explorer</u></a>, as well as in the raw data available via API endpoints (<a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/bots/subresources/web_crawlers/methods/timeseries_groups/\"><u>timeseries</u></a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/bots/subresources/web_crawlers/methods/summary/\"><u>summary</u></a>). In the crawler-centric view below, covering nearly the first four weeks of June 2025, we can see that the share of requests related to Google’s crawling activity for both their <code>Googlebot</code> and <code>GoogleOther</code> identifiers falls over the course of the month, with several peak/valley periods. A similar pattern <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=http&loc=as15169&dt=2025-05-31_2025-06-27\"><u>observed in HTTP request traffic from Google’s AS15169</u></a> during that same time period loosely matches this observed drop in share.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1K92yRMz57QrRH7iPvNH4V/0f7d7816fb3b22232dbee8359127b367/image11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"814\" height=\"648\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>In addition, it appears that OpenAI’s <code>GPTBot</code> saw multiple periods where little-to-no crawling activity was observed throughout the month.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/sXdBr25Y4toS2t3nvPKMm/e1313d3356130bc333a2e03574e56661/image13.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"814\" height=\"648\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"what-this-means-for-content-providers\">What this means for content providers</h2>\n      <a href=\"#what-this-means-for-content-providers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>These ratios directly impact the viability of content publication on the Internet. While they will vary over time, the trend continues to be more crawls and fewer referrals when compared in relation to each other. Legacy search index crawlers would scan your content a couple of times, or less, for each visitor sent. A site’s availability to crawlers made their revenue model more viable, not less.</p><p>The new data we are observing suggests that is no longer the case. These models continue to consume more content, more frequently, despite sending the same or less traffic to the source of its content.</p><p>We have <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ai-audit-control-ai-content-crawlers/\"><u>released new tools</u></a> over the last year to help site owners take control back. With a single click, publishers can block the kinds of AI crawlers that train against their content. And today, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pay-per-crawl\"><u>we announced new ways</u></a> to make the exchange of value fair for both sides of the equation.

The directory, shown below, displays a card for each Verified Bot, showing the bot name, a description, the bot owner and category, and verification status.
