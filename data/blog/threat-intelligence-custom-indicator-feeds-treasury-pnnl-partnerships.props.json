The feed, exposed as a Custom Indicator Feed, collects advanced insights from the Department of the Treasury and the federal government&#39;s exclusive sources. Starting today, financial institutions can create <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/\">DNS filtering policies through Cloudflare’s Gateway product</a> that leverage threat data directly from these government bodies. These policies are crucial for protecting organizations from malicious links and phishing attempts specifically targeting the financial sector.</p><p>This initiative not only supports the federal effort to strengthen cybersecurity within critical infrastructure including the financial sector, for which the Treasury is the designated lead agency, but also contributes directly to the ongoing improvement of our shared security capabilities.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"why-we-partnered-with-the-department-of-the-treasury-and-pnnl\">Why we partnered with the Department of the Treasury and PNNL</h3>\n      <a href=\"#why-we-partnered-with-the-department-of-the-treasury-and-pnnl\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Our collaboration with the Department of the Treasury and PNNL is not just a partnership, it&#39;s a solution to a critical problem where the financial industry requires timely access to actionable intelligence in order to address security threats. Our partnership is centered around the protection of critical financial institutions and their assets. By joining forces with partners like the Department of the Treasury and PNNL, we are empowering security teams to not just share information but to act swiftly and effectively against emerging threats.</p><p>Today, many security teams, both within the same industries and across sectors, exchange vital threat intelligence through out-of-band channels like email and Slack. However, the crucial step of integrating this information into an organization&#39;s security systems often remains a manual, time-consuming process. By introducing Custom Indicator Feeds, we&#39;re bridging this gap and enabling smaller security groups to automatically fortify their defenses.</p><p>The government possesses invaluable insights into emerging threats, and by joining forces, we will share this critical data with the private sector. Our combined efforts are aimed at fortifying the security of institutions in the financial sector, which is an enticing target for cybercriminals.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"introducing-custom-indicator-feeds\">Introducing Custom Indicator Feeds</h2>\n      <a href=\"#introducing-custom-indicator-feeds\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Custom Indicator Feeds enable customers to integrate approved threat intelligence feeds directly into Cloudflare&#39;s platform. Our partners, including the Department of the Treasury and PNNL, contribute to these feeds, which are regularly updated with the latest threat indicators. Custom Indicator Feeds allows for the exchange of critical data on emerging cyber threats, ensuring that all parties involved can proactively defend against ransomware, phishing attacks, and other malicious activities.</p><p>In our context, a Custom Indicator Feed primarily consists of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), which are detailed pieces of information that identify potentially malicious activity on a system or network. Examples of data included in these feeds are IP addresses, URLs, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/\">domain names</a>, and hash values of suspicious or malicious files. Each entry is enriched with context to help security professionals understand the nature of the threat it poses, such as the type of malware associated, attack patterns, and threat severity levels.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at how these feeds are created and maintained: feeds are populated with IoCs such as domain names, IP addresses, and URL paths identified across the network environments monitored by entities like PNNL for the US Treasury, and these IoCs are initially detected by IDS (Intrusion Detection System) networks that continuously monitor for suspicious activities. Once an IoC is detected, it undergoes a rigorous verification process. Analysts at PNNL and other entities review each potential threat to confirm its malicious nature. This ensures that only verified malicious indicators are added to the feeds, reducing the risk of false positives affecting a feed subscriber’s security systems. After validation, these IoCs are added to their respective Custom Indicator Feed. These feeds are then made available to authorized users via Cloudflare’s secure API, ensuring that the data is both current and actionable.</p><p>Financial institutions that are granted access to this feed can integrate these indicators into their Cloudflare DNS filtering policies, enhancing their defense against specific threats identified by federal cybersecurity efforts.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"leveraging-custom-indicator-feeds-for-enhanced-security\">Leveraging Custom Indicator Feeds for enhanced security</h3>\n      <a href=\"#leveraging-custom-indicator-feeds-for-enhanced-security\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Once authorized for an indicator feed, you can create DNS filtering policies using the data provided by simply choosing the relevant feed when creating the policy.
