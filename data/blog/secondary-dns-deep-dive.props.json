It does not provide any Cloudflare-specific information.</p><p>Secondary DNS has many use cases across the Internet; however, traditionally, it was used as a synchronized backup for when the primary DNS server was unable to respond to queries. A more modern approach involves focusing on redundancy across many different nameservers, which in many cases broadcast the same anycasted IP address.</p><p>Secondary DNS involves the unidirectional transfer of DNS zones from the primary to the Secondary DNS server(s). One primary can have any number of Secondary DNS servers that it must communicate with in order to keep track of any zone updates. A zone update is considered a change in the contents of a  zone, which ultimately leads to a Start of Authority (SOA) serial number increase. The zone’s SOA serial is one of the key elements of Secondary DNS; it is how primary and secondary servers synchronize zones. Below is an example of what an SOA record might look like during a dig query.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">example.com\t3600\tIN\tSOA\tashley.ns.cloudflare.com. dns.cloudflare.com. \n2034097105  // Serial\n10000 // Refresh\n2400 // Retry\n604800 // Expire\n3600 // Minimum TTL</pre></code>\n            <p>Each of the numbers is used in the following way:</p><ol><li><p>Serial - Used to keep track of the status of the zone, must be incremented at every change.</p></li><li><p>Refresh - The maximum number of seconds that can elapse before a Secondary DNS server must check for a SOA serial change.</p></li><li><p>Retry - The maximum number of seconds that can elapse before a Secondary DNS server must check for a SOA serial change, after previously failing to contact the primary.</p></li><li><p>Expire - The maximum number of seconds that a Secondary DNS server can serve stale information, in the event the primary cannot be contacted.</p></li><li><p>Minimum TTL - Per <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2308\">RFC 2308</a>, the number of seconds that a DNS negative response should be cached for.</p></li></ol><p>Using the above information, the Secondary DNS server stores an SOA record for each of the zones it is tracking. When the serial increases, it knows that the zone must have changed, and that a zone transfer must be initiated.  </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"serial-tracking\">Serial Tracking</h2>\n      <a href=\"#serial-tracking\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Serial increases can be detected in the following ways:</p><ol><li><p>The fastest way for the Secondary DNS server to keep track of a serial change is to have the primary server NOTIFY them any time a zone has changed using the DNS protocol as specified in <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1996.txt\">RFC 1996</a>, Secondary DNS servers will instantly be able to initiate a zone transfer.</p></li><li><p>Another way is for the Secondary DNS server to simply poll the primary every “Refresh” seconds. This isn’t as fast as the NOTIFY approach, but it is a good fallback in case the notifies have failed.</p></li></ol><p>One of the issues with the basic NOTIFY protocol is that anyone on the Internet could potentially notify the Secondary DNS server of a zone update. If an initial SOA query is not performed by the Secondary DNS server before initiating a zone transfer, this is an easy way to perform an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/\">amplification attack</a>. There is two common ways to prevent anyone on the Internet from being able to NOTIFY Secondary DNS servers:</p><ol><li><p>Using transaction signatures (TSIG) as per <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2845\">RFC 2845</a>. These are to be placed as the last record in the extra records section of the DNS message. Usually the number of extra records (or ARCOUNT) should be no more than two in this case.</p></li><li><p>Using IP based access control lists (ACL). This increases security but also prevents flexibility in server location and IP address allocation.</p></li></ol><p>Generally NOTIFY messages are sent over UDP, however TCP can be used in the event the primary server has reason to believe that TCP is necessary (i.e. firewall issues).</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"zone-transfers\">Zone Transfers</h2>\n      <a href=\"#zone-transfers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In addition to serial tracking, it is important to ensure that a standard protocol is used between primary and Secondary DNS server(s), to efficiently transfer the zone.

Unlike the AXFR protocol, during an IXFR, the primary server will only send the secondary server the records that have changed since its current version of the zone (based on the serial number). This means that when a Secondary DNS server wants to initiate an IXFR, it sends its current serial number to the primary DNS server. The primary DNS server will then format its response based on previous versions of changes made to the zone. IXFR messages must obey the following pattern:</p><ol><li><p><b><i>Current latest SOA</i></b></p></li><li><p><b><i>Secondary server current SOA</i></b></p></li><li><p><b><i>DNS record deletions</i></b></p></li><li><p><b><i>Secondary server current SOA + changes</i></b></p></li><li><p><b><i>DNS record additions</i></b></p></li><li><p><b><i>Current latest SOA</i></b></p></li></ol><p>Steps 2,3,4,5,6 can be repeated any number of times, as each of those represents one change set of deletions and additions, ultimately leading to a new serial.</p><p>IXFR can be done over UDP or TCP, but again TCP is generally recommended to avoid packet loss.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-does-secondary-dns-work-at-cloudflare\">How Does Secondary DNS Work at Cloudflare?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-does-secondary-dns-work-at-cloudflare\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The DNS team loves microservice architecture!

The following services were created:</p><ol><li><p>Zone Transferer - responsible for attempting IXFR, followed by AXFR if IXFR fails.</p></li><li><p>Zone Transfer Scheduler - responsible for periodically checking zone SOA serials for changes.</p></li><li><p>Rest API - responsible for registering new zones and primary nameservers.</p></li></ol><p>In addition to the marathon apps, we also had an app external to the cluster:</p><ol><li><p>Notify Listener - responsible for listening for notifies from primary servers and telling the Zone Transferer to initiate an AXFR/IXFR.</p></li></ol><p>Each of these microservices communicates with the others through <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\">Kafka</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6cS9HY6kpiqdrdyD3tqQjI/55d2a781d351cc854f416dd9b1e7d4f3/image8-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"776\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Figure 1: Secondary DNS Microservice Architecture‌‌</p><p>Once the zone transferer completes the AXFR/IXFR, it then passes the zone through to our zone builder, and finally gets pushed out to our edge at each of our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">200 locations.</a></p><p>Although this current architecture worked great in the beginning, it left us open to many vulnerabilities and scalability issues down the road. As our Secondary DNS product became more popular, it was important that we proactively scaled and reduced the technical debt as much as possible. As with many companies in the industry, Cloudflare has recently migrated all of our core data center services to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/\">Kubernetes</a>, moving away from individually managed apps and Marathon clusters.</p><p>What this meant for Secondary DNS is that all of our Marathon-based services, as well as our NOTIFY Listener, had to be migrated to Kubernetes.

There is no benefit in having a large backlog of zone transfers for the same zone. Once a zone has been transferred, assuming no more changes, it does not need to be transferred again. This means that we should only have at most one transfer ongoing, and one scheduled transfer at the same time, for any zone.</p><p>If we want to limit our number of scheduled messages to one per zone, this involves ignoring Kafka messages that get sent to the Zone Transferer. This is not as simple as ignoring specific messages in any random order. One of the benefits of Kafka is that it holds on to messages until the user actually decides to acknowledge them, by committing that messages offset. Since Kafka is just a queue of messages, it has no concept of order other than first in first out (FIFO). If a user is capable of reading from the Kafka topic concurrently, it is entirely possible that a message in the middle of the queue be committed before a message at the end of the queue.</p><p>Most of the time this isn’t an issue, because we know that one of the concurrent readers has read the message from the end of the queue and is processing it. There is one Kubernetes-related catch to this issue, though: pods are ephemeral. The kube master doesn’t care what your concurrent reader is doing, it will kill the pod and it’s up to your application to handle it.</p><p>Consider the following problem:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2LbPUGXSdf0uzNeI68U06Q/13295276ff697029d06c58b2e4a9df81/image2-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1483\" height=\"486\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Figure 5: Kafka Partition‌‌</p><ol><li><p>Read offset 1.

Commit offset 2, essentially also marking offset 1.</p></li><li><p>Restart pod.</p></li><li><p>Read offset 3 Start transferring zone 3.</p></li></ol><p>If these events happen, zone 1 will never be transferred. It is important that zones stay up to date with the primary servers, otherwise stale data will be served from the Secondary DNS server. The solution to this problem involves the use of a list to track which messages have been read and completely processed. In this case, when a zone transfer has finished, it does not necessarily mean that the kafka message should be immediately committed. The solution is as follows:</p><ol><li><p>Keep a list of Kafka messages, sorted based on offset.</p></li><li><p>If finished transfer, remove from list:</p></li><li><p>If the message is the oldest in the list, commit the messages offset.</p></li></ol>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1g6Ku6Is2fixeHyiTIoEwC/0bb4026298db401018aefc89b027a717/image9-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1721\" height=\"1999\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Figure 6: Kafka Algorithm to Solve Message Loss</p><p>This solution is essentially soft committing Kafka messages, until we can confidently say that all other messages have been acknowledged.
