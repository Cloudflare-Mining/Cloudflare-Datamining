	<p>Bogotá is the third largest city in South America after <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/parabens-brasil-cloudflares-27th-data-center-now-live">São Paulo</a> (Brazil) and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/lima-peru-cloudflares-29th-data-center">Lima</a> (Peru). <i>Bogotanos</i> affectionately known as <i>Rolos</i> are proud of their city with its rich cultural heritage, and its modern transportation systems (Ciclovias, Transmilenio) despite the heavy traffic. Whether you are visiting the world famous gold museum or savoring the mouthwatering Ajiaco soup, Bogotá has something for everyone, and visitors are always warmly received by the locals.</p>
