At least that&#39;s what I am going to tell myself when I go to bed.</p><p>This made me realize that the benefits of open source go much farther than one can imagine, and you never know where a piece of code may end up. Open sourcing makes sophisticated algorithms and software accessible to individuals and organizations that would not have the resources to develop them on their own, or the money pay for a proprietary solution.</p><p>It also made me wonder exactly what we did to zlib that makes it stand out from other zlib forks.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"recap\">Recap</h3>\n      <a href=\"#recap\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Zlib is a compression library that supports two formats: deflate and gzip. Both formats use the same algorithm also called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE\">DEFLATE</a>, but with different headers and checksum functions. The deflate algorithm is described <a href=\"/improving-compression-with-preset-deflate-dictionary/\">here</a>.</p><p>Both formats are supported by the absolute majority of web browsers, and we at CloudFlare compress all text content on the fly using the gzip format. Moreover DEFLATE is also used by the PNG file format, and our fork of zlib also accelerates our image optimization engine <a href=\"/introducing-polish-automatic-image-optimizati/\">Polish</a>. You can find the optimized fork of pngcrush <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/pngcrush\">here</a>.</p><p>Given the amount of traffic we must handle, compression optimization really makes sense for us. Therefore we included several improvements over the default implementation.</p><p>First of all it is important to understand the current state of zlib. It is a very old library, one of the oldest that is still used as is to this day. It is so old it was written in K&amp;R C. It is so old USB was not invented yet. It is so old that DOS was still a thing. It is so old (insert your favorite so old joke here). More precisely it dates back to 1995. Back to the days 16-bit computers with 64KB addressable space were still in use.</p><p>Still it represents one of the best pieces of code ever written, and even modernizing it gives only modest performance boost. Which shows the great skill of its authors and the long way compilers have come since 1995.</p><p>Below is a list of some of the improvements in our fork of zlib. This work was done by me, my colleague Shuxin Yang, and also includes improvements from other sources.</p><ul><li><p><code>uint64_t</code> as the standard type - the default fork used 16-bit types.</p></li><li><p>Using an improved hash function - we use the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3385\">iSCSI CRC32</a> function as the hash function in our zlib. This specific function is implemented as a hardware instruction on Intel processors. It has very fast performance and better collision properties.</p></li><li><p>Search for matches of at least 4 bytes, instead the 3 bytes the format suggests. This leads to fewer hash collisions, and less effort wasted on insignificant matches. It also improves the compression rate a little bit for the majority of cases (but not all).</p></li><li><p>Using SIMD instructions for window rolling.</p></li><li><p>Using the hardware carry-less multiplication instruction <code>PLCMULQDQ</code> for the CRC32 checksum.</p></li><li><p>Optimized longest-match function. This is the most performance demanding function in the library. It is responsible for finding the (length, distance) matches in the current window.</p></li></ul><p>In addition, we have an experimental branch that implements an improved version of the linked list used in zlib. It has much better performance for compression levels 6 to 9, while retaining the same compression ratio. You can find the experimental branch <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/zlib/tree/experimental\">here</a>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"benchmarking\">Benchmarking</h3>\n      <a href=\"#benchmarking\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>You can find independent benchmarks of our library <a href=\"https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2015-06-05-updated-zlib-benchmarks/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.htslib.org/benchmarks/zlib.html\">here</a>.
