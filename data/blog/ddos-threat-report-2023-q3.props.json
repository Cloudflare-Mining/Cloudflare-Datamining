DDoS attacks, or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\">distributed denial-of-service attacks</a>, are a type of cyber attack that aims to disrupt websites (and other types of Internet properties) to make them unavailable for legitimate users by overwhelming them with more traffic than they can handle — similar to a driver stuck in a traffic jam on the way to the grocery store.</p><p>We see a lot of DDoS attacks of all types and sizes, and our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">network</a> is one of the largest in the world spanning more than 300 cities in over 100 countries. Through this network we serve over 64 million HTTP requests per second at peak and about 2.3 billion DNS queries every day. On average, we mitigate 140 billion cyber threats each day. This colossal amount of data gives us a unique vantage point to understand the threat landscape and provide the community access to insightful and actionable DDoS trends.</p><p>In recent weeks, we&#39;ve also observed a surge in DDoS attacks and other cyber attacks against Israeli newspaper and media websites, as well as financial institutions and government websites. Palestinian websites have also seen a significant increase in DDoS attacks.

So while it’s interesting to understand the total amount of attack traffic originating from or targeting a given country, it is also helpful to remove that bias by normalizing the attack traffic by all traffic to a given country.</p><p>When doing so, we see a different pattern. The US doesn’t even make it into the top ten. Instead, Mozambique is in first place (again). One out of every five HTTP requests that originated from Mozambique was part of an HTTP DDoS attack traffic.</p><p>Egypt remains in second place — approximately 13% of requests originating from Egypt were part of an HTTP DDoS attack.

These tend to be very volatile as threat actors try to <i>“reduce, reuse and recycle”</i> older attack vectors. These tend to be UDP-based protocols that can be exploited to launch amplification and reflection DDoS attacks.</p><p>One well-known tactic that we continue to see is the use of amplification/reflection attacks. In this attack method, the attacker bounces traffic off of servers, and aims the responses towards their victim. Attackers are able to aim the bounced traffic to their victim by various methods such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing/\">IP spoofing</a>.</p><p>Another form of reflection can be achieved differently in an attack named ‘DNS Laundering attack’. In a DNS Laundering attack, the attacker will query subdomains of a domain that is managed by the victim’s DNS server. The prefix that defines the subdomain is randomized and is never used more than once or twice in such an attack. Due to the randomization element, recursive DNS servers will never have a cached response and will need to forward the query to the victim’s authoritative DNS server. The authoritative DNS server is then bombarded by so many queries until it cannot serve legitimate queries or even crashes all together.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7sMVuA99lvODrsKQNBXFqs/e67a7b2cc1c7f07ba0642b25768a7142/pasted-image-0--20-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"889\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Illustration of a reflection and amplification attack</p><p>Overall in Q3, Multicast DNS (mDNS) based DDoS attacks was the attack method that increased the most.

Approximately 8% of respondents reported being threatened or subject to Random DDoS attacks, which continues a decline we&#39;ve been tracking throughout the year.
