You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism.</p><p>One solution would be to <b>render your site statically</b> and cache it at the edge. This would help ensure you have top-notch delivery speed because you don’t need a server to return a response. However, your site has decades worth of content. If you wanted to make even a small change to the site design, you would need to regenerate <i>every single page</i> during your next deploy. This would take ages.</p><p>Another issue is that your site would be static — and future updates to content or new articles would not be available until you deploy again.</p><p>That’s not going to work.</p><p>Another solution would be to <b>render each page dynamically</b> on your server. This ensures you can return a dynamic response for new or updated articles.</p><p>However, you’re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner. You’ll also probably need to implement a system of internal caches to optimize the performance of your app, which could lead to a more complicated development experience. That also means you’ll be at risk of a thundering herd problem if, for any reason, your cache becomes invalidated.</p><p>Neither of these solutions are great, and you’re forced to <b>make a tradeoff</b> between one of these two approaches.</p><p>Thankfully, you’ve recently come across a project like <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a> which offers a hybrid approach: static-site generation along with incremental regeneration. You’re in love with the patterns and developer experience in Next.js, but you’d also love to take advantage of the Cloudflare Workers platform to host your site.</p><p><a href=\"https://workers.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Workers</a> allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter — reducing the number of network trips required to load your application. In a perfect world, we wouldn’t need to find hosting for a Next.js site, because Cloudflare offers the same JavaScript hosting functionality with the Workers platform. With their dynamic runtime and edge caching capabilities, we wouldn’t need to worry about making a tradeoff between static and dynamic for our site.</p><p>Unfortunately, frameworks like Next.js and Cloudflare Workers don’t mesh together particularly well due to technical constraints. Until now:</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"im-excited-to-announce-a-new-open-source-react-framework-built-for-cloudflare-workers\">I’m excited to announce <a href=\"https://flareact.com\">Flareact</a>, a new open-source React framework built for Cloudflare Workers.</h4>\n      <a href=\"#im-excited-to-announce-a-new-open-source-react-framework-built-for-cloudflare-workers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5iZAEv0uTQCFMSWABs8KLe/3ed9b1c1f576ae5498c03b58a41d6e3b/Flareact_2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"916\" height=\"214\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>With Flareact, you don’t need to make the tradeoff between a static site and a dynamic application.</p><p>Flareact allows you to <b>render your React apps at the edge</b> rather than on the server.

This allows you to provide an initial server response with HTML markup — which can be helpful for search engine crawlers. You can also cache the response at the edge and optionally invalidate that cache on a timed basis — meaning your static markup will be regenerated if you need it to be fresh.</p><p>This isn’t a new pattern: Next.js has done the hard work in defining the shape of this API with <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#next-gen-static-site-generation-ssg-support\">SSG support</a> and <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-5#stable-incremental-static-regeneration\">Incremental Static Regeneration</a>.

However, Next.js and its APIs are framed around the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html\">Node.js HTTP Server API</a>, while Cloudflare Workers use <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works\">V8 isolates</a> and are modeled after the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event\">FetchEvent type</a>.</p><p>Since we don’t have typical access to a filesystem inside V8 isolates, it’s tough to mimic the environment required to run a dynamic Next.js server at the edge. Though projects like <a href=\"https://fab.dev\">Fab</a> have come up with workarounds, I decided to approach the project with a clean slate and use existing patterns established in Next.js in a brand-new framework.</p><p>As a developer, I absolutely love the simplicity of exporting an asynchronous function from my page to have it supply props to the component. Flareact implements this pattern by allowing you to export a <code>getEdgeProps</code> function. This is similar to <code>getStaticProps</code> in Next.js, and it matches the expected return shape of that function in Next.js — including a <code>revalidate</code> parameter. <a href=\"https://flareact.com/docs/data-fetching\">Learn more about data fetching in Flareact</a>.</p><p>I was also inspired by the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction\">API Routes feature of Next.js</a> when I implemented the <a href=\"https://flareact.com/docs/api-routes\">API Routes feature of Flareact</a> — enabling you to write standard Cloudflare Worker scripts directly within your React app.</p><p>I hope porting over an existing Next.js project to Flareact is a breeze!</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-it-works\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>When a <code>FetchEvent</code> request comes in, Flareact inspects the URL pathname to decide how to handle it:</p><p>If the request is for a <b>page</b> or for <b>page props</b>, it checks the cache for that request and returns it if there’s a hit.

With lots of interesting stuff going on behind the scenes to support SSR and client-side routing events, I decided to make <a href=\"https://flareact.com/docs/flareact-head\">flareact/head</a> a simple wrapper around <a href=\"https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet\">react-helmet</a> instead:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">import Head from &quot;flareact/head&quot;;\n\nexport default function Index() {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;Head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;My page title&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;/Head&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world.&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</pre></code>\n            \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"local-development\">Local Development</h3>\n      <a href=\"#local-development\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The local developer experience of Flareact leverages the new <code>wrangler dev</code> command, sending server requests through a local tunnel to the Cloudflare edge and back to your machine.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><stream src=\"f93e42e0ffd5e4cd7c17f08f2ab0226b\" controls></stream>\n<script data-cfasync=\"false\" defer type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://embed.videodelivery.net/embed/r4xu.fla9.latest.js?video=f93e42e0ffd5e4cd7c17f08f2ab0226b\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This is a huge win for productivity, since you don’t need to manually build and deploy your application to see how it will perform in a production environment.</p><p>It’s also a really exciting update to the serverless toolchain.
