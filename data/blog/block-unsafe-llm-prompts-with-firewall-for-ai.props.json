From chatbots to search assistants, LLMs are already shaping customer experience, but they also open the door to new risks. A single malicious prompt can exfiltrate sensitive data, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/data-poisoning/\"><u>poison a model</u></a>, or inject toxic content into customer-facing interactions, undermining user trust. Without guardrails, even the best-trained model can be turned against the business.</p><p>Today, as part of AI Week, we’re expanding our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ai-security/\">AI security offerings</a> by introducing unsafe content moderation, now integrated directly into Cloudflare <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/firewall-for-ai/\"><u>Firewall for AI</u></a>.

Now with just a few clicks, security and application teams can detect and block harmful prompts or topics at the edge — eliminating the need to modify application code or infrastructure.\n\nThis feature is immediately available to current Firewall for AI users.

It also extends protection to other risks such as unsafe or harmful content.</p><p>Unlike built-in controls that vary between model providers, Firewall for AI is model-agnostic. It sits in front of any model you choose, whether it’s from a third party like OpenAI or Gemini, one you run in-house, or a custom model you have built, and applies the same consistent protections.</p><p>Just like our origin-agnostic <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/#application-services-case-products\"><u>Application Security suite</u></a>, Firewall for AI enforces policies at scale across all your models, creating a unified security layer. That means you can define guardrails once and apply them everywhere.

This flexibility enables rich user experiences but also opens the door to abuse.</p><p>Key risks from unsafe prompts include misinformation, biased or offensive content, and model poisoning, where repeated harmful prompts degrade the quality and safety of future outputs. Blocking these prompts aligns with the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, preventing both immediate misuse and long-term degradation.</p><p>One example of this is<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist\"> <b><u>Microsoft’s Tay chatbot</u></b></a>.

If detection is too broad, it can prevent a model from answering legitimate user questions, hurting its utility. This is especially difficult for topic detection because of the ambiguity and dynamic nature of human language, where context is fundamental to meaning. </p><p>Simple approaches like keyword blocklists are interesting for precise subjects — but insufficient. They are easily bypassed and fail to understand the context in which words are used, leading to poor recall. Older probabilistic models such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation\"><u>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)</u></a> were an improvement, but did not properly account for word ordering and other contextual nuances. \n\nRecent advancements in LLMs introduced a new paradigm. Their ability to perform zero-shot or few-shot classification is uniquely suited for the task of topic detection. For this reason, we chose <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B\"><u>Llama Guard 3</u></a>, an open-source model based on the Llama architecture that is specifically fine-tuned for content safety classification. When it analyzes a prompt, it answers whether the text is safe or unsafe, and provides a specific category. We are showing the default categories, as listed <a href=\"http://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.llm.prompt.unsafe_topic_categories/\"><u>here</u></a>. Because Llama 3 has a fixed knowledge cutoff, certain categories — like defamation or elections — are time-sensitive. As a result, the model may not fully capture events or context that emerged after it was trained, and that’s important to keep in mind when relying on it.</p><p>For now, we cover the 13 default categories. We plan to expand coverage in the future, leveraging the model’s zero-shot capabilities.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"a-scalable-architecture-for-future-detections\">A scalable architecture for future detections</h3>\n      <a href=\"#a-scalable-architecture-for-future-detections\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We designed Firewall for AI to scale without adding noticeable latency, including Llama Guard, and this remains true even as we add new detection models.</p><p>To achieve this, we built a new asynchronous architecture.

This infrastructure ensures we can offer fast, reliable inference throughout our network.</p><p>To ensure the system remains fast and reliable as adoption grows, we ran extensive load tests simulating the requests per second (RPS) we anticipate, using a wide range of prompt sizes to prepare for real-world traffic. To handle this, the number of model instances deployed on our network scales automatically with the load. We employ concurrency to minimize latency and optimize for hardware utilization. We also enforce a hard 2-second threshold for each analysis; if this time limit is reached, we fall back to any detections already completed, ensuring your application&#39;s requests latency is never further impacted.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"from-detection-to-security-rules-enforcement\">From detection to security rules enforcement</h3>\n      <a href=\"#from-detection-to-security-rules-enforcement\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Firewall for AI follows the same familiar pattern as other Application Security features like Bot Management and WAF Attack Score, making it easy to adopt.</p><p>Once enabled, the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/firewall-for-ai/#fields\"><u>new fields</u></a> appear in <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/\"><u>Security Analytics</u></a> and expanded logs.

We are also exploring how to add more visibility in the analytics and logs, so teams can better validate detection results. A major part of our roadmap is adding model response handling, giving you control over not only what goes into the LLM but also what comes out. Additional abuse controls, such as rate limiting on tokens and support for more safety categories, are also on the way.</p><p>Firewall for AI is available in beta today.
