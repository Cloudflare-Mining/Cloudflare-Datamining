Not just because <a href=\"/introducing-cryptographic-attestation-of-personhood/\">humanity wastes 500 years per day</a> on solving other people&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-machine-learning/\">machine learning</a> problems, but because we are dedicated to making an Internet that is fast, transparent, and private for everyone. CAPTCHAs are not very human-friendly, being hard to solve for even the most dedicated Internet users. They are extremely difficult to solve for people who don’t speak certain languages, and people who are on mobile devices (which is most users!).</p><p>Today, we are taking another step in helping to reduce the Internet’s reliance on CAPTCHAs to prove that you are not a robot. We are expanding the reach of our Cryptographic Attestation of Personhood experiment by adding support for a much wider range of devices. This includes biometric authenticators — like Apple&#39;s Face ID, Microsoft Hello, and Android Biometric Authentication. This will let you solve challenges in under five seconds with just a touch of your finger or a view of your face -- without sending this private biometric data to anyone.</p><p>You can try it out on our demo site <a href=\"https://cloudflarechallenge.com/\">cloudflarechallenge.com</a> and let us know your feedback.</p><p>In addition to support for hardware biometric authenticators, we are also announcing support for many more hardware tokens today in the Cryptographic Attestation of Personhood experiment. We support all USB and NFC keys that are both certified by the FIDO alliance and have no known security issues according to the FIDO Alliance Metadata service (<a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/\">MDS 3.0</a>).</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"privacy-first\">Privacy First</h2>\n            <a href=\"#privacy-first\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Privacy is at the center of Cryptographic Attestation of Personhood. Information about your biometric data is never shared with, transmitted to, or processed by Cloudflare. We simply never see it, at all.

The existing assurances are already quite strong: as described in our previous post, when using CAP, you may disclose a small amount of information about your authentication hardware -- at most, its make and model. By design, this information is not unique to you: the underlying standard requires that this be indistinguishable from thousands of others, which hides you in a crowd of identical hardware.</p><p>Even though this is a great start, we wanted to see if we could push things even farther. Could we learn just the one fact that we need -- that you have a valid security key -- without learning anything else?</p><p>We are excited to announce that we have made great strides on answering that question by using a form of the next generation of cryptography called Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). ZKP prevents us from discovering anything from you, other than the fact that you have a device that can generate an approved certificate that proves that you are human.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about Zero Knowledge Proofs, we highly recommend reading about it <a href=\"/introducing-zero-knowledge-proofs-for-private-web-attestation-with-cross-multi-vendor-hardware/\">here</a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"driven-by-speed-ease-of-use-and-bot-defense\">Driven by Speed, Ease of Use, and Bot Defense</h2>\n            <a href=\"#driven-by-speed-ease-of-use-and-bot-defense\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>At the start of this project we set out three goals:</p><ol><li><p>How can we dramatically improve the user experience of proving that you are a human?</p></li><li><p>How can we make sure that any solution that we develop centers around ease of use, and increases global accessibility on the Internet?</p></li><li><p>How do we make a solution that does not harm our existing bot management system?</p></li></ol><p>Before we deployed this new evolution of our CAPTCHA solution, we did a proof of concept test with some real users, to confirm whether this approach was worth pursuing (just because something sounds great in theory doesn’t mean it will work out in practice!). Our testing group tried our Cryptographic Attestation of Personhood solution using Face ID and told us what they thought. We learned that solving times with Face ID and Touch ID were significantly faster than selecting pictures, with almost no errors. People vastly preferred this alternative, and provided suggestions for improvements in the user experience that we incorporated into our deployment.</p><p>This was even more evident in our production usage data. While we did not enable attestation with biometrics providers during our first phase of the CAP roll out, we did record when people attempted to use a biometric authentication service. The highest recorded attempt solve rate besides YubiKeys was Face ID on iOS, and Android Biometric Authentication. We are excited to offer those mobile users their first choice of challenge for proving their humanity.</p><p>One of the things we heard about in testing was — not surprisingly — concerns around privacy. As we explained in our <a href=\"/introducing-cryptographic-attestation-of-personhood/\">initial launch</a>, the WebAuthn technology underpinning our solution provides a high level of privacy protection. Cloudflare is able to view an identifier shared by thousands of similar devices, which provides general make and model information. This cannot be used to uniquely identify or track you — and that’s exactly how we like it.</p><p>Now that we have opened up our solution to more device types, you’re able to use biometric readers as well. Rest assured that the same privacy protections apply — we never see your biometric data: that remains on your device. Once your device confirms a match, it sends only a basic attestation message, just as it would for any security key. In effect, your device sends a message proving that “yes, someone correctly entered a fingerprint on this trustworthy device”, and never sends the fingerprint itself.</p><p>We have also been reviewing feedback from people who have been testing out CAP on either our demo site or through routine browsing. We appreciate the helpful comments you’ve been sending, and we’d love to hear more, so we can continue to make improvements. We’ve set up a survey at our <a href=\"http://cloudflarechallenge.com\">demo site</a>. Your input is key to ensuring that we get usability right, so please let us know what you think.</p>",
