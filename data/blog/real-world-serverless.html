	<p>I work in Developer Relations at Cloudflare and I'm fortunate to have top-notch developers around me who are willing to share their knowledge with the greater developer community. I produced a series of events this autumn called Real World Serverless at multiple locations around the world and I want to share the recorded videos from these events.</p>
	<p>Our Austin Real World Serverless event (in partnership with the<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ATX-Serverless/" target="_blank"> ATX Serverless User Group Meetup</a>) included two talks about Serverless technology featuring<a href="https://twitter.com/Miss_Vee22" target="_blank"> Victoria Bernard</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/preston-pham-92715938/" target="_blank">Preston Pham</a> from Cloudflare. They spoke about working out backend knots with<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/" target="_blank"> Workers</a> and building a router for the great good.</p>

	<p><strong>Working out Backend Knots with Workers - Victoria Bernard (0:00-15:19)</strong></p>
	<p>Cloudflare Workers is a platform the makes serverless development and deployment easier than ever. A worker is a script running between your clients' browsers and your site's origin that can intercept requests. Victoria went over some popular use cases of how proxy workers can dramatically improve a site's performance and add functionality that would normally require toying with complicated back-end services.</p>
	<p><strong>Build a Router for Great Good <strong>- Preston Pham (15:20-33:53)</strong></strong></p>
	<p>Serverless computing is great, but requires routing or some kind of API gateway. Preston built a simple JavaScript routing library for serverless Worker scripts and explained how you can do this too. He built a router from the ground up, similar to other web application frameworks like flask or express.js.</p>
