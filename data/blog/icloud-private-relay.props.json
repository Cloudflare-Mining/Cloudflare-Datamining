Private Relay is designed to preserve IP address to geolocation mapping accuracy, even while preventing tracking and fingerprinting.</p><p>Preserving the ability to derive rough user location ensures that users with Private Relay enabled are able to:</p><ol><li><p>See place search and other locally relevant content when they interact with geography-specific content without precise location sharing enabled.</p></li><li><p>Consume content subject to licensing restrictions limiting which regions have access to it (e.g. live sports broadcasts and similar rights-restricted content).</p></li></ol><p>One of the key “acceptance tests” we think about when thinking about geolocating users is the “local pizza test”: with location services disabled, are the results returned for the search term “pizza near me” geographically relevant? Because of the geography preserving and IP address management systems we operate, they are!</p><p>At a high-level, here’s how it works:</p><ul><li><p>Apple relays geolocate user IP addresses and translate them into a “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash\">geohash</a>”. Geohashes are compact representations of latitude and longitude. The system includes protections to ensure geohashes cannot be spoofed by clients, and operates with reduced precision to ensure user privacy is maintained. Apple relays do not send user IP addresses onward.</p></li><li><p>Cloudflare relays maintain a pool of IP addresses for exclusive use by Private Relay. These IP addresses have been registered with geolocation database providers to correspond to specific cities around the world. When a Private Relay user connects and presents the previously determined geohash, the closest matching IP address is selected.</p></li><li><p>Servers see an IP address that corresponds to the original user IP address’s location, without obtaining information that may be used to identify the specific user.</p></li></ul><p>In most parts of the world, Private Relay supports geolocation to the nearest city by default. If users prefer to be located at more coarse location granularity, the option to locate based on country and timezone is available in Private Relay settings.</p><p>If your website relies on geolocation of client IP addresses to power or modify user experiences, <b>please ensure your geolocation database is kept up to date</b>. Apple and Cloudflare work directly with every major IP to geolocation provider to ensure they have an accurate mapping of Private Relay egress IP addresses (which present to your server as the client IP address) to geography. These mappings may change from time to time. Using the most up-to-date version of your provider’s database will ensure the most accurate geolocation results for all users, including those using Private Relay.</p><p>In addition to making sure your geolocation databases are up-to-date, even greater location accuracy and precision can be obtained by ensuring your origin is reachable via IPv6. Private Relay egress nodes prefer IPv6 whenever AAAA DNS records are available, and use IPv6 egress IP addresses that are geolocated with greater precision than their IPv4 equivalents. This means you can geolocate users to more specific locations (without compromising user privacy) and deliver more relevant content to users as a result.</p><p><b>If you’re a website operator using Cloudflare to protect and accelerate your site, no action is needed from you</b>. Our geolocation feeds used to enrich client requests with location metadata are kept up-to-date and include the information needed to geolocate users using iCloud Private Relay.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"delivering-high-performance-user-experiences\">Delivering high performance user experiences</h3>\n      <a href=\"#delivering-high-performance-user-experiences\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>One of the more counterintuitive things about performance on the Internet is that adding intermediate network “hops” between a user and a server can often <b><i>speed up</i></b> overall network performance, rather than slow it down, if those intermediate hops are well-connected and tuned for speed.</p><p>The networks that power iCloud Private Relay are exceptionally well-connected to other networks around the world, and we spend <a href=\"/tag/network-performance-update/\">considerable effort</a> squeezing every last ounce of performance out of our systems every day.
