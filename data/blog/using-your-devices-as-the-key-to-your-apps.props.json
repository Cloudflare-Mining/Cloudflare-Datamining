I manually input every expense into a spreadsheet app and use a combination of <code>sumifs</code> functions to track spending.</p><p>Opening the spreadsheet app, and then the specific spreadsheet, every time that I want to submit an expense is a little clunky. I&#39;m working on a new project to make that easier. I&#39;m building a simple web app, with a very basic form, into which I will enter one-off expenses. This form will then append those expenses as rows into the budget workbook.</p><p>I want to lock down this project; I prefer that I am the only person with the power to wreck my budget. To do that, I&#39;m going to use <a href=\"https://teams.cloudflare.com/access/index.html\">Cloudflare Access</a>. With Access, I can require a login to reach the page - no server-side changes required.</p><p>Except, I don&#39;t want to allow logins from any device. For this project, I want to turn my iPhone into the only device that can reach this app.</p><p>To do that, I&#39;ll use Cloudflare Access in combination with an open source toolkit from Cloudflare, <code>cfssl</code>. Together, I can convert my device into a secure key for this application in about 45 minutes.</p><p>While this is just one phone and a simple project, a larger organization could scale this up to hundreds of thousands or millions - without spending 45 minutes per device. Authentication occurs in the Cloudflare network and lets teams focus on securely deploying devices, from IoT sensors to corporate laptops, that solve new problems.</p><p><b>? I have a few goals for this project:</b></p><ul><li><p>Protect my prototype budget-entry app with authentication</p></li><li><p>Avoid building a custom login flow into the app itself</p></li><li><p>Use mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication so that only requests from my iPhone are allowed</p></li></ul><p><b>?️ This walkthrough covers how to:</b></p><ul><li><p>Build an Access policy to enforce mutual TLS authentication</p></li><li><p>Use Cloudflare&#39;s PKI toolkit to create a Root CA and then generate a client certificate</p></li><li><p>Use OpenSSL to convert that client certificate into a format for iPhone usage</p></li><li><p>Place that client certificate on my iPhone</p></li></ul><p><b>⏲️Time to complete: ~45 minutes</b></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"cloudflare-access\">Cloudflare Access</h2>\n            <a href=\"#cloudflare-access\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p><a href=\"https://teams.cloudflare.com/access/index.html\">Cloudflare Access</a> is a bouncer that checks ID at the door. Any and every door.</p><p>Old models of security built on private networks operate like a guard at the front door of a large apartment building, except this apartment building does not have locks on any of the individual units. If you can walk through the front door, you could walk into any home. By default, private networks assume that a user on that network is trusted until proven malicious - you&#39;re free to roam the building until someone reports you. None of us want to live in that complex.</p><p>Access replaces that model with a bouncer in front of each apartment unit. Cloudflare checks every attempt to reach a protected app, machine, or remote desktop against rules that define who is allowed in.</p><p>To perform that check, Access needs to confirm a user&#39;s identity. To do that, teams can integrate Access with identity providers like G Suite, AzureAD, Okta or even Facebook and GitHub.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3uaC7WZ67qVTXZV1wsG10t/e140d5a12eb8645f34e5e0e934669f75/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1334\" height=\"844\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>For this project, I want to limit not just <b>who</b> can reach the app, but also <b>what</b> can reach it.

This root will give Access a basis for trusting client certificates. Think of the root as the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in Texas. Only the State of Texas, through the DMV, can issue Texas driver licenses. Bouncers do not need to know about every driver license issued, but they do know to trust the State of Texas and how to validate Texas-issued licenses.</p><p>In this case, Access does not need to know about every client cert issued by this Root CA. The product only needs to know to trust this Root CA and how to validate if client certificates were issued by this root.</p><p>I&#39;m going to start by creating a new directory, <code>cert-auth</code> to keep things organized. Inside of that directory, I&#39;ll create a folder, <code>root</code>, where I&#39;ll store the Root CA materials</p><p>Next, I&#39;ll define some details about the Root CA. I&#39;ll create a file, <code>ca-csr.json</code> and give it some specifics that relate to my deployment.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\">{\n    &quot;CN&quot;: &quot;Sam Money App&quot;,\n    &quot;key&quot;: {\n      &quot;algo&quot;: &quot;rsa&quot;,\n      &quot;size&quot;: 4096\n    },\n    &quot;names&quot;: [\n      {\n        &quot;C&quot;: &quot;PT&quot;,\n        &quot;L&quot;: &quot;Lisboa&quot;,\n        &quot;O&quot;: &quot;Money App Test&quot;,\n        &quot;OU&quot;: &quot;Sam Projects&quot;,\n        &quot;ST&quot;: &quot;Lisboa&quot;\n      }\n    ]\n  }</pre></code>\n            <p>Now I need to configure how the CA will be used. I&#39;ll create another new file, <code>ca-config.json</code>, and add the following details.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\">{\n    &quot;signing&quot;: {\n      &quot;default&quot;: {\n        &quot;expiry&quot;: &quot;8760h&quot;\n      },\n      &quot;profiles&quot;: {\n        &quot;server&quot;: {\n          &quot;usages&quot;: [&quot;signing&quot;, &quot;key encipherment&quot;, &quot;server auth&quot;],\n          &quot;expiry&quot;: &quot;8760h&quot;\n        },\n        &quot;client&quot;: {\n          &quot;usages&quot;: [&quot;signing&quot;,&quot;key encipherment&quot;,&quot;client auth&quot;],\n          &quot;expiry&quot;: &quot;8760h&quot;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }</pre></code>\n            <p>The <code>ca-csr.json</code> file gives the Root CA a sense of identity and the <code>ca-config.json</code> will later define the configuration details when signing new client certificates.</p><p>With that in place, I can go ahead and create the Root CA. I&#39;ll run the following command in my terminal from within the <code>root</code> folder.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cfssl genkey -initca ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare ca</pre></code>\n            <p>The “Root CA” here is really a composition of three files, all of which are created by that command. <code>cfssl</code> generates a private key, a certificate signing request, and the certificate itself. The output should resemble this screenshot:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2Qmo84Y4hqJYdZmzRyXIVm/8deaea622d8ae4d78dc098abbd23e9bb/root-output-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"464\" height=\"316\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>I need to guard the private key like it&#39;s the only thing that matters. In real production deployments, most organizations will create an intermediate certificate and sign client certificates with that intermediate. This allows administrators to keep the root locked down even further, they only need to handle it when creating new intermediates (and those intermediates can be quickly revoked). For this test, I&#39;m just going to use a root to create the client certificates.</p><p>Now that I have the Root CA, I can upload the certificate in PEM format to Cloudflare Access. Cloudflare can then use that certificate to authenticate incoming requests for a valid client certificate.</p><p>In the Cloudflare Access dashboard, I&#39;ll use the card titled “Mutual TLS Root Certificates”. I can click “Add A New Certificate” and then paste the content of the <code>ca.pem</code> file directly into it.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3AJkIr7XXnZWhGARxwrtzk/71c7e100fd2e0780480aae5f5b63af1e/ca-upload-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1441\" height=\"1265\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>I need to associate this certificate with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

The command below uses the <code>-profile</code> flag to create the client cert using the JSON configuration I just saved. This also gives the file the name <code>iphone-client</code>.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cfssl gencert -ca=../root/ca.pem -ca-key=../root/ca-key.pem -config=../root/ca-config.json -profile=client client-csr.json | cfssljson -bare iphone-client</pre></code>\n            <p>The combined output should resemble the following:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5JwgtLX24Yo9QI7iNU6080/c7e68580c0251c0130e9e80e9d99593a/folder-client-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"512\" height=\"542\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>FileDescription</b><code>client-csr.json</code>The JSON configuration created earlier to specify client cert details.<code>iphone-client-key.pem</code>The private key for the client certificate generated.<code>iphone-client.csr</code>The certificate signing request used to request the client cert.<code>iphone-client.pem</code>The client certificate created.</p><p>With my freshly minted client certificate and key, I can go ahead and test that it works with my Access policy with a quick <code>cURL</code> command.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ curl -v --cert iphone-client.pem --key iphone-client-key.pem https://money.samrhea.com</pre></code>\n            <p>That works, but I&#39;m not done yet. I need to get this client certificate on my iPhone. To do so, I need to convert the certificate and key into a format that my iPhone understands, PKCS #12.</p><p><a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292\">PKCS 12</a> is a file format used for storing cryptographic objects. To convert the two <code>.pem</code> files, the certificate and the key, into PKCS 12, I&#39;m going to use the <a href=\"https://www.openssl.org/\">OpenSSL</a> command-line tool.</p><p>OpenSSL is a popular toolkit for TLS and SSL protocols that can solve a wide variety of certificate use cases. In my example, I just need it for one command:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ openssl pkcs12 -export -out sam-iphone.p12 -inkey iphone-client-key.pem -in iphone-client.pem -certfile ../root/ca.pem</pre></code>\n            <p>The command above takes the key and certificate generated previously and converts them into a single <code>.p12</code> file. I&#39;ll also be prompted to create an “Export Password”. I&#39;ll use something that I can remember, because I&#39;m going to need it in the next section.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5MAG6HR9az3gjZpzAZYXEP/910581f83d12f6439e095ea12d591a71/convert-twelve.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1132\" height=\"268\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"authenticating-from-my-iphone\">Authenticating from my iPhone</h2>\n            <a href=\"#authenticating-from-my-iphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>I now need to get the <code>.p12</code> file on my iPhone.
