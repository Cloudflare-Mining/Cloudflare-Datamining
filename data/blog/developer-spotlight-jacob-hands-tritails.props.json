Today’s post is by Jacob Hands. Jacob operates <a href=\"http://tritailsbeef.com\">TriTails Premium Beef</a>, which is an online store for meat, a very perishable good. So he has a lot of unique challenges when it comes to shipping. To deal with their growth, Jacob, a developer by trade, turned to Airtable and Cloudflare Workers to automate a lot of their workflow.</p><p>One of Jacob’s quotes is one of my favourites:</p><blockquote><p>“Sure, Cloudflare Workers allows you to scale to billions of requests per day, but it is also awesome for a few hundred requests a day.”</p></blockquote><p>Here is Jacob talking about how it only took him a few days to put together a fully customised workflow tool by integrating Airtable and Workers. And how it saves them multiple hours every single day.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"shipping-requirements\">Shipping Requirements</h2>\n            <a href=\"#shipping-requirements\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Working at a new e-commerce business shipping perishable goods has several challenges as operations scale up. One of our biggest challenges is that daily shipping throughput is limited. Partly because of a small workspace, limiting how many employees can simultaneously pack orders, and also because despite having a requested pickup time with UPS, they often show up hours early, requiring packers to stop and scramble to meet them before they leave. Packing is also time-consuming because it’s a game of Tetris getting all products to fit with enough dry ice to keep it frozen.</p><p>This is what a regular box looks like:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2N61FLQM9pesehhiwnTGRx/0502858a965985ef3de5a170dad4a2be/image2-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Ensuring time-in-transit stays as low as possible is critical for ensuring that products stay frozen when arriving at the customer’s doorstep. Because of this requirement, avoiding packages staying in transit during the weekend is a must. We learned that the hard way after a package got delayed by a day, which wouldn’t have been too bad, but that meant it stayed in a sorting centre over the weekend, which wasn’t as pleasant.</p><p>Luckily, we caught it on time, and we were able to send a replacement set of steaks overnight and save a dinner party. But after that, we started triaging our orders to make sure that the correct packages were shipped at the right time.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"order-triage-the-hard-way\">Order Triage, The Hard Way</h2>\n            <a href=\"#order-triage-the-hard-way\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>In the early days, we could pack orders after lunch and be done in an hour, but as we grew we needed to be careful about what, when, and how we ship. First, all open orders were copied to a Google Sheet. Next, the time-in-transit was manually checked for each order and added to the sheet. The sheet was then sorted by transit time (with paid priority air at the top), and each set of orders was separated into groups. Finally, the Google Sheet was printed for the packing team to work through.</p><p>Transit times are so crucial to the shipment process that they need to be on each packing slip so that the packing team knows how much dry ice and packaging each order needs. So the transit times were typed into each packing slip in Adobe Acrobat before printing. While this is a very tedious process, it is vital to ensure that each package is packed according to what they need to arrive in good condition.</p><p>Once the packing team would finish packing orders, the box weights and sizes were added to the Google Sheet based on the worksheet filled out by the packers. Next, each order label was created, individually copying weights and sizes from the Google Sheet to ShipStation, the application we use to manage logistics with our providers. Finally, the packages would be picked up and started their journey to the customer’s doorstep.</p><p>This process worked fine for ten orders, but as operations scaled up, triaging and organizing the orders became a full-time job, checking and double-checking that everything was entered correctly and that no human mistakes occurred (spoiler, they still happened!)</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"automation\">Automation</h2>\n            <a href=\"#automation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>At first, I just wanted to automate the most tedious step: calculating transit times. This process took so long that it hindered how early the packing team could start packing orders, further limiting our throughput. Cloudflare Workers are so easy to use and get running quickly, so they seemed like a great place to start. The plan was to use =IMPORTDATA(order) in Google Sheets and eliminate that step in the process.</p><p>Automating just one thing is powerful, and it opened a flood of ideas about how our workflow could further be improved. With the first 30 minutes of daily work automated, what else could be done? That’s when I set out to automate as much of the workflow as possible, excited about the possibilities.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"triaging-the-triaging\">Triaging the Triaging</h3>\n            <a href=\"#triaging-the-triaging\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Problem-solving is often about figuring out what to prioritize, and automating this workflow is no different. Our order triaging process has many steps, and setting out to automate the entire thing at once wasn’t possible because of the limited blocks of time to work on it. Instead, I decided to only solve the highest priority problems, one step at a time. Triaging the triaging process helped me build everything needed to automate an entire workflow without it ever feeling overwhelming, and gaining efficiency each step along the way.</p><p>With the time-in-transit calculation API working, the next part I automated was getting the orders that need shipping from Shopify via the API instead of copy-pasting every time. This is where the limits of Google Sheets started to become apparent. While automation can be done in Sheets, it can quickly become a black box full of hacks. So it was time to move to a better platform, but which one?</p><p>While I had often heard of Airtable and played with it a few times since it launched in 2012, the pricing and limitations never seemed to fit any of my use cases. But with the little amount of data we needed to store at any one time, it seemed worth trying since it has an easy-to-use API and supports strict cell formats, which is much harder to do in Sheets. Airtable has an intuitive UI, and it is easy to create custom fields for each type of data needed.</p><p>Once I found out Airtable had a built-in <a href=\"https://airtable.com/marketplace/blkQyAKhJoGKqnR0T/scripting\">Scripting app</a>, it was obvious this was the right tool for the job.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"building-airtable-scripting-apps\">Building Airtable Scripting Apps</h2>\n            <a href=\"#building-airtable-scripting-apps\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Airtable Scripting is a powerful tool for building functionality directly within Airtable using JavaScript. Unfortunately, there are some limitations. For example, it isn’t possible to share code between different instances of the Scripting App without copying and pasting. There’s also no source control so reverting changes relies on the Undo button.</p><p>Cloudflare Workers, on the other hand, is a full developer platform. You can easily use source control, and it has a great developer experience with Wrangler and Miniflare, so testing and deploying is fast and seamless.</p><p>Airtable Scripting and Cloudflare Workers work together beautifully. Building APIs on Workers allows more complex tasks to run on the Cloudflare network. These APIs are then fetched by Airtable scripts, solving the code-sharing issue and speeding up development.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"shopify-order-importing\">Shopify Order Importing</h3>\n            <a href=\"#shopify-order-importing\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>First, we needed to import orders from Shopify into Airtable.

I started noticing minor issues with the workflow that could be improved. For example, when an order has to be split into multiple packages, the row in Airtable has to be duplicated and have a suffix added to the order number for each order. Automating order splitting was not a priority previously, but it quickly became one of the most time-consuming parts of the process. Thirty minutes later, every row had a “Split order” button, built with another Airtable script.</p><p>Another issue was when a customer was not going to be home on a Wednesday, which meant that if the order got shipped on Monday, it would go bad sitting on their doorstep. Thankfully, adding an optional minimum ship date tag to the Workers API that gets shippable orders was quick and easy. Now, our sales team can add tags for minimum ship dates when customers are not home, and the rest of the workflow will automatically take it into account when deciding what to ship.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n            <a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Many businesses are turning to Workers for their incredible performance and scaling to millions or billions of requests, but we couldn’t be happier with how much value we get with the few hundred Workers requests we do every day.</p><p>Cloudflare Workers, especially in combination with tools like Airtable, make it really easy to create your own internal tool, built to your exact specifications.
