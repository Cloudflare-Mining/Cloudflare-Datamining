Yes, caching improves performance, but significant performance improvement comes with a series of headaches. The CDN can make a guess at which assets it should cache, but that is just a guess. Configuring your site for maximum performance has always been an error-prone process, requiring a wide collection of esoteric rules and headers. Even when perfectly configured, almost nothing is cached forever, precious requests still often need to travel all the way to your origin (wherever it may be). Cache invalidation is, after all, one of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/secretgeek/status/7269997868\">hardest problems in computer science</a>.</p><p>This begs the question: rather than moving bytes from the origin to the edge bit by bit clumsily, why not push the whole origin to the edge?</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"workers-sites-extending-the-workers-platform\">Workers Sites: Extending the Workers platform</h2>\n            <a href=\"#workers-sites-extending-the-workers-platform\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Two years ago for Birthday Week, we announced <a href=\"https://workers.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Workers</a>, a way for developers to write and run JavaScript and WebAssembly on our network in 194 cities around the world.

Born on the edge, Workers Sites is what we think modern development on the web should look like, natively secure, fast, and massively scalable.

This test was for our site but your results may vary.</p><p>One common way to benchmark the performance of your site using <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse\">Google Lighthouse</a>, which you can do directly from the Audits tab of your Chrome browser.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1UOVn62zLc7zc549glFiTO/ceeab2a5a7bd731aa28d6020855beee1/image1-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1514\" height=\"710\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>So we passed the first test with flying colors — 100! However, running a benchmark from your own computer introduces a bias: your users are not necessarily where you are. In fact, your users are increasingly <i>not</i> where you are.</p><p>Where you’re benchmarking from is really important: running tests from different locations will yield different results. Benchmarking from Seattle and hitting a server on the West coast says very little about your global performance.</p><p>We decided to use a tool called Catchpoint to run benchmarks from cities around the world. To see how we compare, we deployed the site to three different static site deployment platforms including Workers Sites.</p><p>Since providers offer data center regions on the coasts of the United States, or Central Europe, it’s common to see good performance in regions such as North America, and we’ve got you covered here:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7C2l8XZO7Zb541CMMGGlmp/f9c75d30557d0b5f6b3e1c78a0a48994/Screen-Shot-2019-09-26-at-10.58.41-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1782\" height=\"1070\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>But what about your users in the rest of the world? Performance is even more critical in those regions: the first users are not going to be connecting to your site on a MacBook Pro, on a blazing fast connection. Workers Sites allows you to reach those regions without any additional effort on your part — every time <a href=\"/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/\">our map grows</a>, your global presence grows with it.</p><p>We’ve done the work of running some benchmarks from different parts of the world for you, and we’re pleased to share the results:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6MWlNMQWy0ithl7CEi7C9o/2e5ce64bf0d018b720968f17e07c46dd/Screen-Shot-2019-09-26-at-10.58.24-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"856\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"one-last-thing\">One last thing...</h2>\n            <a href=\"#one-last-thing\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Deploying your next site with Workers Sites is easy and leads to great performance, so we thought it was only right that we deploy with Workers Sites ourselves.
