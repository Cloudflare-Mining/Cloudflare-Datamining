Using BGP Anycast, customer traffic is routed to the closest point of presence of Cloudflare’s network edge where it is filtered by customer-defined network firewall rules and automatic DDoS mitigation systems. Clean traffic is then routed via dynamic GRE Anycast tunnels to the customer&#39;s data-centers. Routing at L3 means that we have limited visibility into the higher layers. So in order to provide Magic Transit customers visibility into traffic and attacks, we needed to extend our analytics platform to the packet-layer.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4av9KajzHgNLjrfDbhGD08/363c783d5a4ce6261c200c7e10bd23ff/image-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1750\" height=\"946\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Magic Transit Traffic Flow</p><p>On January 16, 2020, we released the <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038696631-Understanding-Cloudflare-Network-Analytics\">Network Analytics</a> dashboard for <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/\">Magic Transit</a> customers and Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) customers.

Traffic is sampled at the edge data-centers. From those samples we structure IP flow logs which are similar to SFlow and bucket one minute&#39;s worth of traffic, grouped by destination IP, port and protocol. IP flows includes multiple packet attributes such as TCP flags, source IPs and ports, Cloudflare data-center, etc. The source IP is considered PII data and is therefore only stored for 30 days, after which the source IPs are discarded and logs are rolled up into one hour groups, and then one day groups. The one hour roll-ups are stored for 6 months and the one day roll-ups for 1 year.</p><p>Similarly, attack logs are also stored efficiently. Attacks are stored as summaries with start/end timestamps, min/max/average/total bits and packets per second, attack type, action taken and more. A DDoS attack could easily consist of billions of packets which could impact performance due to the number of read/write calls to the data-store. By storing attacks as summary logs, we&#39;re able to overcome these challenges and therefore provide attack logs for up to 1 year back.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"network-analytics-via-graphql-api\">Network Analytics via GraphQL API</h3>\n            <a href=\"#network-analytics-via-graphql-api\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>We built this dashboard on the same analytics platform, meaning that our packet-level analytics are also available by GraphQL.

The query is done at the account level, meaning it would provide a report for all of your IP ranges. In order to narrow the report down to a specific destination IP or port range, you can simply add additional filters. The same filters also exist in the UI.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">{\n  viewer {\n    accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {\n      topNPorts: ipFlows1mGroups(\n        limit: 5\n        filter: $portFilter\n        orderBy: [sum_packets_DESC]\n      ) {\n        sum {\n          count: packets\n          __typename\n        }\n        dimensions {\n          metric: sourcePort\n          ipProtocol\n          __typename\n        }\n        __typename\n      }\n      topNASN: ipFlows1mGroups(\n        limit: 5\n        filter: $filter\n        orderBy: [sum_packets_DESC]\n      ) {\n        sum {\n          count: packets\n          __typename\n        }\n        dimensions {\n          metric: sourceIPAsn\n          description: sourceIPASNDescription\n          __typename\n        }\n        __typename\n      }\n      topNIPs: ipFlows1mGroups(\n        limit: 5\n        filter: $filter\n        orderBy: [sum_packets_DESC]\n      ) {\n        sum {\n          count: packets\n          __typename\n        }\n        dimensions {\n          metric: sourceIP\n          __typename\n        }\n        __typename\n      }\n      topNColos: ipFlows1mGroups(\n        limit: 10\n        filter: $filter\n        orderBy: [sum_packets_DESC]\n      ) {\n        sum {\n          count: packets\n          __typename\n        }\n        dimensions {\n          metric: coloCity\n          coloCode\n          __typename\n        }\n        __typename\n      }\n      topNCountries: ipFlows1mGroups(\n        limit: 10\n        filter: $filter\n        orderBy: [sum_packets_DESC]\n      ) {\n        sum {\n          count: packets\n          __typename\n        }\n        dimensions {\n          metric: coloCountry\n          __typename\n        }\n        __typename\n      }\n      topNIPVersions: ipFlows1mGroups(\n        limit: 2\n        filter: $filter\n        orderBy: [sum_packets_DESC]\n      ) {\n        sum {\n          count: packets\n          __typename\n        }\n        dimensions {\n          metric: ipVersion\n          __typename\n        }\n        __typename\n      }\n      __typename\n    }\n    __typename\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>Attack Report Query Example</p><p>After running the query using Altair GraphQL Client, the response is returned in a JSON format:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2Di3dzwDX6jtShRjooRjud/ddf2420c5fecaf290782c80a9809cc1a/image-8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1244\" height=\"1070\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"what-do-customers-want\">What Do Customers Want?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#what-do-customers-want\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>As part of our product definition and design research stages, we interviewed internal customer-facing teams including Customer Support, Solution Engineering and more.

We wanted to know how they expect the dashboard to fit in their work-flow, what are their use cases and how we can tailor the dashboard to their needs. Long story short, we identified two main use cases: Incident Response and Reporting.

It’s Black Friday. You’re on call. You’ve just been paged. Traffic levels to one of your data-centers has exceeded a safe threshold. Boom. What do you do? Responding quickly and resolving the issue as soon as possible is key.</p><p>If your workflows are similar to our customers’, then your objective is to resolve the page as soon as possible. However, before you can resolve it, you need to determine if there is any action that you need to take. For instance, is this a legitimate rise in traffic from excited Black Friday shoppers, perhaps a new game release or maybe an attack that hasn’t been mitigated? Do you need to shift traffic to another data-center or are levels still stable? Our customers tell us that these are the metrics that matter the most:</p><ol><li><p>Top Destination IP and port - helps understand what services are being impacted</p></li><li><p>Top source IPs, port, ASN, data-center and data-center Country - helps identify the source of the traffic</p></li><li><p>Real-time packet and bit rates - helps understand the traffic levels</p></li><li><p>Protocol distribution - helps understand what type of traffic is abnormal</p></li><li><p>TCP flag distribution - an abnormal distribution could indicate an attack</p></li><li><p>Attack Log - shows what types of traffic is being dropped/rate-limited</p></li></ol>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3jXNAgf5eCl4TZHjSum69h/fd1ae990776eacc8c42a4a71c93a440f/pasted-image-0--1-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1252\" height=\"634\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Customizable DDoS Attack Log</p><p>As network and transport layer attacks can be highly distributed and the packet attributes can be easily spoofed, it&#39;s usually not practical to block IPs. Instead, the dashboard enables you to quickly identify patterns such as an increased frequency of a specific TCP flag or increased traffic from a specific country. Identifying these patterns brings you one step closer to resolving the issue. After you’ve identified the patterns, packet-level filtering can be applied to drop or rate-limit the malicious traffic. If the attack was automatically mitigated by Cloudflare’s systems, you’ll be able to see it immediately along with the attack attributes in the activity log. By filtering by the Attack ID, the entire dashboard becomes your attack report.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/anQdgAoCWBPEpXqxwsIlu/ca684ea2d4a28572c257a418885a6f2a/pasted-image-0--2-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1320\" height=\"1118\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Packet/Bit Distribution by Source &amp; Destination</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4gZCFJPtI8Ca5LzU1hObkq/c7d8e4fb66ff42d53266ee3f8a642052/pasted-image-0--3-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"474\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>TCP Flag Distribution</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"reporting\">Reporting</h2>\n            <a href=\"#reporting\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>During our interviews with security and network engineers, we also asked them what metrics and insights they need when creating reports for their managers, C-levels, colleagues and providing evidence to law-enforcement agencies.

Cool Maps! The key to a good report is adding a map; showing where the attack came from. But given that packet attributes can be easily spoofed, including the source IP, it won&#39;t do us any good to plot a map based on the locations of the source IPs. It would result in a spoofed source country and is therefore useless data. Instead, we decided to show the geographic distribution of packets and bits based on the Cloudflare data-center in which they were ingested. As opposed to legacy scrubbing center solutions with limited network infrastructures, Cloudflare has data-centers in more than 200 cities around the world. This enables us to provide precise geographic distribution with high confidence, making your reports accurate.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2oK50PYyfJ1YpCsoToPxUJ/8d2bc811cec25424abcd4cc9f004bcf0/pasted-image-0--4-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"479\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Packet/Bit Distribution by geography: Data-center City &amp; Country</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"tailored-for-you\">Tailored For You</h3>\n            <a href=\"#tailored-for-you\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>One of the main challenges both our customers and we struggle with is how to process and generate actionable insights from all of the data points.
