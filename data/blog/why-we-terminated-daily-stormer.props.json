We&#39;ve argued that it doesn&#39;t make sense to regulate content at the proxy, where Cloudflare provides service, since if we terminate a user the content won&#39;t go away it will just be slower and more vulnerable to attack.</p><p>That&#39;s true, and made sense for a long time, but increasingly may not be relevant. The size and scale of the attacks that can now easily be launched online make it such that if you don&#39;t have a network like Cloudflare in front of your content, and you upset anyone, you will be knocked offline. In fact, in the case of the Daily Stormer, the initial requests we received to terminate their service came from hackers who literally said: &quot;Get out of the way so we can DDoS this site off the Internet.&quot;</p><p>You, like me, may believe that the Daily Stormer&#39;s site is vile. You may believe it should be restricted. You may think the authors of the site should be prosecuted. Reasonable people can and do believe all those things. But having the mechanism of content control be vigilante hackers launching DDoS attacks subverts any rational concept of justice.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"increasing-dependence-on-a-few-giant-networks\">Increasing Dependence On A Few Giant Networks</h3>\n            <a href=\"#increasing-dependence-on-a-few-giant-networks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In a not-so-distant future, if we&#39;re not there already, it may be that if you&#39;re going to put content on the Internet you&#39;ll need to use a company with a giant network like Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, or Alibaba.</p><p>For context, Cloudflare currently handles around 10% of Internet requests.</p><p>Without a clear framework as a guide for content regulation, a small number of companies will largely determine what can and cannot be online.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"freedom-of-speech-due-process\">Freedom of Speech &lt; Due Process</h3>\n            <a href=\"#freedom-of-speech-due-process\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The issue of who can and cannot be online has often been associated with Freedom of Speech.

On the other hand, the concept of Due Process is close to universal. At its most basic, Due Process means that you should be able to know the rules a system will follow if you participate in that system.</p><p>Due Process requires that decisions be public and not arbitrary. It&#39;s why we&#39;ve always said that our policy is to follow the guidance of the law in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Thatâ€™s worked and all four of the warrant canaries have survived in every transparency report since 2013.</p><p>We&#39;re going to have a long debate internally about whether we need to remove the bullet about not terminating a customer due to political pressure. It&#39;s powerful to be able to say you&#39;ve never done something.
