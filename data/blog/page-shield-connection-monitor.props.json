Common examples include checkout services, analytics tools, or live chat integrations. Any one of these JavaScript libraries may be sending site visitors’ data to unknown locations.</p><p>If you manage a website, and you have ever wondered where end user data might be going and who has access to it, starting today, you can find out using <a href=\"/page-shield-generally-available/\">Page Shield</a>’s Connection Monitor.</p><p>Page Shield is our client side security solution that aims to detect malicious behavior and compromises that affect the browser environment directly, such as those that exploit vulnerabilities in third party JavaScript libraries.</p><p>Connection Monitor, available from today, is the latest addition to Page Shield and allows you to see outbound connections being made by your users’ browsers initiated by third party JavaScript added to your site. You can then review this information to ensure only appropriate third parties are receiving sensitive data.</p><p>Customers on our business and enterprise plans receive visibility in outbound connections provided by Connection Monitor. If you are using our Page Shield enterprise add-on, you also get notifications whenever a connection is found to be potentially malicious.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"covering-more-attack-surface-with-connection-monitor\">Covering more attack surface with Connection Monitor</h3>\n            <a href=\"#covering-more-attack-surface-with-connection-monitor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Connection Monitor expands the net of opportunities to catch malicious behavior that might be happening in your users’ browsers by complementing the visibility provided by <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield/use-dashboard/monitor-scripts/\">Script Monitor</a>, the core feature of Page Shield before today.</p><p>While Script Monitor is focusing on analyzing JavaScript code to find malicious signals, Connection Monitor is looking at where data is sent to.

This is useful in principle, but in practice CSPs are hard to maintain for large applications, and often end up being very broad making them ineffective. More importantly, CSPs provide no built-in mechanism to detect malicious behavior. This is where Page Shield helps.</p><p>Before today, with Script Monitor, Page Shield would detect malicious behavior by focusing on JavaScript files only, by running, among other things, <a href=\"/detecting-magecart-style-attacks-for-pageshield/\">our classifier on JavaScript code</a>.

When turned on, it will, on a sampled percentage of HTML page loads only, insert the following HTTP response header that implements the Content Security Policy used to receive data:</p><p><code>content-security-policy-report-only: script-src &#39;none&#39;; connect-src &#39;none&#39;; report-uri &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;/cdn-cgi/script_monitor/report?&lt;QUERY_STRING&gt;</code></p><p>This HTTP response header asks the browser to send information regarding scripts (<code>script-src</code>) and connections (<code>connect-src</code>) to the given endpoint. By default, the endpoint hostname is <code>csp-reporting.cloudflare.com</code>, but you can change it to be the same hostname of your website if you are on our enterprise add-on.</p><p>Using the above CSP, browsers will report any <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/connect-src\">connections initiated by</a>:</p><ul><li><p><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> ping,</p></li><li><p><code>fetch()</code>,</p></li><li><p><code>XMLHttpRequest</code>,</p></li><li><p><code>WebSocket</code>,</p></li><li><p><code>EventSource</code>, and</p></li><li><p><code>Navigator.sendBeacon()</code></p></li></ul><p>An example connection report is shown below:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">&quot;csp-report&quot;: {\n    &quot;document-uri&quot;: &quot;https://cloudflare.com/&quot;,\n    &quot;referrer&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n    &quot;violated-directive&quot;: &quot;connect-src&quot;,\n    &quot;effective-directive&quot;: &quot;connect-src&quot;,\n    &quot;original-policy&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n    &quot;disposition&quot;: &quot;report&quot;,\n    &quot;blocked-uri&quot;: &quot;wss://example.com/&quot;,\n    &quot;line-number&quot;: 5,\n    &quot;column-number&quot;: 16,\n    &quot;source-file&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n    &quot;status-code&quot;: 200,\n    &quot;script-sample&quot;: &quot;&quot;\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>Using reports like the one above, we can then create an inventory of outbound connection URLs alongside which pages they were initiated by.

For this reason, Connection Monitor by default will only store and collect the scheme and host portion of the connection URL, so for example, if the endpoint the browser is sending data to is:</p><p><code>https://connection.example.com/session/abc</code></p><p>Connection Monitor will only store <code>https://connection.example.com</code> and drop the path <code>/session/abc</code>. This ensures that we are minimizing the risk of storing session IDs, or other sensitive data that may be found in full URLs.</p><p>Not storing the path, does mean that in some specific circumstances, we are not able to do full URL feed lookups from our threat intelligence. For this reason, if you know you are not inserting sensitive data in connection paths, you can easily turn on path storage from the dashboard. Domain lookups will continue to work as expected. Support for also storing the query string will be added in the future.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"going-further\">Going further</h3>\n            <a href=\"#going-further\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Script Monitor and Connection Monitor are only two of many directives provided by CSP that we plan to support in Page Shield.
