The post examined the impact that these shutdowns have on Internet traffic, and also analyzed routing information and traffic from other Cloudflare services in an effort to better understand how these shutdowns are being implemented.</p><p>In addition to the shutdowns covered in the previously referenced blog post, Iraq implemented a second round of shutdowns that started on June 23, and ran through at least July 14.

Sometimes more mundane technical issues can cause problems when users try to access the Internet. One example of this occurred on April 15 in Malaysia, when customers of <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as9930\">Time Internet</a> experienced a network outage for nearly two hours. The company explained the reason for the outage in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TimeInternet/posts/pfbid0RbJE44cgJvxA9FQSKFTVoe4NbJBdGuwkyXjuB5URiAW78zmgS5x1V8YPUt91ym9Al\">contrite post on their Facebook page</a>, stating in part “<i>This Internet service outage was by far the worst in our history - affecting approximately 40% of our customers. … At 5.38pm today, both our primary and secondary Secure DNS servers became unreachable. This means that any browser or service requiring a DNS address resolution was not able to reach its intended site.</i>” Because subscribers could not reach Time Internet’s DNS resolvers, they were unable to resolve hostnames for Internet services, sites, and applications, including those delivered by Cloudflare. This resulted in the drop in traffic seen in the graph below, which started just after 17:00 local time (05:00 UTC), and began to recover approximately an hour later.

However, what is particularly interesting is the spike in traffic to Cloudflare from Starlink’s network following the resolution of the outage. The sharp increase and rapid decline of the traffic curve after service was restored suggests that it may be related to an automated connectivity check of some kind, rather than pent-up user demand for content.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-05-28&dateEnd=2024-05-29&location=as14593&chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D\" title=\"Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"chad\">Chad</h3>\n            <a href=\"#chad\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>A near-complete Internet outage was observed in <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/td\">Chad</a> on June 5 between 08:15 - 12:00 local time (07:15 - 11:00 UTC), as seen in the graph below.
