Instead, it stretches through Cyber Week and beyond, including flash sales, pre-orders, and various other promotions.

In addition to looking across our entire network, we also analyzed traffic patterns specifically on a cohort of e-commerce sites. </p><p>Legitimate shoppers flocked to e-commerce sites, with requests reaching an astounding 405 billion on Black Friday, accounting for 81% of the day’s total traffic to e-commerce sites. Retailers reaped the rewards of their deals and advertising, seeing a 50% surge in shoppers week-over-week and a 61% increase compared to the previous month.</p><p>Unfortunately, Grinch Bots were equally active. Total e-commerce bot activity surged to 103 billion requests, representing up to 19% of all traffic to e-commerce sites. Nearly one in every five requests to an online store was not a real customer. That’s a lot of resources to waste on bogus traffic.

Interestingly, while humans only accounted for 36% of traffic to login pages on Black Friday, this number was <b><i>up 7-8% compared to the prior month</i></b>. This suggests that more shoppers logged in to capitalize on deals and discounts on Black Friday than in preceding weeks. Human logins peaked at around 40% of all traffic to login sites on the Monday before Thanksgiving, and again on Cyber Monday.  </p><p>Separately, we also saw a 37% increase in leaked passwords used in login requests compared to the prior month.

This obfuscation makes these requests look like legitimate customers browsing from their homes rather than large cloud networks. The large pool of IP addresses and the diversity of networks poses a challenge to traditional bot defense mechanisms that rely on IP reputation and rate limiting. </p><p>Moreover, the diversity of IP addresses enables the attackers to rotate through them indefinitely.

As sale periods lengthen (like they did in 2024) we expect more peaks in human activity on e-commerce sites across November and December. This is great for consumers and great for merchants.</p><p>More AI bots and agents will be integrated into e-commerce journeys in 2025. AI bots will not only be crawling sites for training data, but will also integrate into the shopping experience. AI bots did not exist in 2021, but now make up 1% of all bot traffic. This is only the tip of the iceberg and their growth will explode in the next year. We expect this to pose new risks as bots mimic and act on behalf of humans.</p><p>More sophisticated automation through network, device, and cookie cycling will also become a bigger threat. Bot operators will continue to employ advanced evasion tactics like rotating devices, IP addresses, and cookies to bypass detection.</p><p>Grinch Bots are evolving, and regulation may be slowing, but businesses don’t have to face them alone. We remain resolute in our mission to help build a better Internet ... and holiday shopping experience.</p><p>Even though the holiday season is closing out soon, bots are never on vacation. It’s never too late or too early to start protecting your customers and your business from grinches that work all year round.</p><p>Wishing you all happy holidays and a bot-free new year!</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1E192osHHmrXszsfbE2fIa/f7d04ea59ef6355eb78fed4e2fa15bd4/image6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1199\" height=\"159\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p></p>",
