	<p>It's not every day that there is no Internet access in an entire country. In the case of Sudan, it has been seven days without Internet after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c1yy8q1re0kt/sudan-crisis">political turmoil</a> that started last Monday, October 25, 2021 (as we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sudan-woke-up-without-internet">described</a>).</p>
	<p>The outage continues with almost a flat line and just a trickle of Internet traffic from Sudan. <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/sd">Cloudflare Radar</a> shows that the Internet in Sudan is still almost completely cut off.</p>

	<p>There was a blip of traffic on Tuesday at ~14:00 UTC, for about one hour, but it flattened out again, and it continues like that — anyone can track the evolution on the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/sd">Sudan page of Cloudflare Radar</a>.</p>

	<p>Internet disruptions, including shutdowns and social media restrictions, are common occurrences in some countries and Sudan is one where this happens more frequently than most countries <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/global-5#">according to Human Rights Watch</a>. In our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sudans-exam-related-internet-shutdowns">June blog</a>, we talked about Sudan when the country decided to shut down the Internet to prevent cheating in exams, but there were situations in the past more similar to this days-long shutdown — something that usually happens when there’s political unrest.</p>
	<p>The country's longest recorded network disruption was back in 2018, when Sudanese authorities cut off access to social media (and messaging apps like WhatsApp) for <a href="https://allafrica.com/stories/202110250675.html">68 consecutive days</a> from December 21, 2018 to February 26, 2019. There was a full mobile Internet shutdown <a href="https://technext.ng/2021/10/28/history-repeats-itself-in-sudan-as-military-junta-shut-down-internet-after-coup">reported</a> from June 3 to July 9, 2019 that lasted 36 days.</p>
