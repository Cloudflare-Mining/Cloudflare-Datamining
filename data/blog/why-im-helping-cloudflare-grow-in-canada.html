	<p>I am incredibly excited to join Cloudflare as Head of Sales for Canada to expand the company’s growth in the region as part of its mission to help build a better Internet. This is an important milestone for Cloudflare to better serve the needs of our Canadian customers, recruit local talent, and build on the regional successes we’ve had around the globe.</p>
	<p>Internet security, privacy, and performance are key drivers for every business, individual, and public sector organization. Universal dependency on the Internet has significantly increased, with web commerce, remote learning, distributed teams, remote work, virtual meetings etc. — and this is all here to stay.</p>
	<p>Over the last few years we have seen the industry move from on-premise infrastructure and applications to a cloud-first approach with cloud and SaaS architectures. As this significant and inevitable transition has accelerated, it has introduced new complexities, challenges, and opportunities for organizations with the evolution to heterogeneous environments across public cloud, on-premise, and hybrid deployments.</p>
	<p>At the same time, a company’s digital assets (data, web properties, applications, etc.) have become their most valuable assets. How an organization uses the Internet to serve their customers, partners, and employees has become a strategic priority for organizations around the world. With the rapid shift to remote work caused by the pandemic, businesses of all sizes are looking to adopt a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust">Zero Trust architecture</a>. According to an October 2020 commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting, 76% of businesses today say their organization’s security approach is “antiquated” and that they need to shift to a Zero Trust framework. The Cloudflare team in Canada is dedicated to helping Canadian organizations successfully scale and optimize their businesses in this landscape.</p>
	<p>At the same time, the threat landscape has evolved faster than ever before. In the first quarter of 2021 alone, Cloudflare blocked an average of 3.2 billion attacks per day originating in Canada—a 26.53% increase from the previous quarter. There is a need to secure websites, corporate and personal data, users, applications, and entire networks in a different way. In a way that provides cloud-based <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions">security</a> and network services—to scale with organizations and their business needs.</p>
	<p>The volume and sophistication of network attacks can strain the defensive capabilities of even the most advanced enterprises, especially as many organizations have traditional security and network architectures with individual equipment for specific functions in corporate data centers. Leveraging cloud-based security and networking functionalities provides an architectural shift with better security, performance, and reliability. This is how Cloudflare’s global network, one of the largest in the world, protects <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/enterprise-networking">enterprise networks</a>, applications, and users in a way that reduces complexity, and enables organizational agility.</p>

	<p>My background includes years of working with enterprise and public sector customers to address their business needs and technology challenges with innovative software and services. My career has included leadership positions with Cisco, Splunk, CenturyLink, and Microsoft with responsibilities across sales leadership, solutions engineering, business development, and alliances. I’ve had the pleasure of leading teams to serve enterprise customers in Canada, the Americas, and across the globe, with technologies in security, networking, cloud, and XaaS. Providing solutions to customers, to enable them to address their unique needs, and ultimately transform their organizations, is something I’m excited to help achieve with Cloudflare.</p>
