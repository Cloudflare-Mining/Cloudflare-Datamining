He is responsible for overseeing operations for the company&#39;s domain registration, domain portfolio, email and retail lines of business. Elliot has been a leader in the Internet industry for over a decade. He champions areas of vital interest to the service providers and Internet users including privacy, ICANN reform and registrar matters, and the implications of emerging technologies.</p><p>When we sat down with Elliot at HostingCon, we were expecting to hear the newest updates on Tucows&#39; hosting, domain name and email services. What we didn&#39;t expect was their announcement of their mobile service, <a href=\"https://ting.com/\">ting.com</a>. Just like Tucows changed how domain registration worked over the last 10 years, Tucows figured the mobile industry needed the same overhaul and launched Ting.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a flat-out mobile service. We will be your phone carrier - the kinder, gentler phone carrier,&quot; said Elliot. &quot;We decided to just reinvent the whole thing from the ground up and be the mobile carrieryou wish you had.&quot;</p><p>Serving just the United States for the next two to three years, Ting has been on the market for about six months and customers are already loving it.</p><p>&quot;Customers are thrilled. They are saving a lot of money and they are loving the experience,&quot; said Elliot.</p><p>Currently Ting is only available on Android devices, but Elliot and his team are working to get the iPhone supported as well.</p><p>We are excited for Tucows&#39; venture in the mobile market and look forward to the service taking off over the next couple of years. Tune in to the full interview to hear details about Ting.</p><p><i>At HostingCon 2012, </i><a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/\"><i>CloudFlare</i></a><i> co-founder </i><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/zatlyn\"><i>Michelle Zatlyn</i></a><i> sat down with 28 leading experts in the hosting industry.
