	<p>Last night CloudFlare hosted a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SFNoSQL/events/16890931">Hybrid DB meetup</a> where Ian Pye, our lead Analytics Engineer, presented on the data infrastructure at CloudFlare. He discussed how CloudFlare looked at several NoSQL and SQL solutions and ended up with a hybrid model, SortaSQL.</p>
	<p>Reviews from attendees: "mindblowing, actually" and "very clever."</p>
