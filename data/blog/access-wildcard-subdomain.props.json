What changed?</p><p>Cloudflare released <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-access/\">Access</a>, and now we’re able to do our work without ever needing a VPN again. Access is a way to control access to your internal applications and infrastructure. Today, we’re releasing a new feature to help you replace your VPN by deploying Access at an even greater scale.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"access-in-an-instant\">Access in an instant</h3>\n            <a href=\"#access-in-an-instant\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Access replaces a corporate VPN by evaluating every request made to a resource secured behind Access. Administrators can make web applications, remote desktops, and physical servers available at dedicated URLs, configured as DNS records in Cloudflare. These tools are protected via access policies, set by the account owner, so that only authenticated users can access those resources. These end users are able to be authenticated over both HTTPS and SSH requests. They’re prompted to login with their SSO credentials and Access redirects them to the application or server.</p><p>For your team, Access makes your internal web applications and servers in your infrastructure feel as seamless to reach as your SaaS tools. Originally we built Access to replace our own corporate VPN. In practice, this became the fastest way to control who can reach different pieces of our own infrastructure. However, administrators configuring Access were required to create a discrete policy per each application/hostname. Now, administrators don’t have to create a dedicated policy for each new resource secured by Access; one policy will cover each URL protected.</p><p>When Access launched, the product’s primary use case was to secure internal web applications. Creating unique rules for each was tedious, but manageable. Access has since become a centralized way to secure infrastructure in many environments. Now that companies are using Access to secure hundreds of resources, that method of building policies no longer fits.</p><p>Starting today, Access users can build policies using a wildcard subdomain to replace the typical bottleneck that occurs when replacing dozens or even hundreds of bespoke rules within a single policy. With a wildcard, the same ruleset will now automatically apply to any subdomain your team generates that is gated by Access.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-can-teams-deploy-at-scale-with-wildcard-subdomains\">How can teams deploy at scale with wildcard subdomains?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-can-teams-deploy-at-scale-with-wildcard-subdomains\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Administrators can secure their infrastructure with a wildcard policy in the Cloudflare dashboard.

Many teams use Access to secure dev and staging environments of sites that are being developed before they hit production. Whether for QA or collaboration with partner agencies, Access helps make it possible to share sites quickly with a layer of authentication. With wildcard subdomains, teams are deploying dozens of versions of new sites at new URLs without needing to touch the Access dashboard.</p><p>For example, an administrator can create a policy for “*.example.com” and then developers can deploy iterations of sites at “dev-1.example.com” and “dev-2.example.com” and both inherit the global Access policy.</p><p>The feature is also helping teams lock down their entire hybrid, on-premise, or public cloud infrastructure with the Access SSH feature. Teams can assign dynamic subdomains to their entire fleet of servers, regardless of environment, and developers and engineers can reach them over an SSH connection without a VPN. Administrators can now bring infrastructure online, in an entirely new environment, without additional or custom security rules.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"what-about-creating-dns-records\">What about creating DNS records?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#what-about-creating-dns-records\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Cloudflare Access requires users to associate a resource with a domain or subdomain. While the wildcard policy will cover all subdomains, teams will still need to connect their servers to the Cloudflare network and generate DNS records for those services.</p><p>Argo Tunnel can reduce that burden significantly. <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/quickstart/\">Argo Tunnel</a> lets you expose a server to the Internet without opening any inbound ports. The service runs a lightweight daemon on your server that initiates outbound tunnels to the Cloudflare network.</p><p>Instead of managing DNS, network, and firewall complexity, Argo Tunnel helps administrators serve traffic from their origin through Cloudflare with a single command. That single command will generate the DNS record in Cloudflare automatically, allowing you to focus your time on building and managing your infrastructure.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>More teams are adopting a hybrid or multi-cloud model for deploying their infrastructure.
