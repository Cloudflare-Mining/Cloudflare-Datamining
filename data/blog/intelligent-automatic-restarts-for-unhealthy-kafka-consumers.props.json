We use Kafka as a way to decouple services due to its asynchronous nature and reliability. It allows different teams to work effectively without creating dependencies on one another. You can also read more about how other teams at Cloudflare use Kafka in <a href=\"/http-analytics-for-6m-requests-per-second-using-clickhouse/\">this</a> post.</p><p>Kafka is used to send and receive messages. Messages represent some kind of event like a credit card payment or details of a new user created in your platform. These messages can be represented in multiple ways: JSON, Protobuf, Avro and so on.</p><p>Kafka organises messages in topics. A topic is an ordered log of events in which each message is marked with a progressive offset. When an event is written by an external system, that is appended to the end of that topic. These events are not deleted from the topic by default (retention can be applied).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2KUYbqCCL74YZVU8NXOThl/4ec5024168993a2300add7221016af0d/1-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"715\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Topics are stored as log files on disk, which are finite in size. Partitions are a systematic way of breaking the one topic log file into many logs, each of which can be hosted on separate servers–enabling to scale topics.</p><p>Topics are managed by brokers–nodes in a Kafka cluster. These are responsible for writing new events to partitions, serving reads and replicating partitions among themselves.</p><p>Messages can be consumed by individual consumers or co-ordinated groups of consumers, known as consumer groups.</p><p>Consumers use a unique id (consumer id) that allows them to be identified by the broker as an application which is consuming from a specific topic.</p><p>Each topic can be read by an infinite number of different consumers, as long as they use a different id. Each consumer can replay the same messages as many times as they want.</p><p>When a consumer starts consuming from a topic, it will process all messages, starting from a selected offset, from each partition. With a consumer group, the partitions are divided amongst each consumer in the group. This division is determined by the consumer group leader. This leader will receive information about the other consumers in the group and will decide which consumers will receive messages from which partitions (partition strategy).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6Qe2Qe5nQ5gcHyhV0zpTWw/5182eea9de66164a36a28e92270fdb3f/2-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1518\" height=\"836\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The offset of a consumer’s commit can demonstrate whether the consumer is working as expected.

It’s often best practice to keep these checks simple and perform some basic operations - in this case, something like listing topics. If, for any reason, this check fails consistently, for instance the broker returns a TLS error, Kubernetes terminates the service and starts a new pod of the same service, therefore forcing a new connection. Simple Kafka liveness checks do a good job of understanding when the connection with the broker is unhealthy.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6gNWb3Rit0MmTutsurm7sf/70355c422fab7ebce7d59d8c2c682d6d/5-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1553\" height=\"1151\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"problems-with-kafka-health-checks\">Problems with Kafka health checks</h3>\n            <a href=\"#problems-with-kafka-health-checks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Due to Cloudflare’s scale, a lot of our Kafka topics are divided into multiple partitions (in some cases this can be hundreds!) and in many cases the replica count of our consuming service doesn’t necessarily match the number of partitions on the Kafka topic. This can mean that in a lot of scenarios this simple approach to health checking is not quite enough!</p><p>Microservices that consume from Kafka topics are healthy if they are consuming and committing offsets at regular intervals when messages are being published to a topic. When such services are not committing offsets as expected, it means that the consumer is in a bad state, and it will start accumulating lag.

Some consumers might get their assigned partitions taken away and re-assigned to another consumer. We noticed when this happened within our library implementation; if the consumer doesn’t acknowledge this command, it will wait indefinitely for new messages to be consumed from a partition that it’s no longer assigned to, ultimately leading to a deadlock. Usually a manual restart of the faulty client-side app is needed to resume processing.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"intelligent-health-checks\">Intelligent health checks</h3>\n            <a href=\"#intelligent-health-checks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As we were seeing consumers reporting as “healthy” but sitting idle, it occurred to us that maybe we were focusing on the wrong thing in our health checks. Just because the service is connected to the Kafka broker and can read from the topic, it does not mean the consumer is actively processing messages.</p><p>Therefore, we realised we should be focused on message ingestion, using the offset values to ensure that forward progress was being made.</p><h4>The PagerDuty approach</h4><p>PagerDuty wrote an excellent <a href=\"https://www.pagerduty.com/eng/kafka-health-checks/\">blog</a> on this topic which we used as inspiration when coming up with our approach.</p><p>Their approach used the current (latest) offset and the committed offset values.

This means each instance of our service only has a view of the partitions it is currently consuming from and will run the health check for each.</p><h4>Problems</h4><p>When we first rolled out our smart health checks we started to notice cascading failures some time after release. After initial investigations we realised this was happening when a rebalance happens. It would initially affect one replica then quickly result in the others reporting as unhealthy.</p><p>What we observed was due to us storing the previous value of the committed offset in-memory, when a rebalance happens the service may get re-assigned a different partition. When this happened it meant our service was incorrectly assuming that the committed offset for that partition had not changed (as this specific replica was no longer updating the latest value), therefore it would start to report the service as unhealthy. The failing liveness probe would then cause it to restart which would in-turn trigger another rebalancing in Kafka causing other replicas to face the same issue.</p><h4>Solution</h4><p>To fix this issue we needed to ensure that each replica only kept track of the offsets for the partitions it was consuming from at that moment. Luckily, the Shopify Sarama library, which we use internally, has functionality to observe when a rebalancing happens. This meant we could use it to rebuild the in-memory map of offsets so that it would only include the relevant partition values.</p><p>This is handled by receiving the signal from the session context channel:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-golang\"><code class=\"language-golang\">for {\n  select {\n  case message, ok := &lt;-claim.Messages(): // &lt;-- Message received\n\n     // Store latest received offset in-memory\n     offsetMap[message.Partition] = message.Offset\n\n\n     // Handle message\n     handleMessage(ctx, message)\n\n\n     // Commit message offset\n     session.MarkMessage(message, &quot;&quot;)\n\n\n  case &lt;-session.Context().Done(): // &lt;-- Rebalance happened\n\n     // Remove rebalanced partition from in-memory map\n     delete(offsetMap, claim.Partition())\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>Verifying this solution was straightforward, we just needed to trigger a rebalance. To test this worked in all possible scenarios we spun up a single replica of a service consuming from multiple partitions, then proceeded to scale up the number of replicas until it matched the partition count, then scaled back down to a single replica. By doing this we verified that the health checks could safely handle new partitions being assigned as well as partitions being taken away.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"takeaways\">Takeaways</h3>\n            <a href=\"#takeaways\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Probes in Kubernetes are very easy to set up and can be a powerful tool to ensure your application is running as expected. Well implemented probes can often be the difference between engineers being called out to fix trivial issues (sometimes outside of working hours) and a service which is self-healing.</p><p>However, without proper thought, “dumb” health checks can also lead to a false sense of security that a service is running as expected even when it’s not. One thing we have learnt from this was to think more about the specific behaviour of the service and decide what being unhealthy means in each instance, instead of just ensuring that dependent services are connected.</p>",
