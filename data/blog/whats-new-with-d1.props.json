Prior to D1 we’ve announced storage options like KV (key-value store), Durable Objects (single location, strongly consistent data storage) and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-blob-storage/\">R2 (blob storage)</a>. But the question always remained “How can I store and query relational data without latency concerns and an easy API?”</p><p>The long awaited “Cloudflare Database&#39;&#39; was the true missing piece to build your application <b>entirely</b> on Cloudflare’s global network, going from a blank canvas in VSCode to a full stack application in seconds. Compatible with the popular SQLite API, D1 empowers developers to build out their databases without getting bogged down by complexity and having to manage every underlying layer.</p><p>Since our launch announcement in May and private beta in June, we’ve made great strides in building out our vision of a serverless database. With D1 still in <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/d1/\">private beta</a> but an open beta on the horizon, we’re excited to show and tell our journey of building D1 and what’s to come.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"the-d1-experience\">The D1 Experience</h2>\n      <a href=\"#the-d1-experience\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We knew from Cloudflare Workers feedback that using Wrangler as the mechanism to create and deploy applications is loved and preferred by many.

For D1 today, we don&#39;t try to run a copy in every location worldwide, but dynamically manage the number and location of read-only replicas based on how many queries your database is getting, and from where. However, for queries that make changes to a database (which we generally call &quot;writes&quot; for short), they all have to travel back to the single Primary D1 instance to do their work, to ensure consistency.</p><p>But what if you need to do a series of updates at once? While you can send multiple SQL queries with <code>.batch()</code> (which does in fact use database transactions under the hood), it&#39;s likely that, at some point, you&#39;ll want to interleave database queries &amp; JS code in a single unit of work.</p><p>This is exactly what database transactions were invented for, but if you try running <code>BEGIN TRANSACTION</code> in D1 you&#39;ll get an error. Let&#39;s talk about why that is.</p><p><b>Why native transactions don&#39;t work</b>The problem arises from SQL statements and JavaScript code running in dramatically different places—your SQL executes inside your D1 database (primary for writes, nearest replica for reads), but your Worker is running near the user, which might be on the other side of the world. And because D1 is built on SQLite, only one write transaction can be open at once. Meaning that, if we permitted <code>BEGIN TRANSACTION</code>, any one Worker request, anywhere in the world, could effectively block your whole database! This is a quite dangerous thing to allow:</p><ul><li><p>A Worker could start a transaction then crash due to a software bug, without calling <code>ROLLBACK</code>. The primary would be blocked, waiting for more commands from a Worker that would never come (until, probably, some timeout).</p></li><li><p>Even without bugs or crashes, transactions that require multiple round-trips between JavaScript and SQL could end up blocking your whole system for multiple seconds, dramatically limiting how high an application built with Workers &amp; D1 could scale.</p></li></ul><p>But allowing a developer to define transactions that mix both SQL and JavaScript makes building applications with Workers &amp; D1 so much more flexible and powerful. We need a new solution (or, in our case, a new version of an old solution).</p><p><b>A way forward: stored procedures</b>Stored procedures are snippets of code that are uploaded to the database, to be executed directly next to the data. Which, at first blush, sounds exactly like what we want.</p><p>However, in practice, stored procedures in traditional databases are notoriously frustrating to work with, as anyone who&#39;s developed a system making heavy use of them will tell you:</p><ul><li><p>They&#39;re often written in a different language to the rest of your application. They&#39;re usually written in (a specific dialect of) SQL or an embedded language like Tcl/Perl/Python. And while it&#39;s technically possible to write them in JavaScript (using an embedded V8 engine), they run in such a different environment to your application code it still requires significant context-switching to maintain them.</p></li><li><p>Having both application code and in-database code affects every part of the development lifecycle, from authoring, testing, deployment, rollbacks and debugging. But because stored procedures are usually introduced to solve a specific problem, not as a general purpose application layer, they&#39;re often managed completely manually. You can end up with them being written once, added to the database, then never changed for fear of breaking something.</p></li></ul><p>With D1, we can do better.</p><p>The <i>point</i> of a stored procedure was to execute directly next to the data—uploading the code and executing it inside the database was simply a means to that end. But we&#39;re using Workers, a global JavaScript execution platform, can we use them to solve this problem?</p><p>It turns out, absolutely! But here we have a few options of exactly how to make it work, and we&#39;re working with our private beta users to find the right <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/api/what-is-an-api/\">API</a>. In this section, I&#39;d like to share with you our current leading proposal, and invite you all to give us your feedback.</p><p>When you connect a Worker project to a D1 database, you add the section like the following to your <code>wrangler.toml</code>:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-yaml\"><code class=\"language-yaml\">[[ d1_databases ]]\n# What binding name to use (e.g. env.DB):\nbinding = &quot;DB&quot;\n# The name of the DB (used for wrangler d1 commands):\ndatabase_name = &quot;my-d1-database&quot;\n# The D1&#039;s ID for deployment:\ndatabase_id = &quot;48a4224e-...3b09&quot;\n# Which D1 to use for `wrangler dev`:\n# (can be the same as the previous line)\npreview_database_id = &quot;48a4224e-...3b09&quot;\n\n# NEW: adding &quot;procedures&quot;, pointing to a new JS file:\nprocedures = &quot;./src/db/procedures.js&quot;</pre></code>\n            <p>That D1 Procedures file would contain the following (note the new <code>db.transaction()</code> API, that is only available within a file like this):</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default class Procedures {\n  constructor(db, env, ctx) {\n    this.db = db\n  }\n\n  // any methods you define here are available on env.DB.Procedures\n  // inside your Worker\n  async Checkout(cartId: number) {\n    // Inside a Procedure, we have a new db.transaction() API\n    const result = await this.db.transaction(async (txn) =&gt; {\n      \n      // Transaction has begun: we know the user can&#039;t add anything to\n      // their cart while these actions are in progress.\n      const [cart, user] = Helpers.loadCartAndUser(cartId)\n\n      // We can update the DB first, knowing that if any of the later steps\n      // fail, all these changes will be undone.\n      await this.db\n        .prepare(`UPDATE cart SET status = ?1 WHERE cart_id = ?2`)\n        .bind(&#039;purchased&#039;, cartId)\n        .run()\n      const newBalance = user.balance - cart.total_cost\n      await this.db\n        .prepare(`UPDATE user SET balance = ?1 WHERE user_id = ?2`)\n        // Note: the DB may have a CHECK to guarantee &#039;user.balance&#039; can not\n        // be negative. In that case, this statement may fail, an exception\n        // will be thrown, and the transaction will be rolled back.\n        .bind(newBalance, cart.user_id)\n        .run()\n\n      // Once all the DB changes have been applied, attempt the payment:\n      const { ok, details } = await PaymentAPI.processPayment(\n        user.payment_method_id,\n        cart.total_cost\n      )\n      if (!ok) {\n        // If we throw an Exception, the transaction will be rolled back\n        // and result.error will be populated:\n        // throw new PaymentFailedError(details)\n        \n        // Alternatively, we can do both of those steps explicitly\n        await txn.rollback()\n        // The transaction is rolled back, our DB is now as it was when we\n        // started. We can either move on and try something new, or just exit.\n        return { error: new PaymentFailedError(details) }\n      }\n\n      // This is implicitly called when the .transaction() block finishes,\n      // but you can explicitly call it too (potentially committing multiple\n      // times in a single db.transaction() block).\n      await txn.commit()\n\n      // Anything we return here will be returned by the \n      // db.transaction() block\n      return {\n        amount_charged: cart.total_cost,\n        remaining_balance: newBalance,\n      }\n    })\n\n    if (result.error) {\n      // Our db.transaction block returned an error or threw an exception.\n    }\n\n    // We&#039;re still in the Procedure, but the Transaction is complete and\n    // the DB is available for other writes. We can either do more work\n    // here (start another transaction?) or return a response to our Worker.\n    return result\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>And in your Worker, your DB binding now has a “Procedures” property with your function names available:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">const { error, amount_charged, remaining_balance } =\n  await env.DB.Procedures.Checkout(params.cartId)\n\nif (error) {\n  // Something went wrong, `error` has details\n} else {\n  // Display `amount_charged` and `remaining_balance` to the user.\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>Multiple Procedures can be triggered at one time, but only one <code>db.transaction()</code> function can be active at once: any other write queries or other transaction blocks will be queued, but all read queries will continue to hit local replicas and run as normal. This API gives you the ability to ensure consistency when it’s essential but with the minimal impact on total overall performance worldwide.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"request-for-feedback\">Request for feedback</h3>\n      <a href=\"#request-for-feedback\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>As with all our products, feedback from our users drives the roadmap and development.

If two Workers bind to the same D1 instance but define different procedures, they&#39;ll only see their own code. If you want to share code between projects or databases, extract a library as you would with any other shared code.</p></li><li><p>In local development and test, the procedure works just like it does in production, but without the network call, allowing seamless testing and debugging as if it was a local function.</p></li><li><p>Because procedures and the Worker that define them are treated as a single unit, rolling back to an earlier version never causes a skew between the code in the database and the code in the Worker.</p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"the-d1-ecosystem-contributions-from-the-community\">The D1 ecosystem: contributions from the community</h2>\n      <a href=\"#the-d1-ecosystem-contributions-from-the-community\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We&#39;ve told you about what we&#39;ve been up to and what&#39;s ahead, but one of the unique things about this project is all the contributions from our users.

And fast, reliable testing is a big part of building maintainable real-world apps, so we’re thrilled to extend that to D1.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"want-access-to-the-private-beta\">Want access to the private beta?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#want-access-to-the-private-beta\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Feeling inspired?</p><p>We love to see what our beta users build or want to build especially when our products are at an early stage.
