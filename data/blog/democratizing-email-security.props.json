In 2011 and 2015 we did this for the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">web application firewall</a> and SSL/TLS markets, simplifying the process of protecting websites from application vulnerabilities and encrypting HTTP requests down to single clicks; in 2020, during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made our Zero Trust suite available to everyone; and today—in the face of heightened phishing attacks—we’re doing the same for the email security market.</p><p>Once the acquisition of Area 1 closes, as we expect early in the second quarter of 2022, we plan to give all paid self-serve plans access to their <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/email-security-services/\">email security technology</a> at no additional charge. Control, customization, and visibility via analytics will vary with plan level, and the highest flexibility and support levels will be available to Enterprise customers for purchase.</p><p>All self-serve users will also get access to a more feature-packed version of the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust solution</a> we made available to everyone in 2020. Zero Trust services are incomplete without an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/\">email security solution</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/10/01/cisa-kicks-cybersecurity-awareness-month\">CISA’s recent report</a> makes that clearer than ever: over 90% of successful cyber attacks start with a phishing email, so we expect that over time analysts will have no choice but to include email in their definitions of secure access and zero edges.</p><p><b>If you’re interested in reserving your place in line, register your interest by logging into your Cloudflare account at dash.cloudflare.com, selecting your domain, clicking Email, and then “Join Waitlist” at the top of the page; we’ll reach out after the Area 1 acquisition is completed, and the integration is ready, in the order we received your request.</b></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"one-click-deployment\">One-click deployment</h3>\n            <a href=\"#one-click-deployment\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>If you’re already managing your authoritative DNS with Cloudflare, as nearly 100% of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/\">non-Enterprise plans</a> are, there will just be a single click to get started.
