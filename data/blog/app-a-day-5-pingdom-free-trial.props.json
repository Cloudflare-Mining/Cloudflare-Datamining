Website owners deserve nothing less. Because we believe in transparency, we provide insight into our <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/system-status.html\">system status</a>. Still, it's important to have third-party verification, so we encourage the use of outside monitors.</p>\n<p>Today's App can help. Pingdom is a leader in uptime monitoring. From your CloudFlare dashboard, you can create a Pingdom account with free monitoring for a single domain. For those with multiple domains or more complex requirements, the upgrade is easy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pingdomfeatures\">Pingdom Features</h3>\n<p>There's more detail available but the core benefits of Pingdom include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alerts on downtime</li>\n<li>Performance and uptime stats</li>\n<li>Helps you troubleshoot downtime</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"howtocreateyourfreepingdomaccount\">How to Create Your Free Pingdom Account</h3>\n<p>Getting started with Pingdom is simple. Visit the Pingdom [link removed] page in CloudFlare Apps, continue to the CloudFlare Apps page for your preferred domain, and toggle the switch ON... your free account will be created instantly, with a link to configure your settings.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
