At Cloudflare, our mission is to build a better Internet and part of that is ensuring that users have access to accurate, trusted information, in a safe environment. With many upcoming elections in 2020, it is important that we have confidence in the democratic processes and that starts with ensuring their website infrastructure and internal teams are secure against malicious efforts to take them offline and shake voter’s faith in democracy.</p><p>Cloudflare has made election security a priority, investing our time in the Athenian Project and Cloudflare for Campaigns as political campaigns and state and local government election websites are the first line of defense in election security. In 2016, it was <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume1.pdf\">reported by the Department of Homeland Security</a> that state and local government election infrastructure in all 50 states were targeted during the Presidential election. Fast forward to 2020, we are protecting more than 170 state and local government election websites and providing services to 18 of the 32 U.S. Presidential campaigns.</p><p>Therefore, it seems fitting that we celebrate the Centennial anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment and International Women’s Day, highlighting the achievement of women throughout history and the importance of voter confidence in the democratic institutions that many fought to participate and have their voices heard.</p><p>Working at Cloudflare has allowed me to learn how important access to information is to Internet users, and voters across the world, and I am proud to work for a company that supports strengthening democracy.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about our election project, please visit <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/\">cloudflare.com/athenian/</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/campaigns/usa/\">cloudflare.com/campaigns/usa/</a>.</p>",
