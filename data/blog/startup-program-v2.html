	<p>Starting a business is hard. And we know that the first few years of your business are crucial to your success.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare’s Startup Plan is here to help.</p>
	<p>Last year, we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-cloudflare-startup-enterprise-plan-helping-new-startups-bootstrap">piloted a program</a> to a select group of startups for free, with a selection of products that are very high leverage for young startups, early in their product development, like Workers, Stream, and Zero Trust.</p>
	<p>Over the past year, startup founders repeatedly wrote into <a href="mailto:startups@cloudflare.com">startups@cloudflare.com</a>, and most of these emails followed one of 2 patterns:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>A startup would like to request additional products that are not a part of the startup plan, often Workers KV, Pages, Cloudflare for SaaS, R2, Argo, etc.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A startup that is not a part of any accelerator program but would like to get on the startup plan.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Based on this feedback, we are thrilled to announce that today we will be increasing the scope of the program to also include popularly requested products! Beyond that, we’re also super excited to be broadening the eligibility criteria, so more startups can qualify for the plan.</p>

	<p><sup>* </sup>Product-specific usage limits apply</p>
	<p><sup>** </sup>The above listed products and enablement video training are included in the startup plan. Occasionally, for some products, to help with the complexities of setting up some products, enterprise customers typically purchase an additional onboarding support package (which is not included in the startup plan, but is available for purchase). Products that commonly need additional onboarding support include: Aegis, Custom Tiered Cache, Argo Tunnels for Load Balancers, Magic Transit (adding and removing subnets), BYOIP / static IP, Dedicated Gateway IP, FedRAMP Setup.</p>
	<p>With the expanded product basket, the Startup Plan v2.0 provides four times the value of the original program. As an added bonus when new Cloudflare products are in beta, participants on the Startup Plan are welcome to share their use case and potentially receive early access.</p>
