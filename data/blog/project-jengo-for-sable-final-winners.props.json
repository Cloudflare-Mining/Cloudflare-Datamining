In 2021, fifteen years after buying the patents, Sable filed suit asserting these patents against a huge swath of companies: Cloudflare, Cisco, Fortinet, Check Point, SonicWall, Juniper Networks, and others. Sable knew that, no matter how weak its case, companies were likely to pay it just to avoid the considerable cost and trouble of litigating. </p><p>Cloudflare doesn’t pay trolls for meritless patent claims. Rather than paying off Sable to make the suit go away, we aggressively litigated the case, knocking out nearly <b>100 claims</b> spanning <b>4 patents</b>. By the time we got to trial, just a <b>single claim</b> was left.</p><p>At trial, the jury’s verdict was decisive. After just <b>2 hours</b> of deliberating, the jury found that Cloudflare didn’t infringe the remaining live claim (claim 25 of the ’919 patent). The jury then went on to <i>also </i>find that claim 25 was invalid in the first place. </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3AOcLxu1X8ziNdWTJIiSIz/6bbb3544996cba99294bb561edc52991/1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"509\" height=\"321\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2EHcDi1tfbZNb3CvEAetvy/fda5c4947f4d5e7e177e954a08a44d6d/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"509\" height=\"263\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>In fact, Cloudflare’s victory was so complete that Sable didn’t bother appealing. Instead, Sable agreed to pay <i>Cloudflare</i> $225,000. In other words, not only did Sable miss out on its payday, it had to pay up for its failed litigation. </p><p>Even better, Sable granted Cloudflare a royalty-free license to its entire patent portfolio and dedicated all of its patents to the public, meaning Sable can no longer use these patents to profit off of frivolous lawsuits. This case, and Cloudflare’s aggressive defense, put Sable out of the patent troll business for good. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"announcing-the-final-project-jengo-winners\">Announcing the final Project Jengo winners</h3>\n      <a href=\"#announcing-the-final-project-jengo-winners\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>With the Sable litigation resolved, it’s time to close out the Project Jengo contest!</p><p>Project Jengo is our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/sable-prior-art-search/\"><u>prior art bounty program</u></a>.

Since retiring, he has been using Cloudflare for his blog. </p><p>After seeing Project Jengo on Hacker News, he decided to join in. He was particularly motivated because of the similar trends he sees within the pharmaceutical industry, of intellectual property (IP) profiteering displacing innovative R&amp;D efforts. He explained: </p><blockquote><p><i>The challenge faced by Cloudflare is close to my heart. … Cloudflare is facing an entity which is unreasonably stretching the meaning of their patent claims.</i></p></blockquote><p>Jean-Pierre applied his patent expertise (he wrote 12 patents related to online authentication and identity management in the 2000s) to the Sable case. He followed a methodical process, preparing “two conceptual trees, one started from Sable patents and expanded with possible prior arts, and the other” from the asserted claims. Jean-Pierre ultimately prepared a 24-page submission, including a meticulously detailed claim chart, identifying prior art challenging the ’431 patent asserted against Cloudflare (titled “Micro-Flow Management” and concerning Internet switching technology for network service providers).

But when he saw Project Jengo on Cloudflare’s website, that didn’t stop him from deciding to take a stab at it. We’re glad he did! As we described in our prior <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/three-new-winners-of-project-jengo-and-more-defeats-for-the-patent-troll/\"><u>post</u></a> about Peter’s submission, the ʼ593 patent is the Sable patent concerning the detection of “bad” flows. Peter’s prior art reference developed the same thing <i>five years earlier</i>: “This thesis studies a means of using such mechanisms to identify nonadaptive [what Sable calls ‘bad’] network flows, and proposes a protocol to push this information, along with penalization responsibility, towards the flows’ sources.” Since Yang’s <a href=\"https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47543/40470984-MIT.pdf\"><u>work</u></a> predates the ’593 patent’s alleged new solutions by years, this was a great find.</p><p>Jatin, a computer science analyst who also discovered Project Jengo while reading Cloudflare’s blog, submitted two pieces of prior art. As we noted in the Chapter Eight <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/patent-troll-sable-pays-up/#we-are-thrilled-to-announce-the-winners-of-chapters-7-and-8\"><u>post</u></a>, they were particularly good references for Sable’s ’919 patent (the one patent that remained contested at trial).</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"in-other-troll-related-news\">In other troll-related news…</h3>\n      <a href=\"#in-other-troll-related-news\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>And there’s more! On the heels of the Sable litigation coming to a close, another troll filed but promptly abandoned its case against Cloudflare after realizing what it would have been up against. </p><p>Patent troll Touchpoint Projections Innovations sued Cloudflare in May 2024. Cloudflare was clear from the start that we would not back down. Several months later, when the case was still in its early stages, we published our blog post about Sable’s total capitulation — paying Cloudflare and getting out of the patent troll game. </p><p>Just <i>two weeks later</i>, Touchpoint voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice. The “with prejudice” language means it’s final, and that the case can’t restart at any point in the future. In other words, Touchpoint threw in the towel before things had really gotten started. </p><p>Sure, the timing could be coincidental. But we have a hunch that when Touchpoint realized what they’d be up against, they took a hard look at their case, and decided it just wasn’t worth it.</p><p>We’ve seen this pattern before. Back in 2022, PacSec3 LLC accused Cloudflare of patent infringement. But after we made clear our intention to fight back, PacSec3 called it quits, dismissing its case.</p><p>Cloudflare’s trial victories and Project Jengo are sending a clear message to patent trolls. We’re not afraid of a fight! We hope other trolls take note and find other, more productive, avenues for their efforts.  </p>",
