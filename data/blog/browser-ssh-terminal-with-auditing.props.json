Cloudflare’s network will accelerate their connection, apply rules about what data transfers can take place, and record the session for administrators to audit as needed.</p><p>We built Cloudflare’s browser-based terminal based on conversations with customers who are struggling to secure and deliver applications that live outside of the browser. We heard from developers who had to deal with using, and supporting, existing workflows to connect over SSH into machines or extend legacy applications to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/remote-workforces/\">large, remote workforces</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2OEPZ22ETbr5FjPuFmwNXN/7d96ebdceb5b94c19326b2b54be83f44/image5-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1768\" height=\"968\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We’re starting with a terminal for SSH use cases, but Cloudflare’s platform will provide a browser-based interface for nearly any application that your team needs. Your security team can create Zero Trust rules to determine who can reach those resources and how — while logging every connection.

Web applications that used to live on a private network can be deployed behind a reverse proxy, like Cloudflare, and users can visit a public DNS address in any web browser while the reverse proxy checks for identity. Cloudflare Access builds on these tools to give your team the ability to add Zero Trust rules to any web application in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>Non-web applications introduce challenges. Most traditional applications that require a thick client rely on private networks. The client software expects to reach a private IP, over a specific protocol, and making that IP public is a non-starter for almost all organizations because of the risk of data loss. Even if it were public, end users would still need to run client software on their device.</p><p>Authentication to those applications also relies on legacy approaches. Developers hold long-lived SSH keys to reach machines and business users keep usernames and passwords on sticky notes for RDP sessions. These types of resources make it difficult or impossible to integrate with your SSO provider and other controls like device posture.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"data-security-and-logging\">Data security and logging</h3>\n            <a href=\"#data-security-and-logging\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>You can also use Cloudflare to log every authentication event and HTTP request and response without any server-side code changes.

With Cloudflare Access, your team can use the second factor authentication of your identity provider as a requirement to reach applications of any type in a matter of minutes.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2nSapV6PtHLHRMLR9qd8cS/f72ba3bebf135e2dc82c886f6b2f1a97/image1-21.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1856\" height=\"1131\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>You can layer these types of identity-based rules with other signals, like the country where the user sits or the <a href=\"/endpoint-partnerships/\">health of the device</a> using integrations with Tanium, Carbon Black, Crowdstrike, and other providers. Organizations can require that users only <a href=\"/zero-trust-with-managed-devices/\">connect from corporate devices</a> or build login flows that support enterprise providers like Okta and Azure AD alongside public authentication options like GitHub and Google.</p><p>Cloudflare’s Zero Trust platform also helps your team get rid of outdated authentication processes like long-lived SSH security keys. The solution takes the JSON Web Token issued during the login and converts it to short-lived certificates that authorize the user’s session on a machine.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"audit-sessions-and-secure-data-in-every-application\">Audit sessions and secure data in every application</h3>\n            <a href=\"#audit-sessions-and-secure-data-in-every-application\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Cloudflare Zero Trust Apps platform gives your team the same level of control over files, data, and even commands that you have today in Cloudflare Gateway and applies it to any supported application type in your enterprise.</p><p>First, your team can now build rules that control who in your organization can transfer data to or away from a machine over an SSH connection or to a remote desktop over RDP.
