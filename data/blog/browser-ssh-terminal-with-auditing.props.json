Web applications that used to live on a private network can be deployed behind a reverse proxy, like Cloudflare, and users can visit a public DNS address in any web browser while the reverse proxy checks for identity. Cloudflare Access builds on these tools to give your team the ability to add Zero Trust rules to any web application in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>Non-web applications introduce challenges. Most traditional applications that require a thick client rely on private networks. The client software expects to reach a private IP, over a specific protocol, and making that IP public is a non-starter for almost all organizations because of the risk of data loss. Even if it were public, end users would still need to run client software on their device.</p><p>Authentication to those applications also relies on legacy approaches. Developers hold long-lived SSH keys to reach machines and business users keep usernames and passwords on sticky notes for RDP sessions. These types of resources make it difficult or impossible to integrate with your SSO provider and other controls like device posture.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"data-security-and-logging\">Data security and logging</h3>\n      <a href=\"#data-security-and-logging\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>You can also use Cloudflare to log every authentication event and HTTP request and response without any server-side code changes.

Build rules by machine, user and group identity, or country and device. Keep data on the machines or desktops in your environments and off of the roaming devices outside of your organization.</p><p>Coming soon, deploy a high visibility solution with low effort by enabling session recording for any connection type. Cloudflare Zero Trust Apps will record the screen of any session, batch the recordings in intervals, and send them to a storage location you have configured. We’ll be adding structured command logging and keyboard input to this flow as well.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"launch-any-app-with-a-single-click\">Launch any app with a single click</h3>\n      <a href=\"#launch-any-app-with-a-single-click\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Today’s launch not only <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/\">improves security for any application</a> in your organization, it also makes life easier for all of your users.</p><p>The browser-based interface of Cloudflare Zero Trust Apps can be launched from a single dashboard that is tailored to the permissions of each end user.

Cloudflare’s Zero Trust login flow authorizes them to the session and they can begin doing their work without modifying SSH configuration files or editing RDP clients locally.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 62.5%;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframe.videodelivery.net/9e62cddf4ac40dc7237f4136f946fa12?preload=true&loop=true&autoplay=true\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\"  allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Mobile also just works.

Cloudflare Zero Trust Apps renders the application in the browser as if it were a native application. Users can highlight, copy-and-paste, and use shortcuts.</p><p>Next, the solution uses Cloudflare’s network to accelerate traffic from the server to your end user. Cloudflare determines the fastest path across our global backbone and delivers the experience to your team from a data center nearby in more than 200 cities in over 100 countries.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Today’s launch begins with support for SSH.
