The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions.</p><p>We have been publishing these summaries since the first quarter of 2022, and over that time, the charts on Cloudflare Radar have evolved. Many of the traffic graphs in early editions of this summary were screenshots from the relevant traffic pages on Radar. Late last year, we launched the ability to download graphs, and earlier this year, to embed dynamic graphs, and these summaries have taken advantage of those capabilities where possible. Sharp-eyed readers may notice an additional evolution in some of the graphs below: yellow highlighting indicating an observed “traffic anomaly”. Identification of such anomalies, along with the ability to be notified about them, as well as a timeline enhancement (embedded below) to the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center/\">Cloudflare Radar Outage Center</a>, were launched as part of Birthday Week at the end of September. More information on these new features can be found in our <a href=\"/traffic-anomalies-notifications-radar/\">announcement blog post</a>.</p><p>As we have seen in previous quarters, Iraq pursued an aggressive plan of <a href=\"#governmentdirected\">government-directed</a> Internet shutdowns intended to prevent cheating on exams, and several other African countries implemented politically motivated shutdowns. <a href=\"#cablecuts\">Damage</a> to several submarine cables, as well as <a href=\"#maintenance\">planned maintenance</a> to others, caused Internet disruptions across a number of countries during the third quarter. Natural disasters, including <a href=\"#fire\">wildfires</a> and an <a href=\"#earthquake\">earthquake</a>, caused issues with connectivity, as did <a href=\"#poweroutages\">power outages</a> in multiple countries. An acknowledged <a href=\"#cyberattack\">cyberattack</a> resulted in a major US university intentionally disconnecting from the Internet, while a number of other major Internet providers <a href=\"#unspecifiedissues\">acknowledged problems</a> on their networks without ever disclosing the root cause of those problems.</p><p><i>(Note that the Internet disruptions related to the Israel/Palestine conflict are not covered in this post, as they began on October 7 in Q4 of 2023.
