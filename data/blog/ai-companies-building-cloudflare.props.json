It’s an exciting moment that, for the first time ever, we can now dynamically generate, deploy, and test code to meet specific user needs or integrations. This kind of flexibility is crucial to create a tool like Azule that is designed to meet this demand, offering a platform that can handle complex requirements and provide flexible integration options with other tools.</p><p>The AI space is evolving quickly and that applies to the rapid evolution of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-agentic-ai/\">AI agent</a> design patterns. These are essentially frameworks built upon LLM APIs, and they&#39;re showing immense potential. Azule effectively allows users to create AI agents which interact with their customers on behalf of their business. It&#39;s not just about addressing customer service queries anymore – AI agents can perform significant, ongoing tasks across various industries.</p><p>Azule is built entirely on Cloudflare, except for API calls to OpenAI.</p><p>The application relies on multiple Developer Platform and Cloudflare products and services.  Durable Objects and websockets are used for live chat.</p><blockquote><p><i>“Durable Objects enabled us to build our MVP faster than we could have on any other platform, thanks to Cloudflare&#39;s thoughtful product design.” - </i><b><i>Logan Grasby</i></b></p></blockquote><p>Other products used by Azule:</p><ul><li><p>Queues for data processing.</p></li><li><p>R2 for all data storage, including vector storage. Instead of using a vector database service, Azule relies entirely on Cloudflare&#39;s R2 and cache API for on-disk vector search.</p></li><li><p>Workers KV for storing frequently accessed configuration data.</p></li><li><p>D1 was implemented for their user database.</p></li><li><p>Constellation (now Workers AI) for various labeling and summarization tasks.</p></li><li><p>Workers for Platforms allows Azule AI to write and deploy custom features for the users.</p></li><li><p>Pages for hosting our landing page and marketing content.</p></li></ul><p>Other valuable features used include API shield, email workers, the mail channels integration for email, log push, outbound workers, among others!</p><blockquote><p><i>“I firmly believe that AI agents are at home on the web. Everything Cloudflare builds has web optimization in mind and so it only makes sense to invest in the platform. By building on Cloudflare, we&#39;ve made significant cost reductions, particularly by moving all our search solutions to R2. For example, many of our users want to store large datasets on Azule and make them searchable through their agents. Our previous search solutions, based on Pinecone and Milisearch, would have cost thousands of dollars per month to store and search through just one customer&#39;s data. With Cloudflare&#39;s R2 and cache API, we can now enable our customer&#39;s AI agent to comb through large datasets in less than 900ms, at a fraction of the cost.” - </i><b><i>Logan Grasby</i></b></p></blockquote>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"42able-ai\">42able.ai</h3>\n            <a href=\"#42able-ai\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><a href=\"http://42able.ai\">42able</a>, headquartered in Wales, UK, is at the forefront of AI-driven solutions, dedicated to revolutionizing engagement with business documents. Through cutting-edge technology and innovative strategies, the company seeks to streamline, enhance, and redefine the way businesses interact with their documents.</p><p>The modern business landscape is inundated with vast volumes of documents, from contracts and reports to invoices and internal communications. Navigating, understanding, and extracting value from these documents can be time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires significant manual effort.</p><p>42able envisions a future where business documents are not just static pieces of information but dynamic assets that businesses can engage with interactively, efficiently, and intelligently.</p><blockquote><p><i>“Launching an AI product has come with many unique challenges and uncertainties. Users expect AI to be perfect or near-perfect, and are much less forgiving of an AI making an error compared to a human making the same mistake. Decisions about how AI systems should act often involve moral or ethical judgments, which might not be straightforward and can be subject to societal debates. Training and deploying AI models is challenging. Cloudflare&#39;s solutions are making it much easier, than managing all the individual parts ourselves.” - </i><b><i>James Finney</i></b></p></blockquote><p>42able chose Cloudflare for fantastic performance in comparison to other cloud providers, in part due to the no cold boot times, competitive pricing, ease of use, fantastic local development features, and brilliant support.

Finally, security is embedded into Cloudflare through the Zero Trust platform that enable us to secure both production but also the lower environments including the secured access to internal systems and apps.” - </i><b><i>Laurent Christen</i></b></p></blockquote>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"chainfuse\">Chainfuse</h3>\n            <a href=\"#chainfuse\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6CFJMgydVjnLPp44ap9Ri/0740b60ddea4dc49031335f7f9c55d69/image5-8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"https://www.chainfuse.com\">ChainFuse</a>, based in San Francisco, CA, is a multichannel AI platform that assists organizations in collecting and analyzing user feedback on a large scale. Their AI-powered community tool aids support, community, and product teams in garnering valuable insights, facilitating more informed product decisions.</p><blockquote><p><i>“We have used Google Cloud and AWS, but our experience with Cloudflare has particularly stood out. Since 2016, we have consistently chosen Cloudflare for our projects due to their excellent product range and reliable performance. Saying &quot;it just works&quot; is an understatement.” - </i><b><i>Victor Sanchez</i></b></p></blockquote><p>ChainFuse relies on Workers for the core of their backend infrastructure and a range of our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/\">security solutions</a> to secure their applications and employees. WAF and its vast adaptability is a major defense, blocking an average of 48% of all incoming traffic, effectively weeding out known malicious traffic. Additionally, it employs rate limiting to prevent abuse. API Shield, used in conjunction with WAF, intercepts an average of 1.32% of the incoming traffic that manages to bypass WAF. The Zero Trust Gateway not only secures their employees but also is integrated into their product to prevent end users from exploiting the platform for malicious purposes.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"ai-moda\">ai.moda</h3>\n            <a href=\"#ai-moda\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.ai.moda/en/?utm_source=cloudflare&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=ai&utm_content=highlight\">ai.moda</a>, headquartered in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, is building multiple AI tools with a focus on helping bridge humans, developers, and machines together.
