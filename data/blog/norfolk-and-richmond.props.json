In the early 1990’s, MAE-East (Metropolitan-Area-Exchange East) , an Internet Exchange Point (IXP) was established. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAE-East\">MAE-East</a> and West were some of the earliest <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_exchange_point\">IXPs</a>. Internet Exchange Points are crucial interconnection points for ISPs and other Internet Networks to interconnect and exchange traffic. Eco-systems have grown around these through new data center offerings and new Internet platforms. Like many pieces of the Internet, MAE-East had <a href=\"https://www.parking.org/2017/09/05/internet-began-parking-garage/\">a humble beginning</a>, though not many humble beginnings grew to handle around 50% of Internet traffic exchange.<br><br>Cloudflare’s second Data Center, and one that still plays a critical component in our <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com/network-map\">Global Network</a> was Ashburn, Virginia. Similarly across many organizations, the Northern Virginia area has become a Data Center mecca. Many of the largest Clouds have a substantial amount of their footprint in Northern Virginia. Although MAE-East no longer exists, other Internet Exchange Points have come and grown in its place. <br><br>Cloudflare’s network has grown beyond what was traditional Interconnection points, like Ashburn/Northern VA, to a new Edge of the network. Cloudflare will continue to grow its Edge closer to every end-user, so today we’re announcing our Richmond and Norfolk data centers. These two data centers will cover much more of Virginia and neighboring regions.</p>",
