	<p>On April 7, A <a href="https://www.meetup.com/scrappystartup/" target="_blank">Scrappy Startup Forum</a> held their monthly lunch at the CloudFlare loft. More than 60 people showed up for the event.</p>
	<p>Startups like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://www.dishcrawl.com/" target="_blank">Dishcrawl</a>, <a href="http://www.tapviva.com/" target="_blank">Tapviva</a>, <a href="http://www.redbeacon.com/" target="_blank">Redbeacon</a> and <a href="http://www.spotsift.com/Home.html" target="_blank">SpotSift</a> exchanged ideas over some cheesy <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/toastymelts" target="_blank">Toasty Melts</a> and pork sliders from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/good-foods-catering-san-francisco-2" target="_blank">Good Foods Catering</a>. It was a great way to meet many of our SOMA neighbors.</p>
	<p>CloudFlare looks forward to hosting another Scrappy Startup lunch, along with a few other <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/meet-up-with-cloudflare">meet-ups</a>, in the near future.</p>
