Unsurprisingly, customers consistently ask us how they can optimize their cache performance to get the most out of Cloudflare.</p><p>With Cache Analytics, it’s easier than ever to learn how to speed up your website, and reduce traffic sent to your origin. Some of my favorite capabilities include:</p><ul><li><p>See what resources are missing from cache, expired, or never eligible for cache in the first place</p></li><li><p>Slice and dice your data as you see fit: filter by hostnames, or see a list of top URLs that miss cache</p></li><li><p>Switch between views of requests and data Transfer to understand both performance and cost</p></li></ul>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6stMyGTJsZvF3WxgPuGxoF/1be704ee786f7c5dd57cc6691160d523/image6-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1504\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>An overview of Cache Analytics</p><p><b>Cache Analytics is available today for all customers on our Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans.</b></p><p>In this blog post, I’ll explain why we built Cache Analytics and how you can get the most out of it.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"why-do-we-need-analytics-focused-on-caching\">Why do we need analytics focused on caching?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#why-do-we-need-analytics-focused-on-caching\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>If you want to scale the delivery of a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/\">fast, high-performance website</a>, then caching is critical. Caching has two main goals:</p><p>First, caching improves <b>performance</b>. Cloudflare data centers are within 100ms of 90% of the planet; putting your content in Cloudflare’s cache gets it <i>physically</i> closer to your customers and visitors, meaning that visitors will see your website <i>faster</i> when they request it! (Plus, reading assets on our edge SSDs is really fast, rather than waiting for origins to generate a response.)</p><p>Second, caching helps <b>reduce bandwidth costs</b> associated with operating a presence on the Internet**.** Origin data transfer is one of the biggest expenses of running a web service, so serving content out of Cloudflare’s cache can significantly reduce costs incurred by origin infrastructure.</p><p>Because it’s not safe to cache all content (we wouldn’t want to cache your bank balance by default), Cloudflare relies on customers to tell us what’s safe to cache with <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003206852-Understanding-Origin-Cache-Control\">HTTP Cache-Control headers</a> and <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021023712-Best-Practices-Speed-up-your-Site-with-Custom-Caching-via-Cloudflare-Page-Rules\">page rules</a>. But even with page rules, it can be hard to understand what’s actually getting cached — or more importantly, what’s <i>not</i> getting cached, and why. Is a resource expired? Or was it even eligible for cache in the first place?</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"faster-or-cheaper-why-not-both\">Faster or cheaper?

Data transfer is useful for understanding <i>cost</i>, because most hosts charge for every byte that leaves their network — every gigabyte served by Cloudflare translates into money saved at the origin.</p><p>You can always toggle between these two views while keeping filters enabled.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"a-filter-for-every-occasion\">A filter for every occasion</h2>\n            <a href=\"#a-filter-for-every-occasion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Let’s say you’re focused on improving the performance of a specific subdomain on your zone.

Fixing this is one of the fastest ways to reduce origin data transfer cost.</p></li><li><p><b><b><b>Revalidated</b></b></b> indicates content that was expired, but after Cloudflare checked the origin, it was still fresh! If you see a lot of revalidated content, it’s a good sign you should increase your Edge Cache TTLs through a <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411427#summary-of-page-rules-settings\">page rule</a> or <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003206852-Understanding-Origin-Cache-Control\">max-age origin directive</a>.

We’re planning to add more dimensions to drill into the data. And we’re planning to add even more essential statistics — for example, about how cache keys are being used.</p><p>Finally, I’m really excited about Cache Analytics because it shows what we have in store for Cloudflare Analytics more broadly. We know that you’ve asked for many features— like per-hostname analytics, or the ability to see top URLs — for a long time, and we’re hard at work on bringing these to Zone Analytics. Stay tuned!</p>",
