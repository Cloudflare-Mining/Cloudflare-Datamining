It was originally detected in late June 2021 by <a href=\"https://blog.qrator.net/en/meris-botnet-climbing-to-the-record_142/\">QRator</a> in joint research they conducted with Yandex. Their initial research identified 30,000 to 56,000 bots, but they estimated that the numbers are actually much higher, in the ballpark of 250,000 bots.</p><p>The Meris botnet is formed of infected routers and networking hardware manufactured by the Latvian company MikroTik. <a href=\"https://blog.mikrotik.com/security/meris-botnet.html\">According to MikroTik’s</a> blog, the attackers exploited a vulnerability in the router’s operating system (RouterOS) which enabled attackers to gain unauthenticated remote access to read and write arbitrary files (<a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14847\">CVE-2018-14847</a>).</p><p><a href=\"https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:RouterOS_FAQ#What_is_MikroTik_RouterOS.E2.84.A2.3F\">RouterOS</a> is the router operating system that’s used by MikroTik’s routers and the RouterBOARD hardware product family, which can also be used to turn any PC into a router. Administration of RouterOS can be done either via direct <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/\">SSH connection</a> or by using a configuration utility called <a href=\"https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Winbox#Summary\">WinBox</a>. The vulnerability itself was possible due to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_traversal_attack\">directory traversal</a> vulnerability in the WinBox interface with RouterOS.</p><p>Directory traversal is a type of exploit that allows attackers to travel to the parent directories to gain access to the operating system’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system\">file system</a>, a method and structure of how data is stored and retrieved in the operating system. Once they gain access to the file system, attackers can then read the existing files that administer the router and write files directly into the file system to administer the routers to their botnet needs.</p><p>While the vulnerability was patched after its detection back in 2018, it’s still being exploited in compromised devices that do not use the patched RouterOS versions, or that use the default usernames and passwords. MicroTik has advised its customers to upgrade their devices’ OS version, to only allow access to the devices via secure IPsec, and to inspect for any abnormalities such as unknown SOCKS proxy settings and scripts.</p><p>To launch volumetric attacks, the botnet uses HTTP pipelining which allows it to send multiple requests over a single connection, thus increasing its total attack throughput. Furthermore, in an attempt to obfuscate the attack source, the botnet uses open SOCKS proxies to proxy their attack traffic to the target.</p><p>Cloudflare’s DDoS protection systems automatically detect and mitigate Meris attacks. One of the mitigation actions that the system can choose to use is the ‘Connection Close’ action which eliminates the risk of HTTP pipelining and helps slow down attackers. Additionally, as part of Cloudflare’s threat intelligence suite, we provide a Managed IP List of Open SOCKS Proxies that customers can use as part of their firewall rules — to block, challenge or rate-limit traffic that arrives via SOCKS proxies.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-does-meris-compare-to-mirai\">How does Meris compare to Mirai?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-does-meris-compare-to-mirai\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>About five years ago, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/\">Mirai</a> (Japanese for future) — the infamous botnet that infected hundreds of thousands of IoT devices —  <a href=\"/inside-mirai-the-infamous-iot-botnet-a-retrospective-analysis/\">launched record-breaking DDoS attacks</a> against websites.</p><p>There have been many variants of the Mirai botnet since its source code was leaked.

During our analysis of the Meris botnet attacks, our security experts noticed the attack vectors adapt to try and bypass Cloudflare’s defenses. Needless to say, they were not successful. But we wanted to stay many steps ahead of attackers — and so our engineers deployed additional rules that mitigate Meris attacks even more comprehensively. A side effect of these mitigation rules is that it also provides us with more granular threat intelligence on the Meris attacks.</p><p>Since we deployed the new rules in early August, we’ve seen Meris launch an average of 104 DDoS attacks on Cloudflare customers every day. The highest figure we’ve seen was on September 6, when Meris was used to launch 261 unique attacks against Cloudflare customers.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6TtZZ2lzrszMdx8N3fhjp4/6bdfaba64b916e35235136ac8be75fda/unnamed--8-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>View the interactive graph on</i> <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/notebooks/meris-botnet#meris_attacks_over_time\"><i>Cloudflare Radar</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>During that same day, on September 6, attacks from Meris accounted for a record-breaking 17.5% of all L7 DDoS attacks that Cloudflare observed.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3OP78KrTmwCcDv1W1n6jPr/f1ea42eb24f867c74eff3289d16941de/unnamed--1--3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>View the interactive graph on </i><a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/notebooks/meris-botnet#share_of_meris_attacks\"><i>Cloudflare Radar</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>Overall, Meris targets about 50 different websites and applications every single day.

A second significant wave against the same industry was launched in early September.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2Ch2h4SDn7AL79q3sLbr7m/deb98d1529f528523b70bf6818d13bd4/unnamed--3--3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>View the interactive graph on </i><a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/notebooks/meris-botnet#top10_industries_attacked_by_meris\"><i>Cloudflare Radar</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"meris-targets-websites-in-china-australia-and-us\">Meris targets websites in China, Australia, and US</h2>\n      <a href=\"#meris-targets-websites-in-china-australia-and-us\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Similarly to the analysis of the top industries, we can calculate the Meris DDoS activity rate per target country to identify which countries came under the most attacks.
