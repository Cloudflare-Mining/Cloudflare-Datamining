	<p>We are excited to add four new data centers this week to Cloudflare's growing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/" target="_blank">network</a>, beginning with Colombo, Sri Lanka. This deployment is our 112th data center globally, and our 38th in Asia.<br></p>

	<p>Six million Internet properties using Cloudflare are now even faster across the island country of Sri Lanka. Previously, local visitors to Cloudflare customers were served out of our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-singapore-data-center-now-online/">Singapore</a> or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/middle-east-expansion/">Dubai</a> data centers.<br></p>

	<p>Sri Lanka added over one million Internet users in the past year alone. At ~30% Internet penetration, there is considerable room to grow.</p>
