	<p>Cloudflare recently moved to County Hall, the building just behind the London Eye. We have a very large event space which we would love to open up to the developer community. If you organize technical meetups, we'd love to host you. If you attend technical meetups, please share this post with the meetup organizers.</p>

	<p>Our Auditorium is large enough to hold up to 250 attendees, but can also host a small group as well. It may be used for talks, workshops, panels, networking sessions, and more.</p>
	<p>There is a large entry way for people coming into our 6th floor lobby where check-in may be managed. Once inside the event space, you will see a large, open kitchen area which can be used to set up event food and beverages. Beyond that is Cloudflare's All-Hands Auditorium space, which may be used for your events.</p>
	<p>We have several gender-neutral toilets for your guests' use as well.</p>
	<h4>Lobby</h4>
	<p>You may welcome your guests here. The event space is just to the left of this spot.</p>

	<h4>Set-up</h4>
	<p>We can rearrange seating, based on the format of your meetup or event. The most common set-ups are Theatre Seating (chairs only, facing the video wall) and Workshop Seating (tables &amp; chairs, facing the video wall).</p>

	<h4>Food &amp; beverage</h4>
	<p>Cloudflare will gladly provide light snacks and beverages including beer, wine or cider, and sodas or juices we have in our kitchen area. You are welcome to order additional food if you can be present to receive it and set it up. (We recommend appetizers/food that can be kept at room temperature, since we do not allow open-flame sternos.)</p>
	<p>If your meetup is eligible, we may even be able to sponsor your additional food orders. Check out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvJjiS1iuzf_XYNaah20xTwNfjcBQeiqjmrHi9CEFWM/edit?usp=sharing">pizza reimbursement rules</a> for more details.</p>
