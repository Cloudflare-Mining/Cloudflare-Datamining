Because of this breach, someone outside Cloudflare got access to our Salesforce instance, which we use for customer support and internal customer case management, and some of the data it contains. Most of this information is customer contact information and basic support case data, but some customer support interactions may reveal information about a customer&#39;s configuration and could contain sensitive information like access tokens. Given that Salesforce support case data contains the contents of support tickets with Cloudflare, any information that a customer may have shared with Cloudflare in our support system—including logs, tokens or passwords—should be considered compromised, and we strongly urge you to rotate any credentials that you may have shared with us through this channel. </p><p>As part of our response to this incident, we did our own search through the compromised data to look for tokens or passwords and found 104 Cloudflare API tokens. We have identified no suspicious activity associated with those tokens, but all of these have been rotated in an abundance of caution. All customers whose data was compromised in this breach have been informed directly by Cloudflare.</p><p>No Cloudflare services or infrastructure were compromised as a result of this breach.</p><p>We are responsible for the choice of tools we use in support of our business. This breach has let our customers down. For that, we sincerely apologize. The rest of this blog gives a detailed timeline and detailed information on how we investigated this breach.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"the-salesloft-drift-breach\">The Salesloft Drift breach</h2>\n      <a href=\"#the-salesloft-drift-breach\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Last week, Cloudflare became aware of suspicious activity within our Salesforce tenant and learned that we, as well as hundreds of other companies, had become the target of a threat actor that was able to successfully exfiltrate the text fields of support cases from our Salesforce instance. Our security team immediately began an investigation, cut off the threat actor’s access, and took a number of steps, detailed below, to secure our environment. We are writing this blog to detail what happened, how we responded, and to help our customers and others understand how to protect themselves from this incident.</p><p>Cloudflare uses Salesforce to keep track of who our customers are and how they use our services, and we use it as a support tool to interact with our customers. An important detail to understand as part of this incident is that the threat actor only accessed data in Salesforce “cases,” which may be created when Cloudflare sales and support team members need to comment to each other internally in order to support our customers; they are also created when customers interact with Cloudflare support. Salesforce had an integration with the Salesloft Drift chatbot, which Cloudflare used to give anyone who visited our website a way to contact us.</p><p>As Salesloft has <a href=\"https://trust.salesloft.com/?uid=Drift%2FSalesforce+Security+Update\"><u>announced</u></a>, a threat actor breached their systems. As part of the breach, the threat actor was able to obtain OAuth credentials associated with the Salesloft Drift chat agent’s Salesforce integration to exfiltrate data from Salesloft customers’ Salesforce instances. Our investigation revealed that this was part of a sophisticated supply chain attack targeting business-to-business third-party integrations, affecting hundreds of organizations globally that were customers of Salesloft. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/application-services/products/cloudforceone/\"><u>Cloudforce One</u></a>—Cloudflare’s threat intelligence &amp; research team—has classified the advanced threat actor as <b>GRUB1</b>. Additional disclosures from <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/data-theft-salesforce-instances-via-salesloft-drift\"><u>Google’s Threat Intelligence Group</u> </a>aligned with the activity we observed in our environment.</p><p>Our investigation showed the threat actor compromised and exfiltrated data from our Salesforce tenant between August 12-17, 2025, following initial reconnaissance observed on August 9, 2025. A detailed analysis confirmed the exposure was limited to Salesforce case objects, which primarily consist of customer support tickets and their associated data within our Salesforce tenant. These case objects contain customer contact information related to the support case, case subject lines, and the body of the case correspondence—but <i>not</i> any attachments to the cases. Cloudflare does not request or require customers to share secrets, credentials, or API keys in support cases. However, in some troubleshooting scenarios, customers may paste keys, logs, or other sensitive information into the case text fields. Anything shared through this channel should now be considered compromised.</p><p>We believe this incident was not an isolated event but that the threat actor intended to harvest credentials and customer information for future attacks. Given that hundreds of organizations were affected through this Drift compromise, we suspect the threat actor will use this information to launch targeted attacks against customers across the affected organizations. </p><p>This post provides a timeline of the attack, details our response, and offers security recommendations to help other organizations mitigate similar threats.</p><p><i>Throughout this blog post, all dates and times are in UTC.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"cloudflares-response-and-remediation\">Cloudflare&#39;s response and remediation</h2>\n      <a href=\"#cloudflares-response-and-remediation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>When Salesforce and Salesloft notified us on August 23, 2025, that the Drift integration had been abused across multiple organizations, including Cloudflare, we immediately launched a company-wide Security Incident Response.

We launched our own comprehensive investigation and remediation effort.</p><p>Our first priority was cutting off GRUB1&#39;s access at the source. We disabled the Drift user account, revoked its client ID and secrets, and completely purged all Salesloft software and browser extensions from Cloudflare systems. This comprehensive removal mitigated the risk of the threat actor reusing compromised tokens, regaining access through stale sessions, or leveraging software extensions for persistence.\n\nSeparately, we expanded our security review to include all third-party services connected to our Salesforce environment, rotating credentials as a precautionary measure to prevent any potential lateral movement by the threat actor. </p><p>Since we use Salesforce as our primary tool for managing our customer support data, the risk was that customers had submitted secrets, passwords, or other sensitive data in their customer service requests. We needed to understand what sensitive material the attacker now had. </p><p>We immediately focused on whether any of that data could have been used to compromise our customers accounts, systems, or infrastructure. We examined the data obtained by the threat actor to see if it contained exposed credentials, since cases include freeform text fields where customers may submit Cloudflare API tokens, keys, or logs to our support team. Our teams developed custom scanning tools using regex, entropy, and pattern-matching techniques to detect likely Cloudflare secrets at scale. </p><p>Our investigation confirmed that the exposure was strictly limited to the freeform text in Salesforce case objects—not attachments or files. Cases are used by sales and support teams to communicate internally about customer support issues and to communicate directly with customers. As a result, these case objects contained text-only data consisting of:</p><ul><li><p>The subject line of the Salesforce case</p></li><li><p>The body of the case (freeform text which may include any correspondence including keys, secrets, etc., if provided by the customer to Cloudflare)</p></li><li><p>Customer contact information (for example, company name, requestor email address and phone number, company domain name, and company country)</p></li></ul><p>This conclusion was validated through extensive reviews of integrations, authentication activity, endpoint telemetry, and network logs.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"august-26-29-2025-scaling-the-response-and-proactive-measures\">August 26–29, 2025: Scaling the response and proactive measures</h3>\n      <a href=\"#august-26-29-2025-scaling-the-response-and-proactive-measures\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>While the primary Salesforce and Salesloft credentials had already been rotated, our next step was to terminate and securely re-establish our third-party integrations.

The data compromised across hundreds of companies targeted in this attack could be used to launch additional attacks. We strongly urge all organizations to adopt the following security measures:</p><ul><li><p><b>Disconnect Salesloft and its applications:</b> Immediately disconnect all Salesloft connections from your Salesforce environment and uninstall any related software or browser extensions.</p></li><li><p><b>Rotate credentials:</b> Reset the credentials for all third-party applications and integrations connected to your Salesforce instance. Rotate any credentials that may have been previously shared in a support case to Cloudflare. Based on the scope and intent of this attack, we also recommend rotating all third party credentials in your environment as well as any credentials that may have been included in a support case with any other vendor. </p></li><li><p><b>Implement frequent credential rotation:</b> Establish a regular rotation schedule for all API keys and other secrets used in your integrations to reduce the window of exposure.</p></li><li><p><b>Review support case data: </b>Review all customer support case data with your third-party providers to identify what sensitive information may have been exposed. Look for cases containing credentials, API keys, configuration details, or other sensitive data that customers may have shared. For Cloudflare customers specifically: you can access your support case history through the Cloudflare dashboard under Support &gt; Technical Support &gt; My Activities, where you can filter cases or use the &quot;Download Cases&quot; feature to conduct a comprehensive review.</p></li><li><p><b>Conduct forensics:</b> <b> </b>Review access logs and permissions to all third-party integrations and review <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/data-theft-salesforce-instances-via-salesloft-drift\"><u>public materials</u></a> associated with the Drift incident and conduct a security review of your environment as appropriate.</p></li><li><p><b>Enforce least privilege:</b> Audit all third-party applications to ensure they operate with the minimum level of access (least privilege) required for their function and ensure that admin accounts are not used for vendors.

Our team responded to the notice, and our investigation confirmed that the impact was strictly limited to data in Salesforce case objects, with no compromise of other Cloudflare systems or infrastructure.</p><p>That said, we consider the compromise of <i>any</i> data to be unacceptable. Our customers trust Cloudflare with their data, their infrastructure, and their security. In turn, we sometimes place our trust in third-party tools which need to be monitored and carefully scoped in what they can access. We are responsible for this. We let our customers down. For this, we sincerely apologize.</p><p>As third-party tools increasingly integrate with internal corporate data across the industry, we need to approach each new tool with careful scrutiny. This incident affected hundreds of organizations through a single integration point, highlighting the interconnected risks in today&#39;s technology landscape. We are committed to developing new capabilities to help us and our customers defend against such attacks in the future—stay tuned for announcements during Cloudflare&#39;s Birthday Week later this month.</p><p>We are also committed to sharing threat intelligence and research with the broader security community.
