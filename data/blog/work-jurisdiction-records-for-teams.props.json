Adding countries-by-day in the UI is in development and will be available later this quarter.</p><p>We wanted to close out Privacy &amp; Compliance Week by talking about something universal and certain: taxes. Businesses worldwide pay employment taxes based on where their employees do work. For most businesses and in normal times, where employees do work has been relatively easy to determine: it&#39;s where they come into the office. But 2020 has made everything more complicated, even taxes.</p><p>As businesses worldwide have shifted to remote work, employees have been working from &quot;home&quot; — wherever that may be. Some employees have taken this opportunity to venture further from where they usually are, sometimes crossing state and national borders.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6TwZjGkF8eO7yzI2rT8rmN/6d1fc61d676d92c005f2153644a4ba3a/facebook-shared-image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In a lot of ways, it&#39;s gone better than expected. We&#39;re proud of helping provide technology solutions like Cloudflare for Teams that allow employees to work from anywhere and ensure they still have a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/remote-workforces/\">fast, secure connection to their corporate resources</a>. But increasingly we&#39;ve been hearing from the heads of the finance, legal, and HR departments of our customers with a concern: &quot;If I don&#39;t know where my employees are, I have no idea where I need to pay taxes.&quot;</p><p>Today we&#39;re announcing the beta of a new feature for Cloudflare for Teams to help solve this problem: Workplace Records. Cloudflare for Teams uses Access and Gateway logs to provide the state and country from which employees are working. Workplace Records can be used to help finance, legal, and HR departments determine where payroll taxes are due and provide a record to defend those decisions.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"every-location-became-a-potential-workplace\">Every location became a potential workplace</h3>\n            <a href=\"#every-location-became-a-potential-workplace\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Before 2020, employees who frequently traveled could manage tax jurisdiction reporting by gathering plane tickets or keeping manual logs of where they spent time. It was tedious, for employees and our payroll team, but manageable.</p><p>The COVID pandemic transformed that chore into a significant challenge for our finance, legal, and HR teams. Our entire organization was suddenly forced to work remotely. If we couldn&#39;t get comfortable that we knew where people were working, we worried we may be forced to impose somewhat draconian rules requiring employees to check-in. That didn&#39;t seem very Cloudflare-y.</p><p>The challenge impacts individual team members as well. Reporting mistakes can lead to tax penalties for employees or amendments during filing season. Our legal team started to field questions from employees stuck in new regions because of travel restrictions. Our payroll team prepared for a backlog of amendments.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3iLks5EvgwrxIDURV0oxNh/77d67b1e208b64c55a33b730c2bd96ce/facebook-shared-image-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"logging-jurisdiction-without-manual-reporting\">Logging jurisdiction without manual reporting</h3>\n            <a href=\"#logging-jurisdiction-without-manual-reporting\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>When team members open their corporate laptops and start a workday, they log in to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/access/\">Cloudflare Access</a> — our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust</a> tool that protects applications and data.
