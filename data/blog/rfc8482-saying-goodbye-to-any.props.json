There are two problems with this notion.</p><p>First, it assumes the server is able to retrieve &quot;all records&quot;. In our implementation - we can&#39;t. Our DNS server, like many modern implementations, doesn&#39;t have a single &quot;zone&quot; file listing all properties of a DNS zone. This design allows us to respond fast and with information always up to date, but it makes it incredibly hard to retrieve &quot;all records&quot;. Correct handling of &quot;ANY&quot; adds unreasonable code complexity for an obscure, rarely used query type.</p><p>Second, many of the DNS responses are generated on-demand. To mention just two use cases:</p><ul><li><p>Some of our DNS responses <a href=\"/dnssec-done-right/\">are based on location</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"/black-lies/\">We are using black lies and DNS shotgun for DNSSEC</a></p></li></ul><p>Storing data in modern databases and dynamically generating responses poses a fundamental problem to ANY.</p><h1>ANY is hard for clients</h1><p>Around the same time a catastrophe happened - <a href=\"https://lists.dns-oarc.net/pipermail/dns-operations/2015-March/012899.html\">Firefox started shipping with DNS code issuing &quot;ANY&quot; types</a>. The intention was, as usual, benign. Firefox developers wanted to get the TTL value for A and AAAA queries.</p><p>To cite a DNS guru <a href=\"https://icannwiki.org/Andrew_Sullivan\">Andrew Sullivan</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In general, ANY is useful for troubleshooting but should never be usedfor regular operation. Its output is unpredictable given the effectsof caches. It can return enormous result sets.</p></blockquote><p>In user code you can&#39;t rely on anything sane to come out of an &quot;ANY&quot; query. While an &quot;ANY&quot; query has somewhat defined semantics on the DNS authoritative side, it&#39;s undefined on the DNS resolver side. Such a query can confuse the resolver:</p><ul><li><p>Should it forward the &quot;ANY&quot; query to authoritative?</p></li><li><p>Should it respond with any record that is already in cache?</p></li><li><p>Should it do some a mixture of the above behaviors?</p></li><li><p>Should it cache the result of &quot;ANY&quot; query and re-use the data for other queries?</p></li></ul><p>Different implementations do different things. &quot;ANY&quot; does not mean &quot;ALL&quot;, which is the main source of confusion. To our joy, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1093983#c14\">Firefox quickly backpedaled</a> on the change and stopped issuing ANY queries.</p><h1>ANY is hard for network operators</h1>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7FBoDQ01mFhkylbffAGioR/1d02cc870c7153a8960efdef5473fb6a/Screenshot-from-2019-03-15-14-44-58.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-from-2019-03-15-14-44-58\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1168\" height=\"308\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>A typical 50Gbps DNS amplification targeting one of our customers. The attack lasted about 4 hours.</p><p>Furthermore, since the &quot;ANY&quot; query can generate a large response, they were often used for DNS reflection attacks. Authoritative providers receive a spoofed ANY query and send the large answer to a target, potentially causing DoS damage. We have blogged about that many times:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"/the-ddos-that-knocked-spamhaus-offline-and-ho/\">The DDoS that knocked Spamhaus offline</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"/deep-inside-a-dns-amplification-ddos-attack/\">Deep inside a DNS amplification attack</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"/reflections-on-reflections/\">Reflections on reflections</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"/how-the-consumer-product-safety-commission-is-inadvertently-behind-the-internets-largest-ddos-attacks/\">How the CPSC is inadvertently behind the largest attacks</a></p></li></ul><p>The DoS problem with ANY is really old. Here is a discussion about a <a href=\"https://lists.dns-oarc.net/pipermail/dns-operations/2013-May/010178.html\">patch to bind tweaking ANY from 2013</a>.</p><p>There is also a second angle to the ANY DoS problem. Some reports suggested that performant DNS servers (authoritative or resolvers) <a href=\"https://fanf.livejournal.com/140566.html\">can fill their outbound network capacity</a> with a large number of ANY responses.</p><p>The recommendation is simple - network operators must use <a href=\"https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00994\">&quot;response rate limiting&quot;</a> when answering large DNS queries, otherwise they pose a DoS threat. The &quot;ANY&quot; query type just happens to often give such large responses, while providing little value to legitimate users.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"terminating-any\">Terminating ANY</h2>\n            <a href=\"#terminating-any\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>In 2015 frustrated with the experience we announced we would like to stop giving responses to &quot;ANY&quot; queries and wrote a (controversial at a time) blog post:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"/deprecating-dns-any-meta-query-type/\">Deprecating DNS ANY meta-query type</a></p></li></ul><p>A year later we followed up explaining possible solutions:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"/what-happened-next-the-deprecation-of-any/\">What happened next - the deprecation of ANY</a></p></li></ul><p>And here we come today!

Sometimes simple stuff like this matters most.</p><p>This opens a gate for implementers - we can prepare a simple answer to these queries. As an implementer you may stick &quot;A&quot;, or &quot;AAAA&quot; or anything else in the response if you wish.
