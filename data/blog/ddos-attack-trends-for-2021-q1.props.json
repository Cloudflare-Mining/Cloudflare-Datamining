During that week, our teams released a bunch of cool new products, including a bunch of <a href=\"/location-based-personalization-using-workers/\">improvements to Workers</a>. And it&#39;s not just our customers that love deploying apps with Workers, but also our engineering teams. Workers is also what powers our Internet traffic and attack trends on <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a>. Today, along with this deep-dive analysis blog, we’re excited to announce the new <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/notebooks/ddos\">Radar DDoS Report</a> page, our first fully automated data notebook built on top of <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter</a>, <a href=\"/explaining-cloudflares-abr-analytics/\">Clickhouse</a>, and <a href=\"https://workers.cloudflare.com/\">Workers</a>.</p><p>Last month, we introduced our <a href=\"/deep-dive-cloudflare-autonomous-edge-ddos-protection/\">autonomous edge DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection system</a> and explained how it is able to drop attacks at wire speed without impacting performance. It runs in our networks’ edge, analyzes traffic asynchronously to avoid impacting performance, and pushes mitigation rules in-line immediately once attacks are detected. All of this is done autonomously, i.e., without requiring centralized consensus.</p><p>Today, we’d like to share the latest DDoS insights and trends that are based on attacks that our system mitigated during the first quarter of 2021. When we analyze attacks, we calculate the “DDoS activity” rate, which is the percent of attack traffic out of the total traffic (attack + clean). This allows us to normalize the data points and avoid biases towards, for example, a data center that sees more traffic and therefore also more attacks.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"highlights\">Highlights</h2>\n            <a href=\"#highlights\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <h4>Application-layer DDoS attacks</h4><ul><li><p>In 2021 Q1, the country with the highest percentage of HTTP attack traffic was China.

One is the volume of traffic it delivers, measured as the bit rate (specifically, gigabits-per-second). Another is the number of packets it delivers, measured as the packet rate (specifically, packets-per-second). Attacks with high bit rates attempt to saturate the Internet link, while attacks with high packet rates attempt to overwhelm the routers or other in-line hardware devices.</p><p>In 2021 Q1, a vast majority (over 97%) of the L3/4 attacks observed were smaller than 1 mpps and 500 Mbps.</p><p>This is a continuation of the trend we observed all of last year. However, this does not imply that these attacks are harmless.</p><p>Attacks under 500 Mbps are often sufficient to create major disruptions for Internet properties that are not protected by a cloud-based DDoS protection service. Many organizations have uplinks provided by their service providers with less bandwidth capacity than 1 Gbps.

In 2021 Q1, SYN attacks continued to remain the most popular attack vector used by attackers, followed by RST, UDP, and DNS amplification attacks.</p><p>What is a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/\">SYN flood</a> attack? It’s a DDoS attack that exploits the very foundation of a TCP connection. A stateful TCP connection between a client and a server begins with a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/\">3-way TCP handshake</a>. The client sends an initial connection request packet with a synchronize flag (SYN). The server responds with a packet that contains a synchronized acknowledgment flag (SYN-ACK). Finally, the client responds with an acknowledgment (ACK) packet. At this point, a connection is established and data can be exchanged until the connection is closed. This stateful process can be abused by attackers to cause denial of service events.</p><p>By repeatedly sending SYN packets, the attacker attempts to overwhelm a server or the router’s connection table that tracks the state of TCP connections. The router replies with a SYN-ACK packet, allocates a certain amount of memory for each given connection, and falsely waits for the client to respond with the final ACK. Given a sufficient number of connections occupying the router’s memory, the router is unable to allocate more memory for legitimate clients, causing the router to crash or preventing it from handling legitimate client connections, i.e., a denial of service event.</p><p>Similarly, a RST amplification flood attack exhausts the target servers by depleting their system resources used to look up incoming packets for a current session.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3uURPZrVY130yaOVkCaHLI/58f535d22c101585894d6246f0e207d3/image5-10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1229\" height=\"410\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"emerging-threats\">Emerging threats</h3>\n            <a href=\"#emerging-threats\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6AVVildNSyWCtEtNvrB3wB/69b0bc43f33bfe56cf324a9871b7b35c/image10-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1225\" height=\"408\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>While SYN attacks remain popular, this quarter we’ve seen an enormous uptick of 940% in attacks targeting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)\">Jenkins</a> servers.

A vulnerability in an older version of the server (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2100\">Jenkins 2.218 and earlier</a>) aided the launch of DDoS attacks. This vulnerability was fixed in Jenkins 2.219 by disabling UDP multicast/broadcast messages by default. However, there are still many vulnerable and exposed devices running UDP-based services which are being harnessed to generate volumetric amplification attacks.</p><p>Cloudflare also observed a 433% increase in L3/4 DDoS attacks over the <a href=\"/the-road-to-quic/\">QUIC protocol</a>, a new encrypted-by-default Internet transport protocol that runs over UDP.

Since UDP is stateless, it is easy for attackers to mimic Version Negotiation packets by spoofing the source IP address and overwhelm a client.</p><p>The attacks targeting Cloudflare may have meant to impact Cloudflare’s infrastructure — perhaps by downgrading the versions being used — rather than targeting specific customers.

Unlike application layer DDoS attacks, attackers can (and typically do) spoof the source IP address to obfuscate the source location of the DDoS attack. For this reason, when analyzing L3/4 DDoS attacks, we bucket the traffic by the Cloudflare edge data center locations where the traffic was ingested, and not by the location of the source IP. Cloudflare is able to overcome the challenges of spoofed IPs by displaying the attack data by the location of Cloudflare’s data center in which the attack was observed. We’re able to achieve geographical accuracy in our report because we have <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">data centers in over 200 cities around the world</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4jzyvvFcp0SUb34CmLFP3o/84c17f9049c1f312e7b9db0ca7b60df5/image3-11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1222\" height=\"409\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>To view all regions and countries, check out the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/notebooks/ddos#ddos-activity-by-cloudflare-data-center-country\">Radar DDoS Report dashboard’s interactive map</a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"helping-build-a-better-internet\">Helping build a better Internet</h3>\n            <a href=\"#helping-build-a-better-internet\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Cloudflare was founded with the mission to help build a better Internet — one where the impact of DDoS attacks is a thing of the past. Over the last 10 years, we have been unwavering in our efforts to protect our customers’ Internet properties from DDoS attacks of any size or kind. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/ccp-games/\">CCP Games</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/panasonic/\">Panasonic</a> are two of many customers that benefit from Cloudflare’s DDoS Protection.</p><p>Cloudflare was also recently named a leader in The Forrester WaveTM: DDoS Mitigation Solutions, Q1 2021. You can download a complimentary copy of the report <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/forrester-wave-ddos-mitigation-2021/\">here</a>.</p><p>According to the report, written by Forrester Senior Analyst for Security and Risk, David Holmes, “Cloudflare protects against DDoS from the edge, and fast… customer references view Cloudflare’s edge network as a compelling way to protect and deliver applications.”</p><p>There are three key reasons Cloudflare DDoS Protection is recognized by customer and industry analysts alike:</p><ol><li><p><b>Cloudflare’s network architecture</b>: Cloudflare <a href=\"/no-scrubs-architecture-unmetered-mitigation/\">doesn&#39;t operate scrubbing centers</a>, as we believe that the scrubbing center model is a flawed approach to DDoS protection. Scrubbing centers cause delays and cost too much to build and run. Instead, we run DDoS protection from every server in every data center in our network. Our Anycast-based architecture makes our capacity equivalent to our DDoS scrubbing capacity, the largest in the market at 59 Tbps. This means Cloudflare detects and mitigates DDoS attacks close to the source of attack. Better yet, Cloudflare’s global threat intelligence acts like an immune system for the Internet — employing our machine learning models to learn from and mitigate attacks against any customer to protect them all.</p></li><li><p><b>Fast performance</b>: Our customers constantly tell us that they want robust security but not at the expense of performance. From its inception, Cloudflare was architected so that customers do not incur a latency penalty as a result of attacks. Our Anycast architecture allows us to mitigate attacks closest to the source and analyze traffic out-of-path, ensuring that our DDoS mitigation solution doesn’t add any latency to legitimate traffic. The rule is applied at the most optimal place in the Linux stack for a cost efficient mitigation, ensuring that there&#39;s no performance penalty. <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/slt3lc6tev37/6tiRCy6p07AlHfUIPkYfpI/cad96e1cef8a048fd2a007cffbb2b92e/Magic_Transit_protects_networks_while_also_improving_performance__1_.pdf\">Performance tests</a> over Cloudflare’s network show that the latency decreased by 3 ms and packet loss was nearly zero when traffic was routed over <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/\">Cloudflare Magic Transit</a>.</p></li><li><p><b>Cloudflare’s support</b>: Every Cloudflare enterprise customer account is assigned a team (including an Account Executive, Solution Engineer, and Customer Success Manager) that actively supports customers through onboarding and beyond to help identify areas for optimization in customer configurations.</p></li></ol><p>Cloudflare’s 24x7x365 global “follow the sun” support team is always ready to pick up the phone and provide instant human response when our enterprise customers request urgent support.</p><p>To quote Grant Ingersoll, CTO of the Wikimedia Foundation, “Cloudflare has reliable infrastructure and an extremely competent and responsive team. They are well-positioned to deflect even the largest of attacks.”</p><p>To learn more about Cloudflare’s DDoS solution <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/\">contact us</a> or <a href=\"http://dash.cloudflare.com\">get started</a>.</p>",
