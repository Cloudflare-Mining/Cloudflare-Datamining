	<p>We are thrilled to announce the full support of wildcard and multi-domain application definitions in Cloudflare Access. Until now, Access had limitations that restricted it to a single hostname or a limited set of wildcards. Before diving into these new features letâ€™s review Cloudflare Access and its previous limitations around application definition.</p>

	<p>Cloudflare Access is the gateway to applications, enforcing security policies based on identity, location, network, and device health. Previously, Access applications were defined as a single hostname. A hostname is a unique identifier assigned to a device connected to the internet, commonly used to identify a website, application, or server. For instance, "<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>" is a hostname.</p>
	<p>Upon successful completion of the security checks, a user is granted access to the protected hostname via a cookie in their browser, in the form of a JSON Web Token (JWT). This cookie's session lasts for a specific period of time defined by the administrators and any request made to the hostname must have this cookie present.</p>
	<p>However, a single hostname application definition was not sufficient in certain situations, particularly for organizations with Single Page Applications and/or hundreds of identical hostnames.</p>
	<p>Many Single Page Applications have two separate hostnames - one for the front-end user experience and the other for receiving API requests (e.g., app.example.com and api.example.com). This created a problem for Access customers because the front-end service could no longer communicate with the API as they did not share a session, leading to Access blocking the requests. Developers had to use different custom approaches to issue or share the Access JWT between different hostnames.</p>
	<p>In many instances, organizations also deploy applications using a consistent naming convention, such as example.service123.example.com, especially for automatically provisioned applications. These applications often have the same set of security requirements. Previously, an Access administrator had to create a unique Access application per unique hostname, even if the services were functionally identical. This resulted in hundreds or thousands of Access applications needing to be created.</p>
	<p>We aimed to make things easier for security teams as easier configuration means a more coherent security architecture and ultimately more secure applications.</p>
	<p>We introduced two significant changes to Cloudflare Access: Multi-Domain Applications and Wildcard Support.</p>

	<p>Multi-Domain Applications allow teams to protect multiple subdomains with a single Access app, simplifying the process and reducing the need for multiple apps.</p>

	<p>Access also takes care of JWT cookie issuance across all hostnames associated with a given application. This means that a front-end and API service on two different hostnames can communicate securely without any additional software changes.</p>

	<p>A wildcard is a special character, in this case *, defines a specific application pattern to match instead of explicitly having to define each unique application. Access applications can now be defined using a wildcard anywhere in the subdomain or path of a hostname. This allows an administrator to protect hundreds of applications with a single application policy.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>In a scenario where an application requires additional security controls, Access is configured such that the most specific hostname definition wins (e.g., test.example.com will take precedence over *.example.com).</p>
