We did this to normalize the data, avoid data biases, and be more flexible when it comes to incorporating new mitigation system data into the report.</p><p>In this report, we’ve introduced changes to the methods used to calculate some of those percentages when we bucket attacks by certain <i>dimensions</i> such as <i>target country</i>, <i>source country</i>, or <i>target industry</i>. In the <i>application-layer</i> sections, we previously divided the amount of attack HTTP/S requests to a given dimension by all the HTTP/S requests to all dimensions. In the <i>network-layer</i> section, specifically in <i>Target industries</i> and <i>Target countries,</i> we used to divide the amount of attack IP packets to a given dimension by the total attack packets to all dimensions.</p><p>From this report onwards, we now divide the attack requests (or packets) to a given dimension only by the total requests (or packets) to that given dimension. We made these changes in order to align our calculation methods throughout the report and improve the data accuracy so it better represents the attack landscape.</p><p>For example, the top industry attacked by application-layer DDoS attacks using the previous method was the Gaming and Gambling industry. The attack requests towards that industry accounted for 0.084% of all traffic (attack and non-attack) to all industries. Using that same old method, the Aviation and Aerospace industry came in 12th place. Attack traffic towards the Aviation and Aerospace industry accounted for 0.0065% of all traffic (attack and non-attack) to all industries. However, using the new method, the Aviation and Aerospace industry came in as the number one most attacked industry — attack traffic formed 35% of all traffic (attack and non-attack) towards that industry alone. Again using the new method, the Gaming and Gambling industry came in 14th place — 2.4% of its traffic was attack traffic.</p><p>The old calculation method used in previous reports to calculate the percentage of attack traffic for each dimension was the following:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5KD6tiu5CGosB0PMkCOGC5/69a2bce09409962d82050de996e14447/Screenshot-2023-01-09-at-17.39.06.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1622\" height=\"194\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The new calculation method used from this report onwards is the following:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1lIzK054oLzfg7a3QFKv37/c4f49acb347afb732a11e970aed2109d/Screenshot-2023-01-09-at-17.39.57.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1624\" height=\"196\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The changes apply to the following metrics:</p><ol><li><p>Target industries of application-layer DDoS attacks</p></li><li><p>Target countries of application-layer DDoS attacks</p></li><li><p>Source of application-layer DDoS attacks</p></li><li><p>Target industries of network-layer DDoS attacks</p></li><li><p>Target countries of network-layer DDoS attacks</p></li></ol><p>No other changes were made in the report. The <i>Source of network-layer DDoS attacks</i> metrics already use this method since the first report. Also, no changes were made to the <i>Ransom DDoS attacks</i>, <i>DDoS attack rate</i>, <i>DDoS attack duration, DDoS attack vectors,</i> and <i>Top emerging threats</i> sections.

SYN floods take advantage of the statefulness of the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/\">Three-way TCP handshake</a> — which is the way to establish a connection between a server and a client.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3s4qiqWPfzm7qjCvENsDyj/65b2cc8f635cc0188d53497d1a7b4496/13.png\" alt=\"A graph of the Three-way TCP Handshake\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1296\" height=\"1122\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The Three-way TCP Handshake</p><p>The client starts off by sending a SYN packet, the server responds with a Synchronize-acknowledgement (SYN/ACK) packet and waits for the client’s Acknowledgement (ACK) packet. For every connection, a certain amount of memory is allocated. In the SYN flood, the source IP addresses may be <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing/\">spoofed</a> (altered) by the attacker, causing the server to respond with the SYN/ACK packets to the spoofed IP addresses — which most likely ignore the packet. The server then naively waits for the never arriving ACK packets to complete the handshake. After a while, the server times out and releases those resources. However, given a sufficient amount of SYN packets in a short amount of time, they may be enough to drain the server’s resources and render it unable to handle legitimate user connections or even crash altogether.</p><p>After SYN floods, with a massive drop in share, DNS floods and amplification attacks came in second place, accounting for ~15% of all network-layer DDoS attacks. And in third UDP-based DDoS attacks and floods with a 9% share.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1uXMuSmIxJCkqYlWskjLUH/25c60395b8284d359c7ebb411c62b7c1/14.png\" alt=\"A graph of the top attacks vectors in 2022 Q4\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"987\" height=\"525\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Top attack vectors in 2022 Q4</p><p><b>Emerging DDoS threats</b>In Q4, Memcached-based DDoS attacks saw the highest growth — a 1,338% increase QoQ. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/memcached-ddos-attack/\">Memcached</a> is a database caching system for speeding up websites and networks. Memcached servers that support UDP can be abused to launch amplification/reflection DDoS attacks. In this case, the attacker would request content from the caching system and spoof the victim&#39;s IP address as the source IP in the UDP packets. The victim will be flooded with the Memcache responses which can be amplified by a factor of up to 51,200x.</p><p>In second place, SNMP-based DDoS attacks increased by 709% QoQ. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol\">Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</a> is a UDP-based protocol that is often used to discover and manage network devices such as printers, switches, routers, and firewalls of a home or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/enterprise-networking/\">enterprise network</a> on UDP well-known port 161. In an SNMP reflection attack, the attacker sends out numerous SNMP queries while spoofing the source IP address in the packet as the targets to devices on the network that, in turn, reply to that target’s address. Numerous responses from the devices on the network results in the target network being DDoSed.</p><p>In third place, VxWorks-based DDoS attacks increased by 566% QoQ. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VxWorks\">VxWorks</a> is a real-time operating system (RTOS) often used in embedded systems such as <a href=\"/rethinking-internet-of-things-security/\">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> devices. It also is used in networking and security devices, such as switches, routers, and firewalls. By default, it has a debug service enabled which not only allows anyone to do pretty much anything to those systems, but it can also be used for DDoS amplification attacks.

Attack durations increased across the board, volumetric attacks surged, and Ransom DDoS attacks continued to rise. During the 2022 holiday season, the top targeted industries for DDoS attacks at the application-layer were Aviation/Aerospace and Events Services. Network-layer DDoS attacks targeted Gaming/Gambling, Finance, and Education Management companies. We also saw a shift in the top emerging threats, with Memcached-based DDoS attacks continuing to increase in prevalence.</p><p>Defending against DDoS attacks is critical for organizations of all sizes. While attacks may be initiated by humans, they are executed by bots — and to play to win, you must fight bots with bots. Detection and mitigation must be automated as much as possible, because relying solely on humans puts defenders at a disadvantage. Cloudflare’s automated systems constantly detect and mitigate DDoS attacks for our customers, so they don’t have to.</p><p>Over the years, it has become easier, cheaper, and more accessible for attackers and attackers-for-hire to launch DDoS attacks. But as easy as it has become for the attackers, we want to make sure that it is even easier - and free - for defenders of organizations of all sizes to protect themselves against DDoS attacks of all types. We&#39;ve been providing <a href=\"/unmetered-mitigation/\">unmetered and unlimited DDoS protection</a> for free to all of our customers since 2017 — when we pioneered the concept. Cloudflare&#39;s mission is to help build a better Internet. A better Internet is one that is more secure, faster, and reliable for everyone - even in the face of DDoS attacks.</p><p>Sign up to the <a href=\"https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/eh/2153307/lp/4075983/global-ddos-attack-trends-you-need-to-know\">DDoS Trends Webinar</a> to learn more about the emerging threats and how to defend against them.</p>",
