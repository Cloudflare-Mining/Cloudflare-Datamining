However, the reality is that <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/disruptive-maintenance/\"><u>disruptive maintenance</u></a> requires careful planning, and as Cloudflare grew, managing these complexities through manual coordination between our infrastructure and network operations specialists became nearly impossible.</p><p>It is no longer feasible for a human to track every overlapping maintenance request or account for every customer-specific routing rule in real time. We reached a point where manual oversight alone couldn&#39;t guarantee that a routine hardware update in one part of the world wouldn&#39;t inadvertently conflict with a critical path in another.</p><p>We realized we needed a centralized, automated &quot;brain&quot; to act as a safeguard — a system that could see the entire state of our network at once. By building this scheduler on <a href=\"https://workers.cloudflare.com/\"><u>Cloudflare Workers</u></a>, we created a way to programmatically enforce safety constraints, ensuring that no matter how fast we move, we never sacrifice the reliability of the services on which our customers depend.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll explain how we built it, and share the results we’re seeing now.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"building-a-system-to-de-risk-critical-maintenance-operations\">Building a system to de-risk critical maintenance operations</h2>\n      <a href=\"#building-a-system-to-de-risk-critical-maintenance-operations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Picture an edge router that acts as one of a small, redundant group of gateways that collectively connect the public Internet to the many Cloudflare data centers operating in a metro area. In a populated city, we need to ensure that the multiple data centers sitting behind this small cluster of routers do not get cut off because the routers were all taken offline simultaneously. </p><p>Another maintenance challenge comes from our Zero Trust product, Dedicated CDN Egress IPs, which allows customers to choose specific data centers from which their user traffic will exit Cloudflare and be sent to their geographically close origin servers for low latency. (For the purpose of brevity in this post, we&#39;ll refer to the Dedicated CDN Egress IPs product as &quot;Aegis,&quot; which was its former name.) If all the data centers a customer chose are offline at once, they would see higher latency and possibly 5xx errors, which we must avoid. </p><p>Our maintenance scheduler solves problems like these. We can make sure that we always have at least one edge router active in a certain area. And when scheduling maintenance, we can see if the combination of multiple scheduled events would cause all the data centers for a customer’s Aegis pools to be offline at the same time.</p><p>Before we created the scheduler, these simultaneous disruptive events could cause downtime for customers. Now, our scheduler notifies internal operators of potential conflicts, allowing us to propose a new time to avoid overlapping with other related data center maintenance events.</p><p>We define these operational scenarios, such as edge router availability and customer rules, as maintenance constraints which allow us to plan more predictable and safe maintenance.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"maintenance-constraints\">Maintenance constraints</h2>\n      <a href=\"#maintenance-constraints\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Every constraint starts with a set of proposed maintenance items, such as a network router or list of servers.

This included all server relationships, product configurations, and metrics for product and infrastructure health to compute constraints.

In graph theory, these components are known as vertices and edges, respectively. An object could be a network router and an association could be the list of Aegis pools in the data center that requires the router to be online. We took inspiration from Facebook’s <a href=\"https://research.facebook.com/publications/tao-facebooks-distributed-data-store-for-the-social-graph/\"><u>TAO</u></a> research paper to establish a graph interface on top of our product and infrastructure data. The API looks like the following:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-TypeScript\"><code class=\"language-TypeScript\">type ObjectID = string\n\ninterface MainTAOInterface&lt;TObject, TAssoc, TAssocType&gt; {\n  object_get(id: ObjectID): Promise&lt;TObject | undefined&gt;\n\n  assoc_get(id1: ObjectID, atype: TAssocType): AsyncIterable&lt;TAssoc&gt;\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>The core insight is that associations are typed. For example, a constraint would call the graph interface to retrieve Aegis product data.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-TypeScript\"><code class=\"language-TypeScript\">async function constraint(c: AppContext, aegis: TAOAegisClient, datacenters: string[]): Promise&lt;Record&lt;string, PoolAnalysis&gt;&gt; {\n  const datacenterEntries = await Promise.all(\n    datacenters.map(async (dcID) =&gt; {\n      const iter = aegis.assoc_get(c, dcID, AegisAssocType.DATACENTER_INSIDE_AEGIS_POOL)\n      const pools: string[] = []\n      for await (const assoc of iter) {\n        pools.push(assoc.id2)\n      }\n      return [dcID, pools] as const\n    }),\n  )\n\n  const datacenterToPools = new Map&lt;string, string[]&gt;(datacenterEntries)\n  const uniquePools = new Set&lt;string&gt;()\n  for (const pools of datacenterToPools.values()) {\n    for (const pool of pools) uniquePools.add(pool)\n  }\n\n  const poolTotalsEntries = await Promise.all(\n    [...uniquePools].map(async (pool) =&gt; {\n      const total = aegis.assoc_count(c, pool, AegisAssocType.AEGIS_POOL_CONTAINS_DATACENTER)\n      return [pool, total] as const\n    }),\n  )\n\n  const poolTotals = new Map&lt;string, number&gt;(poolTotalsEntries)\n  const poolAnalysis: Record&lt;string, PoolAnalysis&gt; = {}\n  for (const [dcID, pools] of datacenterToPools.entries()) {\n    for (const pool of pools) {\n      poolAnalysis[pool] = {\n        affectedDatacenters: new Set([dcID]),\n        totalDatacenters: poolTotals.get(pool),\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return poolAnalysis\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>We use two association types in the code above:</p><ol><li><p>DATACENTER_INSIDE_AEGIS_POOL, which retrieves the Aegis customer pools that a data center resides in.</p></li><li><p>AEGIS_POOL_CONTAINS_DATACENTER, which retrieves the data centers an Aegis pool needs to serve traffic.</p></li></ol><p>The associations are inverted indices of one another. The access pattern is exactly the same as before, but now the graph implementation has much more control of how much data it queries. Before, we needed to load all Aegis pools into memory and filter inside constraint business logic. Now, we can directly fetch only the data that matters to the application.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4b68YLIHiOPt5EeyTUTeBt/5f624f0d0912e7dfd0e308a3427d194c/unnamed.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"700\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>The interface is powerful because our graph implementation can improve performance behind the scenes without complicating the business logic.

We took inspiration from this idea and the first middleware component in the fetch pipeline deduplicates inflight HTTP requests, so they all wait on the same Promise for data instead of producing duplicate requests in the same Worker. Next, we use a lightweight Least Recently Used (LRU) cache to internally cache requests that we have already seen before.</p><p>Once both of those are complete, we use Cloudflare’s <code>caches.default.match</code> function to cache all GET requests in the region that the Worker is running. Since we have multiple data sources with different performance characteristics, we choose time to live (TTL) values carefully. For example, real-time data is only cached for 1 minute. Relatively static infrastructure data could be cached for 1–24 hours depending on the type of data. Power management data might be changed manually and infrequently, so we can cache it for longer at the edge.</p><p>In addition to those layers, we have the standard exponential backoff, retries and jitter. This helps reduce wasted <code>fetch</code> calls where a downstream resource might be unavailable temporarily. By backing off slightly, we increase the chance that we fetch the next request successfully. Conversely, if the Worker sends requests constantly without backoff, it will easily breach the subrequest limit when the origin starts returning 5xx errors.</p><p>Putting it all together, we saw ~99% cache hit rate. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cache-hit-ratio/\"><u>Cache hit rate</u></a> is the percentage of HTTP requests served from Cloudflare’s fast cache memory (a &quot;hit&quot;) versus slower requests to data sources running in our control plane (a &quot;miss&quot;), calculated as (hits / (hits + misses)). A high rate means better HTTP request performance and lower costs because querying data from cache in our Worker is an order of magnitude faster than fetching from an origin server in a different region. After tuning settings, for our in memory and CDN caches, hit rates have increased dramatically. Since much of our workload is real-time, we will never have a 100% hit rate as we must request fresh data at least once per minute.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1jifI33QpBkQPd7tE5Tapi/186a74b922faac3abe091b79f03d640b/image1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1120\" height=\"1082\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>We have talked about improving the fetching layer, but not about how we made origin HTTP requests faster.

In order to analyze the health of edge routers, we could send the following query:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">sum by (instance) (network_snmp_interface_admin_status{instance=~&quot;edge.*&quot;})</pre></code>\n            <p>Originally, we asked our Thanos service, which stores Prometheus metrics, for a list of each edge router’s current health status and would manually filter for routers relevant to the maintenance inside the Worker. This is suboptimal for many reasons. For example, Thanos returned multi-MB responses which it needed to decode and encode. The Worker also needed to cache and decode these large HTTP responses only to filter out the majority of the data while processing a specific maintenance request. Since TypeScript is single-threaded and parsing JSON data is CPU-bound, sending two large HTTP requests means that one is blocked waiting for the other to finish parsing.</p><p>Instead, we simply use the graph to find targeted relationships such as the interface links between edge and spine routers, denoted as <code>EDGE_ROUTER_NETWORK_CONNECTS_TO_SPINE</code>.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">sum by (lldp_name) (network_snmp_interface_admin_status{instance=~&quot;edge01.fra03&quot;, lldp_name=~&quot;spine.*&quot;})</pre></code>\n            <p>The result is 1 Kb on average instead of multiple MBs, or approximately 1000x smaller. This also massively reduces the amount of CPU required inside the Worker because we offload most of the deserialization to Thanos. As we explained before, this means we need to make a higher number of these smaller fetch requests, but load balancers in front of Thanos can spread the requests evenly to increase throughput for this use case. </p><p>Our graph implementation and fetch pipeline successfully tamed the &#39;thundering herd&#39; of thousands of tiny real-time requests. However, historical analysis presents a different I/O challenge. Instead of fetching small, specific relationships, we need to scan months of data to find conflicting maintenance windows. In the past, Thanos would issue a massive amount of random reads to our object store, R2. To solve this massive bandwidth penalty without losing performance, we adopted a new approach the Observability team developed internally this year.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"historical-data-analysis\">Historical data analysis</h2>\n      <a href=\"#historical-data-analysis\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>There are enough maintenance use cases that we must rely on historical data to tell us if our solution is accurate and will scale with the growth of Cloudflare’s network. We do not want to cause incidents, and we also want to avoid blocking proposed physical maintenance unnecessarily. In order to balance these two priorities, we can use time series data about maintenance events that happened two months or even a year ago to tell us how often a maintenance event is violating one of our constraints, e.g. edge router availability or Aegis. We blogged earlier this year about using Thanos to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/safe-change-at-any-scale/\"><u>automatically release and revert software</u></a> to the edge.</p><p>Thanos primarily fans out to Prometheus, but when Prometheus&#39; retention is not enough to answer the query it has to download data from object storage — R2 in our case. Prometheus TSDB blocks were originally designed for local SSDs, relying on random access patterns that become a bottleneck when moved to object storage. When our scheduler needs to analyze months of historical maintenance data to identify conflicting constraints, random reads from object storage incur a massive I/O penalty. To solve this, we implemented a conversion layer that transforms these blocks into <a href=\"https://parquet.apache.org/\"><u>Apache Parquet</u></a> files. Parquet is a columnar format native to big data analytics that organizes data by column rather than row, which — together with rich statistics — allows us to only fetch what we need.</p><p>Furthermore, since we are rewriting TSDB blocks into Parquet files, we can also store the data in a way that allows us to read the data in just a few big sequential chunks.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">sum by (instance) (hmd:release_scopes:enabled{dc_id=&quot;45&quot;})</pre></code>\n            <p>In the example above we would choose the tuple “(__name__, dc_id)” as a primary sorting key so that metrics with the name “hmd:release_scopes:enabled” and the same value for “dc_id” get sorted close together.</p><p>Our Parquet gateway now issues precise R2 range requests to fetch only the specific columns relevant to the query. This reduces the payload from megabytes to kilobytes. Furthermore, because these file segments are immutable, we can aggressively cache them on the Cloudflare CDN.</p><p>This turns R2 into a low-latency query engine, allowing us to backtest complex maintenance scenarios against long-term trends instantly, avoiding the timeouts and high tail latency we saw with the original TSDB format. The graph below shows a recent load test, where Parquet reached up to 15x the P90 performance compared to the old system for the same query pattern.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6lVj6W4W4MMUy6cEsDpk5G/21614b7ac003a86cb5162a2ba75f4c42/image8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"622\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>To get a deeper understanding of how the Parquet implementation works, you can watch this talk at PromCon EU 2025, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDN2w2xN6bA&list=PLoz-W_CUquUlHOg314_YttjHL0iGTdE3O&index=16\"><u>Beyond TSDB: Unlocking Prometheus with Parquet for Modern Scale</u></a>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"building-for-scale\">Building for scale</h2>\n      <a href=\"#building-for-scale\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>By leveraging Cloudflare Workers, we moved from a system that ran out of memory to one that intelligently caches data and uses efficient observability tooling to analyze product and infrastructure data in real time.
