In these recent posts, we charted the journey of developing omni-directional communication channels across product, design, and content, and how these relationships directly influence the user experiences we aim to create.</p><p>Today, we’re announcing a new feature within the Teams Dash. We called it “Home”. We created Home with a simple goal in mind: design an adaptive and informative landing page where users can see a round-up of their environment.</p><p>In this last post of our series, we’ll show, rather than tell, how we collaborated as a team that rows in the same direction and towards the same goal — to create a great user experience.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll walk you through your new Teams Home by calling out a few of the guiding principles we had in mind as we designed it.

We wanted to build an experience that allows users to get a comprehensive view of all things protected by Teams — a single pane of glass that’s always available, and that users can quickly pull up to spot any anomalies in their network traffic. Or simply to keep it under control.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/DiFqMLaungkXwQzFY0HXP/dec5f2eda996218dbcb45194243e7d0b/image4-58.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1508\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We’ve also made it simpler for you to keep an eye on user count, and added a direct link to our plans page should you need to make any changes to the subscription you’ve chosen.</p><p>The Teams Home brings all users signals into one view, threading together concepts that were once sparse across the Dash.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"warmth\">Warmth</h3>\n      <a href=\"#warmth\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We called it “Home,” because we wanted it to feel like a space you visit each day that brings you clarity and peace of mind. Too often, security products can feel clinical and stark, and we wanted to avoid that. Through the use of color theory and language analysis, we actively worked to convey a feeling of approachability, while still keeping the Dash functional and straightforward.</p><p>When writing for UX, we need to be considerate of a user’s emotions as they follow a given flow in our product. Some users may appreciate certain elements as they explore the dash on a not-so-busy day; other users may not if their environment is at-risk and they simply need to identify what’s wrong, fast.</p><p>With this in mind, we’ve sprinkled bits of conversational, friendly copy where appropriate. For example, the biggest textual element in the Home page is a greeting — consistent with the header in our Quick Start page (“Welcome aboard!”), the tone is designed to be cheerful and welcoming.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/70yutd8xJBwIiOxuQecLVQ/dadfc5cd75a8e5136ed80613f84febb1/image5-36.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"449\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Another subtle example of this is our loading screen. Nobody likes to wait, so we wanted to build this interaction for our users as well. With an animation that brings in elements representative of Cloudflare’s network, and alternating lines of copy that refer to the semantics of building and cleaning a physical home, we wanted to add a quirky touch where it doesn’t interfere with what really matters.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4o5UdcTtbgYyLuqLtMC5Fw/4663ac7ae75b8c1e91ec0ea6391533fe/image2-56.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1508\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"guidance\">Guidance</h3>\n      <a href=\"#guidance\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Teams family has grown and expanded since its inception, and we wanted to highlight complementary features that are a key part of our user journeys.
