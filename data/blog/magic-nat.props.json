Today, we’re delighted to introduce a new approach to NAT that solves the problems of traditional hardware and virtual solutions. Magic NAT is free from capacity constraints, available everywhere through our global Anycast architecture, and operates across any network (physical or cloud). For Internet connectivity providers, Magic NAT for Carriers operates across high volumes of traffic, removing the complexity and cost associated with NATing thousands or millions of connections.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"what-does-nat-do\">What does NAT do?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#what-does-nat-do\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>The main function of NAT is in its name:  NAT is responsible for <i>translating the network address</i> in the header of an IP packet from one address to another - for example, translating the private IP 192.168.0.1 to the publicly routable IP 192.0.2.1. Organizations use NAT to grant Internet connectivity from private networks, enable routing within private networks with overlapping IP space, and preserve limited IP resources by mapping thousands of connections to a single IP.

The most common example of this is connectivity from your laptop, which might be allocated a private address like 192.168.0.1, reaching out to a public resource like google.com. In order for Google to respond to a request from your laptop, the source IP of your request needs to be publicly routable on the Internet. To accomplish this, your ISP <i>translates</i> the private source IP in your request to a public IP (and reverse-translates for the responses back to you). This use case is often referred to as public NAT, performed by hardware or software acting as a “NAT gateway.”</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2c5BlXgYO4KygMXBbxo7Kw/f00fdf9e80a11c8924d46e5f20e64380/image1-28.png\" alt=\"Public NAT translates private IP addresses to public ones so that traffic from within private networks can access the Internet.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1107\" height=\"494\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Public NAT translates private IP addresses to public ones so that traffic from within private networks can access the Internet.</i></p><p>Users might also have requirements around the specific IP addresses that outgoing packets are NAT’d to. For example, they may need packets to egress from only one or a small subset of IPs so that the services they’re reaching out to can positively identify them - e.g. “only allow traffic from this specific source IP and block everything else.” They might also want traffic to NAT to IPs that accurately reflect the source’s geolocation, in order to pass the “pizza test”: are the results returned for the search term “pizza near me” geographically relevant? These requirements can increase the complexity of a customer’s NAT setup.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"enabling-communication-between-private-subnets-with-overlapping-ip-space\">Enabling communication between private subnets with overlapping IP space</h3>\n            <a href=\"#enabling-communication-between-private-subnets-with-overlapping-ip-space\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>NATs are also used for routing traffic within fully private networks, in order to enable communication between resources with overlapping IP space. One example: imagine that you’re an IT architect at a retail company with a hundred geographically distributed store locations and a central data center. To make your life easier, you want to use the same IP address management scheme for all of your stores - e.g. host all of your printers on 10.0.1.0/24, point of sale devices on 10.0.2.0/24, and security cameras on 10.0.3.0/24. These devices need to reach out to resources hosted in your data center, which is also on your private network. The challenge: if multiple devices across your stores have the same source IP, how do return packets from your data center get back to the right device? This is where private NAT comes in.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7HCPpCpvedR5uQatgJl2YE/16db8f85aac1ea0f3d5b795c37ca3d35/image3-16.png\" alt=\"Private NAT translates IPs into a different private range so that devices with overlapping IP space can communicate with each other.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1163\" height=\"497\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Private NAT translates IPs into a different private range so that devices with overlapping IP space can communicate with each other.</i></p><p>A NAT gateway sitting in a private network can enable connectivity between overlapping subnets by translating the original source IP (the one shared by multiple resources) to an IP in a different range.

A common example is the hub and spoke network architecture, where all Internet-bound traffic is backhauled from geographically distributed locations to be filtered and passed through a NAT gateway to the Internet at a central “hub.” (We’ve written about this challenge previously in the context of <a href=\"/replace-your-hardware-firewalls-with-cloudflare-one/\">hardware firewalls</a>.)</p><p>Managed NAT services offered by cloud providers require customers to deploy NAT gateway instances in specific availability zones. This means that if customers have origin services in multiple availability zones, they either need to backhaul traffic from one zone to another, incurring fees and latency, or deploy instances in multiple zones.
