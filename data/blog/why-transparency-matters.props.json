We are troubled, and I think it is fair to say that the web in general is troubled, at the secrecy surrounding these programs. No sensible person disputes that there is a proper and limited role for law enforcement online. However, the secrecy of this role as it is currently framed, its lack of transparency, strikes against the core of what the web stands for. And it is this secrecy that is fundamentally contrary to CloudFlare&#39;s mission.</p><p>We need to have a public debate about the extent to which governments should or should not surveil the Internet. But, in order to even begin that debate, first we need to properly understand the current state of affairs.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"muzzled\">Muzzled</h3>\n            <a href=\"#muzzled\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>What&#39;s absurd is that, today, the Internet&#39;s largest stakeholders are muzzled from disclosing this topic in any sensible way. If we follow the letter of the law, we cannot disclose even the fact that we&#39;ve received certain kinds of legal orders, let alone their contents or what we&#39;ve done to challenge them. That&#39;s resulted in a sort of Kabuki dance, where Internet giants find themselves forced to parse the meaning of phrases like &quot;direct access,&quot; rather than answering their users&#39; legitimate questions about what&#39;s going on and how this applies to them and their private data.</p><p>Fundamentally, CloudFlare, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and all the Internet giants are in the business of trust. Revealing our customers&#39; private information to governments or anyone else risks that trust and is therefore something we will always fight vigorously against.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"silent-fight\">Silent Fight</h3>\n            <a href=\"#silent-fight\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>At CloudFlare, we hold the data our customers trust with us sacrosanct.

Hopefully someday we will be able to tell them.</p><p>I am encouraged that, from what I&#39;ve seen, by in large just arguments can still carry the day. I recognize it doesn&#39;t always look that way from the outside, and I am troubled that our courts and governments may be headed in the wrong direction. If the goal is justice, then it is in everyone&#39;s best interest that we be as transparent as possible about exactly what is going on.

Technology often serves to undercut law and flow around the restrictions law puts in place. Occasionally, at the opposite extreme, technology serves to amplify law and extend its reach beyond where we, as a society, were ever comfortable.</p><p>When the laws that gave rise to the FISA court and National Security Letters (NSLs) were passed, only just a decade ago, it was hard to imagine you could record and store every telephone conversation. Today that is conceivable. Without a public vote or any conscious decision, technology has amplified the reach of the law to a place where many of us are no longer comfortable.</p><p>It is time for us, as a society, to have a debate about what laws we are comfortable with given today&#39;s technology. In order to do that, we need to have a clear and honest accounting of the current state of affairs. And, in order for that to happen, we need to remove the muzzle and allow companies and governments to talk honestly about what is going on.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"next-steps\">Next Steps</h3>\n            <a href=\"#next-steps\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Today we did a very modest thing: CloudFlare joined with more than 40 other companies and organizations signing a letter calling for greater transparency in law enforcement actions online.

We further urge Congress to pass legislation requiring comprehensive transparency reporting by the federal government and clearly allowing for transparency reporting by companies without requiring companies to first seek permission from the government or the FISA Court.</p><p>Basic information about how the government uses its various law enforcement-related investigative authorities has been published for years without any apparent disruption to criminal investigations. We seek permission for the same information to be made availableregarding the government&#39;s national security-related authorities.</p><p>This information about how and how often the government is using these legal authorities is important to the American people, who areentitled to have an informed public debate about the appropriateness of those authorities and their use, and to international users of US-based service providers who are concerned about the privacy and security of their communications.</p><p>Just as the United States has long been an innovator when it comes to the Internet and products and services that rely upon the Internet, so too should it be an innovator when it comes to creating mechanisms to ensure that government is transparent, accountable, and respectful of civil liberties and human rights. We look forward to working with you to set a standard for transparency reporting that can serve as a positive example for governments across the globe.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Companies</b>AOLApple Inc.CloudFlareCREDO MobileDiggDropboxEvocaFacebookGoogleHeyzapLinkedInMeetupMicrosoftMozillaRedditsalesforce.comSonic.netStripeTumblrTwitterYahoo!YouNow</p><p><b>Investors</b>Boston Common Asset ManagementDomini Social InvestmentsF&amp;C InvestmentsNew Atlantic VenturesUnion Square VenturesY Combinator</p><p><b>Nonprofit Organizations &amp; Trade Associations</b>AccessAmerican Booksellers Foundation for Free ExpressionAmerican Civil Liberties UnionAmerican Library AssociationAmerican Society of News EditorsAmericans for Tax ReformBrennan Center for Justice at NYU Law SchoolCenter for Democracy &amp; TechnologyCenter for Effective GovernmentCommittee to Protect JournalistsCompetitive Enterprise InstituteComputer &amp; Communications Industry AssociationThe Constitution ProjectDemand ProgressElectronic Frontier FoundationFirst Amendment CoalitionFoundation for Innovation and Internet FreedomFreedom to Read FoundationFreedomWorksGlobal Network InitiativeGP-DigitalHuman Rights WatchInternet AssociationNational Association of Criminal Defense LawyersNational Coalition Against CensorshipNew America Foundation&#39;s Open Technology InstituteOpenTheGovernment.orgProject On Government OversightPublic KnowledgeReporters Committee for Freedom of The PressReporters Without BordersTechFreedomWikimedia FoundationWorld Press Freedom Committee</p>",
