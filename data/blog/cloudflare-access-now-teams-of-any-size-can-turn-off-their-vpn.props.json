Logging-in interrupts your workflow. You have to remember a separate set of credentials, which your administrator has to manage. The VPN slows you down when you&#39;re away from the office. Beyond just inconvenience, a VPN can pose a real security risk. A single infected device or malicious user can compromise your network once inside the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-the-network-perimeter/\">perimeter</a>.</p><p>In response, large enterprises have deployed expensive zero trust solutions. The name sounds counterintuitive - don’t we want to add trust to our network security? <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero trust</a> refers to the default state of these tools. They trust no one; each request has to prove that itself. This architecture, most notably demonstrated at Google with Beyondcorp, has allowed teams to start to migrate to a more secure method of access control.</p><p>However, users of zero trust tools still suffer from the same latency problems they endured with old-school VPNs. Even worse, the price tag puts these tools out of reach for most teams.</p><p>Here at Cloudflare, we shared those same frustrations with VPNs. After evaluating our options, we realized we could build <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/\">a better zero trust solution</a> by leveraging some of the unique capabilities we have here at Cloudflare:</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"our\">Our </h3>\n            <a href=\"#our\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Cloudflare’s network spans 150+ data centers around the globe.

However, sometimes you need to open paths for external services or outside groups of users.</p><p>As part of today’s release, you can create policies based on IP addresses. For example, if you have a secure office network, you can allowlist the office’s IP. Users outside of the office will be required to authenticate with their IdP. Or you can require that a user both authenticate against the IdP and be using a specific IP address.</p><p>You can also build a detour to allow traffic to a specified path or subdomain to bypass Access. When enabled, Access will not check requests to that destination for authorization tokens. Traffic will still be protected by your standard Cloudflare features, like DDoS mitigation and SSL encryption.</p><p>This is helpful when third-party services need to reach your site. Say you manage a WordPress site where you want to control who can access protected resources. WordPress can provide additional functionality by creating a connection between the browser and the server using AJAX. To do so, WordPress needs to reach a particular endpoint. With Bypass, you can allow traffic to reach that endpoint while protecting the rest of your site.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"a-quick-demo-of-new-policy-rules\">A Quick Demo of New Policy Rules</h2>\n            <a href=\"#a-quick-demo-of-new-policy-rules\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>When creating an Access policy, you can build with Allow or Deny criteria.
