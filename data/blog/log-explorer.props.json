Security Analytics includes built-in views such as top statistics and in-context quick filters on an intuitive page layout that enables rapid exploration and validation.</p><p>In order to power our rich analytics dashboards with fast query performance, we implemented <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/sampling/\">data sampling</a> using <a href=\"/explaining-cloudflares-abr-analytics\">Adaptive Bit Rate</a> (ABR) analytics. This is a great fit for providing high level aggregate views of the data. However, we received feedback from many Security Analytics power users that sometimes they need access to a more granular view of the data — they need logs.</p><p>Logs provide critical visibility into the operations of today&#39;s computer systems. Engineers and SOC analysts rely on logs every day to troubleshoot issues, identify and investigate security incidents, and tune the performance, reliability, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/\">security</a> of their applications and infrastructure. Traditional metrics or monitoring solutions provide aggregated or statistical data that can be used to identify trends. Metrics are wonderful at identifying THAT an issue happened, but lack the detailed events to help engineers uncover WHY it happened. Engineers and SOC Analysts rely on raw log data to answer questions such as:</p><ul><li><p>What is causing this increase in 403 errors?</p></li><li><p>What data was accessed by this IP address?</p></li><li><p>What was the user experience of this particular user’s session?</p></li></ul><p>Traditionally, these engineers and analysts would stand up a collection of various monitoring tools in order to capture logs and get this visibility. With more organizations using multiple clouds, or a hybrid environment with both cloud and on-premise tools and architecture, it is crucial to have a unified platform to regain visibility into this increasingly complex environment.  As more and more companies are moving towards a cloud native architecture, we see Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cloud/what-is-a-connectivity-cloud/\">connectivity cloud</a> as an integral part of their performance and security strategy.</p><p>Log Explorer provides a lower cost option for storing and exploring log data within Cloudflare. Until today, we have offered the ability to export logs to expensive third party tools, and now with Log Explorer, you can quickly and easily explore your log data without leaving the Cloudflare Dashboard.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"log-explorer-features\">Log Explorer Features</h3>\n            <a href=\"#log-explorer-features\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Whether you&#39;re a SOC Engineer investigating potential incidents, or a Compliance Officer with specific log retention requirements, Log Explorer has you covered.

Log Explorer leverages the <a href=\"https://databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/p975-armbrust.pdf\">Delta Lake</a> protocol, an open-source storage framework for building highly performant, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID\">ACID</a>-compliant databases atop a cloud object store. In other words, Log Explorer combines a large and cost-effective storage system – <a href=\"www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/\">Cloudflare R2</a> – with the benefits of strong consistency and high performance. Additionally, Log Explorer gives you a SQL interface to your Cloudflare logs.</p><p>Each Log Explorer dataset is stored on a per-customer level, just like Cloudflare D1, so that your data isn&#39;t placed with that of other customers. In the future, this single-tenant storage model will give you the flexibility to create your own retention policies and decide in which regions you want to store your data.</p><p>Under the hood, the datasets for each customer are stored as Delta tables in R2 buckets. A <i>Delta table</i> is a storage format that organizes Apache Parquet objects into directories using Hive&#39;s partitioning naming convention. Crucially, Delta tables pair these storage objects with an append-only, checkpointed transaction log. This design allows Log Explorer to support multiple writers with optimistic concurrency.</p><p>Many of the products Cloudflare builds are a direct result of the challenges our own team is looking to address. Log Explorer is a perfect example of this <a href=\"/tag/dogfooding\">culture of dogfooding</a>. Optimistic concurrent writes require atomic updates in the underlying object store, and as a result of our needs, R2 added a PutIfAbsent operation with strong consistency. Thanks, R2! The atomic operation sets Log Explorer apart from Delta Lake solutions based on Amazon Web Services’ S3, which incur the operational burden of using an <a href=\"https://delta.io/blog/2022-05-18-multi-cluster-writes-to-delta-lake-storage-in-s3/\">external store</a> for synchronizing writes.</p><p>Log Explorer is written in the Rust programming language using open-source libraries, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs\">delta-rs</a>, a native Rust implementation of the Delta Lake protocol, and <a href=\"https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/\">Apache Arrow DataFusion</a>, a very fast, extensible query engine. At Cloudflare, Rust has emerged as a popular choice for new product development due to its safety and performance benefits.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next</h3>\n            <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>We know that application security logs are only part of the puzzle in understanding what’s going on in your environment.
