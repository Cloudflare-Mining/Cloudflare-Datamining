The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions.</p><p>While Internet disruptions are never convenient, online interest in the 2022 World Cup in mid-November and the growth in online holiday shopping in many areas during November and December meant that connectivity issues could be particularly disruptive. Having said that, the fourth quarter appeared to be a bit quieter from an Internet disruptions perspective, although Iran and Ukraine continued to be hotspots, as we discuss below.</p><h2>Government directed</h2><p>Multi-hour Internet shutdowns are frequently used by authoritarian governments in response to widespread protests as a means of limiting communications among protestors, as well preventing protestors from sharing information and video with the outside world. During the fourth quarter Cuba and Sudan again implemented such shutdowns, while Iran continued the series of “Internet curfews” across mobile networks it started in mid-September, in addition to implementing several other regional Internet shutdowns.</p><h3>Cuba</h3><p>In late September, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/27/hurricane-ian-cuba-power-florida-00059175\">Hurricane Ian knocked out power across Cuba</a>. While officials worked to restore service as quickly as possible, some citizens responded to perceived delays with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-protests-after-hurricane-ian-fade-anger-over-shortages-simmers-2022-10-03/\">protests</a> that were <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/protests-havana-flare-up-second-night-blackouts-persist-2022-10-01/\">reportedly</a> the largest since anti-government demonstrations over a year earlier. In response to these protests, the Cuban government reportedly cut off Internet access several times. A shutdown on September 29-30 was covered in the <a href=\"/q3-2022-internet-disruption-summary/\">Internet disruptions overview for Q3 2022</a>, and the impact of the shutdown that occurred on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1576029573527080961\">October 1</a> (UTC) is shown in the figure below.

Sudan’s government has a multi-year history of shutting down Internet access during times of civil unrest, and once again implemented an Internet shutdown in response to these protests.

These multi-hour Internet curfew shutdowns continued into early October, with additional similar outages also observed on October 8, 12 and 15 as seen in the figure below. (The graph’s line for AS57218 (Rightel), the smallest of the three mobile providers, suggests that the shutdowns on this network were not implemented after the end of September.)</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2SeeifjMib4L6wCKxmhU7M/26be1277d17cc22eab2511f5375a01a6/Iran---for-Q4-blog-post.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1251\" height=\"397\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In addition to the mobile network shutdowns, several regional Internet disruptions were also observed in Iran during the fourth quarter, two of which we review below.

In countries with more authoritarian governments, the Internet is often weaponized as a means of limiting communication within the country and with the outside world through network-level, regional, or national Internet shutdowns. As noted above, this approach was used aggressively in Iran during the last few months of the year.</p><p>Internet connectivity quickly became a casualty of war in Ukraine. Early in the conflict, network-level outages were common, and some Ukrainian networks ultimately saw traffic re-routed through upstream Russian Internet service providers. Later in the year, as electrical power infrastructure was increasingly targeted by Russian attacks, widespread power outages resulted in multi-hour disruptions of Internet traffic across the country.</p><p>While the volcanic eruption in Tonga took the country offline for over a month due to its reliance on a single submarine cable for Internet connectivity, the damage caused by earthquakes in other countries throughout the year resulted in much shorter and more limited disruptions.</p><p>And while submarine cable issues can impact multiple countries along its route, the advent of services with an increasingly global footprint like SpaceX Starlink mean that service disruptions will ultimately have a much broader impact. (Starlink’s subscriber base is comparatively small at the moment, but it currently has a service footprint in over 30 countries around the world.)</p><p>To follow Internet disruptions as they occur, check the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center\">Cloudflare Radar Outage Center (CROC)</a> and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cloudflareradar\">@CloudflareRadar on Twitter</a>.
