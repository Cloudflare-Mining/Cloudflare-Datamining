The entire team is making sure that things are running smoothly by monitoring dashboards that measure the health of every part of the system.</p><p>It’s every developer’s dream to get the level of visibility that NASA has in their mission control room, but for their own code.

Cloudflare Enterprise customers get access to Logpush for any of our available products, including CDN, WAF, Spectrum and many more. We’re excited to add Workers to this list.</p><p>Logpush for Worker’s Trace Events will include unstructured <code>console.log()</code> messages, exceptions, and metadata about requests/responses. Here is a sample Trace Event for a fetch request:</p><p><code>{&quot;accountID&quot;:123456,&quot;scriptName&quot;:&quot;cloudflare-workers-script&quot;,&quot;outcome&quot;:&quot;ok&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:0.5,&quot;CPUTime&quot;:4,&quot;eventType&quot;:&quot;fetch&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;request&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://workersdevtest.com&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;GET&quot;,&quot;headers&quot;:{&quot;accept&quot;:&quot;*/*&quot;,&quot;accept-encoding&quot;:&quot;gzip&quot;,&quot;connection&quot;:&quot;Keep-Alive&quot;},&quot;cf&quot;:{&quot;clientTcpRtt&quot;:40,&quot;tlsVersion&quot;:&quot;TLSv1.2&quot;,&quot;httpProtocol&quot;:&quot;HTTP/2&quot;,&quot;edgeRequestKeepAliveStatus&quot;:1,&quot;country&quot;:&quot;CA&quot;,&quot;asn&quot;:16591}},&quot;subrequests&quot;:{&quot;request&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://example.com&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;GET&quot;,&quot;headers&quot;:{&quot;x-custom-header&quot;:&quot;my-header-value&quot;}},&quot;logs&quot;:[{&quot;message&quot;:[&quot;foo&quot;],&quot;level&quot;:&quot;log&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;:1587491479166}],&quot;exceptions&quot;:[]}}}</code></p><p>With this new dataset, our Enterprise customers will be able to send Workers logs to their preferred cloud storage destination such as GCS or R2 or to analysis platforms like Splunk or New Relic. Logpush handles batching and can scale no matter how much traffic your Worker gets.</p><p>This brings new ways to get transparency into Workers! You can pinpoint when a fetch request fails, find out which call is adding the most lag in your application, and track down specific log lines to debug the end user experience. Also, combine Workers logs with HTTP request logs to get a better picture of the full request lifecycle.</p><p>It also opens up doors for SaaS companies building on Workers. SaaS companies can <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/app-performance-monitoring/\">get visibility into how their customer’s applications are performing</a> and expose logs to their customer’s developers to make debugging and troubleshooting much easier.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"mission-control-in-the-making\">Mission Control in the making</h3>\n            <a href=\"#mission-control-in-the-making\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>wrangler tail, Workers Analytics Engine (coming later this week!) and Logpush for Worker’s Trace Events are an elite trio to give visibility into every aspect of a Worker.</p><p>When you’re deep in the mix of development, wrangler tail is by your side to help you crush bugs and eliminate errors.  With Workers Analytics Engine, you can instrument business logic and query aggregates within seconds to populate dashboards for monitoring.
