It’s because of <b>quantum computers</b>. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/quantum/what-is-quantum-computing/\"><u>These marvelous devices</u></a>, instead of restricting themselves to zeroes and ones, compute using more of what nature actually affords us: quantum superposition, interference, and entanglement. This allows quantum computers to excel at certain very specific computations, notably simulating nature itself, which will be very helpful in developing new materials.</p><p>Quantum computers are not going to replace regular computers, though: they’re actually much worse than regular computers at most tasks that matter for our daily lives. Think of them as graphic cards or neural engines — specialized devices for specific computations, not general-purpose ones.</p><p>Unfortunately, quantum computers also <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-quantum-menace\"><u>excel</u></a> at breaking key cryptography that still is in common use today, such as RSA and elliptic curves (ECC). Thus, we are moving to <b>post-quantum cryptography</b>: cryptography designed to be resistant against quantum attack. We’ll discuss the exact impact on the different types of cryptography later on.</p><p>For now, quantum computers are rather anemic: they’re simply not good enough today to crack any real-world cryptographic keys. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t worry yet: encrypted traffic can be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later\"><u>harvested today</u></a>, and decrypted after <b>Q-day</b>: the day that quantum computers are capable of breaking today’s still widely used cryptography such as RSA-2048. We call that a “harvest-now-decrypt-later” attack.</p><p>Using factoring as a benchmark, quantum computers don’t impress at all: the largest number factored by a quantum computer without cheating is 15, a record that’s easily beaten in a <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1237.pdf\"><u>variety of funny ways</u></a>. It’s tempting to disregard quantum computers until they start beating classical computers on factoring, but that would be a big mistake. Even conservative estimates place Q-day <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nJxENYdsB6c?si=doosb_aZRpQgo6X8&t=1302\"><u>less than three years</u></a> after the day that quantum computers beat classical computers on factoring.

There are low-level details that can make a big difference, such as the interconnectedness of qubits. More importantly, the graph doesn’t capture how scalable the engineering behind the records is.</p><p>To wit, on these graphs the progress on quantum computers seems to have stalled the last two years, whereas for experts, Google’s <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/\"><u>December 2024 Willow announcement</u></a> that is unremarkable on the graph, is in reality a <a href=\"https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=8525\"><u>real milestone</u></a> achieving the first logical qubit in the surface code in a scalable manner. <a href=\"https://sam-jaques.appspot.com/quantum_landscape_2024\"><u>Quoting</u></a> Sam Jaques:</p><blockquote><p>When I first read these results [Willow’s achievements], I felt chills of “Oh wow, quantum computing is actually real”.</p></blockquote><p>It’s a real milestone, but not an unexpected leap. Quoting Sam again:</p><blockquote><p>Despite my enthusiasm, this is more or less where we should expect to be, and maybe a bit late. All of the big breakthroughs they demonstrated are steps we needed to take to even hope to reach the 20 million qubit machine that could break RSA. There are no unexpected breakthroughs. Think of it like the increases in transistor density of classical chips each year: an impressive feat, but ultimately business-as-usual.</p></blockquote><p>Business-as-usual is also the strategy: the superconducting qubit approach pursued by Google for Willow has always had the clearest path forward attacking the difficulties head-on requiring fewest leaps in engineering.</p><p>Microsoft pursues the opposite strategy with their bet on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer\"><u>topological qubits</u></a>. These are qubits that in theory would mostly not be unaffected by noise. However, they have not been fully realized in hardware. If these can be built in a scalable way, they’d be far superior to superconducting qubits. But we don’t even know if these can be built to begin with. Early 2025 Microsoft announced the <a href=\"https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=8669\"><u>Majorana 1</u></a> chip, which demonstrates how these could be built. The chip is far from a full demonstrator though: it doesn’t support any computation and hence doesn’t even show up in Sam’s comparison graph earlier.</p><p>In between topological and superconducting qubits, there are many other approaches that labs across the world pursue that do show up in the graph, such as QuEra with <a href=\"https://www.quera.com/neutral-atom-platform\"><u>neutral atoms</u></a> and Quantinuum with <a href=\"https://www.quantinuum.com/products-solutions/quantinuum-systems/system-model-h2\"><u>trapped ions</u></a>.</p><p>Progress on the hardware side of getting to Q-day has received by far the most amount of press interest.

It turns out we can do it with much less. In a stunningly comprehensive June 2025 paper, <a href=\"https://algassert.com/about.html\"><u>Craig Gidney</u></a> shows that with clever quantum software optimisations we need fewer than <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15917\"><u>one million qubits</u></a>. This is the reason the red lines in Sam’s graph above, marking the size of a quantum computer to break RSA, dramatically shift to the left in 2025.</p><p>To put this achievement into perspective, let’s just make a wild guess and say Google can maintain a sort of Moore’s law and doubles the number of physical qubits every one-and-a-half years. That’s a much faster pace than Google demonstrated so far, but it’s also not unthinkable they could achieve this once the groundwork has been laid. Then it’d take until 2052 to reach 20 million qubits, but only until 2045 to reach one million: Craig single-handedly brought Q-day <b>seven years</b> closer!</p><p>How much further can software optimisations go?

With the wild guess on quantum computer progress before, that’d correspond to a Q-day of 2039 and 2041+ respectively.</p><p>Although Craig’s estimate makes detailed and reasonable assumptions on the architecture of a large-scale superconducting qubits quantum computer, it’s still a guess, and these estimates could be off quite a bit.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"a-proper-scare-chens-algorithm\">A proper scare: Chen’s algorithm</h4>\n      <a href=\"#a-proper-scare-chens-algorithm\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>On the algorithmic side, we might not only see improvements to existing quantum algorithms, but also the discovery of completely new quantum algorithms. April 2024, Yilei Chen published <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555\"><u>a preprint</u></a> claiming to have found such a new quantum algorithm to solve certain lattice problems, which are close, but not the same as those we rely on for the post-quantum cryptography we deploy. This caused a proper stir: even if it couldn’t attack our post-quantum algorithms today, could Chen’s algorithm be improved? To get a sense for potential improvements, you need to understand what the algorithm is really doing on a higher level. With Chen’s algorithm that’s hard, as it’s very complex, much more so than Shor’s quantum algorithm that breaks RSA. So it took some time for experts to <a href=\"https://nigelsmart.github.io/LWE.html\"><u>start</u></a> <a href=\"https://sam-jaques.appspot.com/static/files/555-notes.pdf\"><u>seeing</u></a> limitations to Chen’s approach, and in fact, after ten days they discovered a fundamental bug in the algorithm: the approach doesn’t work. Crisis averted.</p><p>What to take from this? Optimistically, this is business as usual for cryptography, and lattices are in a better shape now as one avenue of attack turned out to be a dead end. Realistically, it <i>is</i> a reminder that we have a lot of eggs in the lattices basket.

The way <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/\"><u>NIST</u></a>, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (who have been spearheading the standardization of post-quantum cryptography) defines their post-quantum security levels is very telling. They define a specific security level by saying the scheme should be as hard to crack using either a classical or quantum computer as an existing symmetric cipher as follows:</p><table><tr><td><p><b>Level</b></p></td><td><p><b>Definition,</b> as least as hard to break as … </p></td><td><p><b>Example</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>To recover the key of <b>AES-128</b> by exhaustive search</p></td><td><p>ML-KEM-512, SLH-DSA-128s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>To find a collision in <b>SHA256</b> by exhaustive search</p></td><td><p>ML-DSA-44</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>To recover the key of <b>AES-192</b> by exhaustive search</p></td><td><p>ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA-65</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>To find a collision in <b>SHA384</b> by exhaustive search</p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>To recover the key of <b>AES-256</b> by exhaustive search</p></td><td><p>ML-KEM-1024, SLH-DSA-256s, ML-DSA-87</p></td></tr></table><p><sup>NIST PQC security levels, higher is harder to break (“more secure”). The examples ML-DSA, SLH-DSA and ML-KEM are covered below.</sup></p><p>There are good intentions behind suggesting doubling the key lengths of symmetric cryptography. In many use cases, the extra cost is not that high, and it mitigates any theoretical risk completely. Scaling symmetric cryptography is cheap: double the bits is typically far less than half the cost. So on the surface, it is simple advice.</p><p>But if we insist on AES-256, it seems only logical to insist on NIST PQC level 5 for the public key cryptography as well. The problem is that public key cryptography does not scale very well. Depending on the scheme, going from level 1 to level 5 typically more than doubles data usage and CPU cost. As we’ll see, deploying post-quantum signatures at level 1 is already painful, and deploying them at level 5 is debilitating.</p><p>But more importantly, organizations only have limited resources. We wouldn’t want an organization to prioritize upgrading AES-128 at the cost of leaving the definitely quantum-vulnerable RSA around.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"first-migration-key-agreement\">First migration: key agreement</h3>\n      <a href=\"#first-migration-key-agreement\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Symmetric ciphers are not enough on their own: how do I know which key to use when visiting a website for the first time?

If we only do key agreement, an attacker in the middle can do separate key agreements with the browser and server, and re-encrypt any exchanged messages. To prevent this we need one final ingredient: authentication.</p><p>This is achieved using <b>signatures</b>. When visiting a website, say <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com\"><u>cloudflare.com</u></a>, the web server presents a <b>certificate</b> signed by a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority\"><u>certification authority</u></a> (CA) that vouches that the public key in that certificate is controlled by <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com\"><u>cloudflare.com</u></a>. In turn, the web server signs the handshake and shared key using the private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate. This allows the client to be sure that they’ve done a key agreement with <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com\"><u>cloudflare.com</u></a>.</p><p>RSA and ECDSA are commonly used traditional signature schemes today. Again, Shor’s algorithm makes short work of them, allowing a quantum attacker to forge any signature. That means that an attacker with a quantum computer can impersonate (and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\"><u>MitM</u></a>) any website for which we accept non post-quantum certificates.</p><p>This attack can only be performed after quantum computers are able to crack RSA / ECDSA. This makes upgrading signature schemes for TLS on the face of it less urgent, as we only need to have everyone migrated before Q-day rolls around. Unfortunately, we will see that migration to post-quantum signatures is much <b>more difficult</b>, and will require more time.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"progress-timeline\">Progress timeline</h2>\n      <a href=\"#progress-timeline\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Before we dive into the technical challenges of migrating the Internet to post-quantum cryptography, let’s have a look at how we got here, and what to expect in the coming years.

It took another 14 years before Shor published <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/365700\"><u>his algorithm</u></a> attacking RSA / ECC. Most post-quantum cryptography predates Shor’s famous algorithm.</p><p>There are various branches of post-quantum cryptography, of which the most prominent are lattice-based, hash-based, multivariate, code-based, and isogeny-based. Except for isogeny-based cryptography, none of these were initially conceived as post-quantum cryptography. In fact, early code-based and hash-based schemes are contemporaries of RSA, being proposed in the 1970s, and comfortably predate the publication of Shor’s algorithm in 1994. Also, the first multivariate scheme from 1988 is comfortably older than Shor’s algorithm. It is a nice coincidence that the most successful branch, lattice-based cryptography, is Shor’s closest contemporary, being proposed <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/237814.237838\"><u>in 1996</u></a>. For comparison, elliptic curve cryptography, which is widely used today, was first proposed in 1985.</p><p>In the years after the publication of Shor’s algorithm, cryptographers took measure of the existing cryptography: what’s clearly broken, and what could be post-quantum secure?

Anyone can participate by submitting schemes and evaluating the proposals. Cryptographers from all over the world submitted algorithms. To focus attention, the list of submissions were whittled down over three rounds. From the original 82, based on public feedback, eight made it into the final round. From those eight, in 2022, NIST chose to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise\"><u>pick four to standardize first</u></a>: one <b>KEM </b>(for key agreement) and three signature schemes.</p><table><tr><td><p><b>Old name</b></p></td><td><p><b>New name</b></p></td><td><p><b>Branch</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kyber</p></td><td><p><b>ML-KEM</b> (<a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final\"><u>FIPS 203</u></a>)\nModule-lattice based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard</p></td><td><p>Lattice-based</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dilithium</p></td><td><p><b>ML-DSA </b>(<a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final\"><u>FIPS 204</u></a>)</p><p>Module-lattice based Digital Signature Standard</p></td><td><p>Lattice-based</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>SPHINCS<sup>+</sup></p></td><td><p><b>SLH-DSA</b> (<a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final\"><u>FIPS 205</u></a>)</p><p>Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard</p></td><td><p>Hash-based</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Falcon</p></td><td><p><b>FN-DSA </b>(not standardised yet)<b>\n</b>FFT over NTRU lattices Digital Signature Standard</p></td><td><p>Lattice-based</p></td></tr></table><p>The final standards for the first three have been published August 2024.

And there are even more signatures set to be <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/\"><u>standardized in the future</u></a>. The reason is that none of the proposed signatures are close to ideal. In short, they all have much larger keys and signatures than we’re used to.</p><p>From a security standpoint SLH-DSA is the most conservative choice, but also the worst performer. For public key and signature sizes, FN-DSA is as good as it gets for these three, but it is difficult to implement signing safely because of floating-point arithmetic. Due to FN-DSA’s limited applicability and design complexity, NIST chose to focus on the other three schemes first.</p><p>This leaves ML-DSA as the default pick.

It’s also required to standardize the way the new algorithms are used in higher level protocols. In many cases, such as key agreement in TLS, this can be as simple as assigning an identifier to the new algorithms. In other cases, such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/\"><u>DNSSEC</u></a>, it requires a bit more thought. Many working groups at the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/\"><u>IETF</u></a> have been preparing for years for the arrival of NIST’s final standards, and we expected many protocol integrations to be finalized soon after, before the end of 2024. That was too optimistic: some are done, but many are not finished yet.</p><p>Let’s start with the good news and look at what is done.</p><ul><li><p>The hybrid TLS key agreement <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-ecdhe-mlkem/\"><u>X25519MLKEM768</u></a> that combines X25519 and ML-KEM-768 (more about it later) is ready to use and is indeed quite widely deployed. Other protocols are likewise adopting ML-KEM in a hybrid mode of operation, such as <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-mlkem/\"><u>IPsec</u></a>, which is ready to go for simple setups. (For certain setups, there is a <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-downgrade-prevention/\"><u>little wrinkle</u></a> that still needs to be figured out. We’ll cover that in a future blog post.)\n\nIt might be surprising that the corresponding RFCs have not been published yet. Registering a key agreement to TLS or IPsec does not require an RFC though. In both cases, the RFC is still being pursued to avoid confusion for those that would expect an RFC, and for TLS it’s required to mark the key agreement as recommended.</p></li><li><p>For signatures, ML-DSA’s integration <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates/\"><u>in X.509</u></a> certificates and <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-mldsa/\"><u>TLS</u></a> are good to go. The former is a freshly minted RFC, and the latter doesn’t require one.</p></li></ul><p>Now, for the bad news. At the time of writing, October 2025, the IETF hasn’t <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs/\"><u>locked down</u></a> how to do hybrid certificates: certificates where both a post-quantum and a traditional signature scheme are combined. But it’s close. We hope this’ll be figured out early 2026.</p><p>But if it’s just assigning some identifiers, what’s the cause of the delay? Mostly it’s about choice.

This is useful, if you don’t want to send a big file to an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module\"><u>HSM</u></a> to sign. Early drafts of ML-DSA  support prehashing with SHAKE256, but that <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/documents/faq/fips204-sec6-03192025.pdf\"><u>was</u></a> not obvious. In the final version of ML-DSA, NIST included two variants: regular ML-DSA, and an explicitly prehashed version, where you are allowed to choose any hash. Having different variants is not ideal, as users will have to choose which one to pick; not all software might support all variants; and testing/validation has to be done for all. It’s not controversial to want to pick just one variant, but the issue <a href=\"https://globalplatform.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/4_ML-DSA-and-ML-KEM-Landmines-1.pdf\"><u>is</u></a> <a href=\"https://keymaterial.net/2024/11/05/hashml-dsa-considered-harmful/\"><u>which</u></a>. After plenty of debate, regular ML-DSA was chosen.</p><p>The second matter is <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/122/materials/slides-122-pquip-the-great-private-key-war-of-25-02.pdf\"><u>private key forma</u></a>t. Because of the way that candidates are compared on performance benchmarks, it looks good for the original ML-DSA submission to cache some computation in the private key. This means that the private key is larger (several kilobytes) than it needs to be and requires more validation steps. It was suggested to cut the private key down to its bare essentials: just a 32-byte <i>seed</i>. For the final standard, NIST decided to allow both the seed and the original larger private key. This is not <a href=\"https://keymaterial.net/2025/02/19/how-not-to-format-a-private-key/\"><u>ideal</u></a>: better stick to one of the two. In this case, the IETF wasn’t able to make a choice, and even added a third option: a pair of both the seed and expanded private key. Technically almost everyone agreed that <i>seed</i> is the superior choice, but the reason it wasn’t palatable is that some vendors already created keys for which they didn’t keep the <i>seed</i> around. Yes, we already have post-quantum legacy. It took almost a year to make these two choices.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"hybrids-require-many-choices\">Hybrids require many choices</h4>\n      <a href=\"#hybrids-require-many-choices\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>To define an ML-DSA hybrid signature scheme, there are many more choices to make.

Also, the question of prehashing returns with a third option: prehash on the hybrid level.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs/12/\"><u>October 2025 draft</u></a> for ML-DSA hybrid signatures contains 18 variants, down from <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs/03/\"><u>26</u></a> a year earlier. Again, everyone agrees that that is too much, but it’s been hard to whittle it down further. To help end-users choose, a short list was added, which started with three options, and of course grew itself to <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs-12.html#section-11.3\"><u>six</u></a>. Of those, we think MLDSA44-ECDSA-P256-SHA256 will see wide support and use on the Internet.</p><p>Now, let’s return to key agreement for which the standards have been set.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"tls-stacks-get-support-for-ml-kem\">TLS stacks get support for ML-KEM</h2>\n      <a href=\"#tls-stacks-get-support-for-ml-kem\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The next step is software support. Not all ecosystems can move at the same speed, but we’ve seen major adoption of post-quantum key agreement to counter store-now/decrypt-later already. Recent versions of all major browsers, and many TLS libraries and platforms, notably OpenSSL, Go, and recent Apple OSes have enabled X25519MLKEM768 by default. We keep an overview <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/post-quantum-cryptography/pqc-support/\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>Again, for TLS there is a big difference again between key agreement and signatures. For key agreement, the server and client can add and enable support for post-quantum key agreement independently. Once enabled on both sides, TLS negotiation will use post-quantum key agreement. We go into detail on TLS negotiation in <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all#tls-anchor\"><u>this blog post</u></a>. If your product just uses TLS, your store-now/decrypt-now problem could be solved by a simple software update of the TLS library.</p><p>Post-quantum TLS certificates are more of a hassle. Unless you control both ends, you’ll need to install two certificates: one post-quantum certificate for the new clients, and a traditional one for the old clients. If you aren’t using automated issuance of certificates yet, this might be a good reason to <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/\"><u>check that out</u></a>. TLS allows the client to signal which signature schemes it supports so that the server can choose to serve a post-quantum certificate only to those clients that support it. Unfortunately, although almost all TLS libraries support setting up multiple certificates, not all servers expose that configuration. If they do, it will still require a configuration change in most cases. (Although undoubtedly <a href=\"https://caddyserver.com/\"><u>caddy</u></a> will do it for you.)</p><p>Talking about post-quantum certificates: it will take some time before Certification Authorities (CAs) can issue them. Their <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/hardware_security_module_hsm\"><u>HSMs</u></a> will first need (hardware) support, which then will need to be audited. Also, the <a href=\"https://cabforum.org/\"><u>CA/Browser forum</u></a> needs to approve the use of the new algorithms. Root programs have different opinions about timelines. From the grapevine, we hear one of the root programs is preparing a pilot to accept one-year ML-DSA-87 certificates, perhaps even before the end of 2025. A CA/Browser forum ballot is <a href=\"https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/pull/624\"><u>being drafted</u></a> to support this. Chrome on the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/O_BXzJv16zQ?t=19274s\"><u>prefers</u></a> to solve the large certificate issue first. For the early movers, the audits are likely to be the bottleneck, as there will be a lot of submissions after the publication of the NIST standards. Although we’ll see the first post-quantum certificates in 2026, it’s unlikely they will be broadly available or trusted by all browsers before 2027.</p><p>We are in an interesting in-between time, where a lot of Internet traffic is protected by post-quantum key agreement, but not a single public post-quantum certificate is used.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"the-search-continues-for-more-schemes\">The search continues for more schemes</h2>\n      <a href=\"#the-search-continues-for-more-schemes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>NIST is not quite done standardizing post-quantum cryptography.

They’d like to have a second one, a <b>backup KEM</b>, not based on lattices in case those turn out to be weaker than expected. To find it,  they extended the original competition with a fourth round to pick a backup KEM among the finalists. In March 2025, <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/03/nist-selects-hqc-fifth-algorithm-post-quantum-encryption#:~:text=NIST%20has%20chosen%20a%20new,were%20discovered%20in%20ML%2DKEM.\"><u>HQC</u></a> was <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/03/nist-selects-hqc-fifth-algorithm-post-quantum-encryption#:~:text=NIST%20has%20chosen%20a%20new,were%20discovered%20in%20ML%2DKEM.\"><u>selected</u></a> to be standardized.</p><p>HQC performs much worse than ML-KEM on every single metric. HQC-1, the lowest security level variant, requires 7kB of data on the wire. This is almost double the 3kB required for ML-KEM-1024, the highest security level variant. There is a similar gap in CPU performance. Also HQC scales worse with security level: where ML-KEM-1024 is about double the cost of ML-KEM-512, the highest security level of HQC requires three times the data (21kB!) and more than four times the compute.</p><p>What about the security? To hedge against gradually improved attacks, ML-KEM-768 has a clear edge over HQC-1, it performs much better, and it has a huge security margin at level 3 compared to level 1. What about leaps? Both ML-KEM and HQC use a similar algebraic structure on top of plain lattices and codes respectively: it is not inconceivable that a breakthrough there could apply to both. Now, also without the algebraic structure, codes and lattices feel related. We’re well into speculation: a catastrophic attack on lattices might not affect codes, but it wouldn’t be surprising too if it did. After all, RSA and ECC that are more dissimilar are both broken by quantum computers.</p><p>There might still be peace of mind to keep HQC around just in case. Here, we’d like to share an anecdote from the chaotic week when it was not clear yet that Chen’s quantum algorithm against lattices was flawed. What to replace ML-KEM with if it would be affected? HQC was briefly considered, but it was clear that an adjusted variant of ML-KEM would still be much more performant.</p><p>Stepping back: that we’re looking for a <i>second</i> efficient KEM is a luxury position. If I were granted a wish for a new post-quantum scheme, I wouldn’t ask for a better KEM, but for a better signature scheme. Let’s see if I get lucky.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"signatures-onramp\">Signatures onramp</h3>\n      <a href=\"#signatures-onramp\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In late 2022, after announcing the first four picks, NIST also called a new competition, dubbed the <i>signatures onramp</i>, to find <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig\"><u>additional signature schemes</u></a>. The competition has two goals. The first is hedging against cryptanalytic breakthroughs against lattice-based cryptography. NIST would like to standardize a signature that performs better than SLH-DSA (both in size and compute), but is not based on lattices. Secondly, they’re looking for a signature scheme that might do well in use cases where the current roster doesn’t do well: we will discuss those at length later on in this post.</p><p>In July 2023, NIST posted the <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2023/additional-pqc-digital-signature-candidates\"><u>40 submissions</u></a> they received for a first round of public review. The cryptographic community got to work, and as is quite normal for a first round, many of the schemes were broken within a week. By February 2024, ten submissions were broken completely, and several others were weakened drastically. Out of the standing candidates, in October 2024, NIST selected 14 submissions for the second round.</p><p>A year ago, we wrote <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/\"><u>a blog post</u></a> covering these 14 submissions in great detail. The short of it: there has been amazing progress on post-quantum signature schemes. We will touch briefly upon them later on, and give some updates on the advances since last year. It is worth mentioning that just like the main post-quantum competition, the selection process will take many years. It is unlikely that any of these onramp signature schemes will be standardized before 2028 — if they’re not broken in the first place. That means that although they’re very welcome in the future, we can’t trust that better signature schemes will solve our problems today.

In that case, X25519 still provides non-post-quantum security, and our post-quantum migration didn’t make things worse.</p><p>More important is that we do not only worry about attacks on the algorithm, but also on the implementation. A noteworthy example where we dodged a bullet is that of <a href=\"https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/\"><u>KyberSlash</u></a>, a timing attack that affected many implementations of Kyber (an earlier version of ML-KEM), including <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/security/advisories/GHSA-9763-4f94-gfch\"><u>our own</u></a>. Luckily KyberSlash does not affect Kyber as it is used in TLS. A similar implementation mistake that would actually affect TLS, is likely to require an active attacker. In that case, the likely aim of the attacker wouldn’t be to decrypt data decades down the line, but steal a cookie or other token, or inject a payload. Including X25519 prevents such an attack.</p><p>So how well do ML-KEM-768 and X25519 together perform in practice?</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"performance-and-protocol-ossification\">Performance and protocol ossification</h2>\n      <a href=\"#performance-and-protocol-ossification\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"browser-experiments\">Browser experiments</h3>\n      <a href=\"#browser-experiments\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Being well aware of potential compatibility and performance issues, Google started <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html\"><u>a first experiment</u></a> with post-quantum cryptography back in 2016, the same year NIST started their competition. This was followed up by a second larger joint experiment by <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/towards-post-quantum-cryptography-in-tls/\"><u>Cloudflare</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.imperialviolet.org/2018/12/12/cecpq2.html\"><u>Google</u></a> in 2018. We tested two different hybrid post-quantum key agreements: CECPQ2, which is a combination of the lattice-based NTRU-HRSS and X25519, and CECPQ2b, a combination of the isogeny-based SIKE and again X25519. NTRU-HRSS is very similar to ML-KEM in size, but is computationally somewhat more taxing on the client-side. SIKE on the other hand, has very small keys, is computationally very expensive, and was <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975.pdf\"><u>completely broken</u></a> in 2022. With respect to TLS handshake times, X25519+NTRU-HRSS performed very well.</p><p>Unfortunately, a small but significant fraction of clients experienced broken connections with NTRU-HRSS. The reason: the size of the NTRU-HRSS keyshares. In the past, when creating a TLS connection, the first message sent by the client, the so-called <i>ClientHello</i>, almost always fit within a single network packet. The TLS specification allows for a larger <i>ClientHello</i>, however no one really made use of that. Thus, protocol ossification strikes again as there are some middleboxes, load-balancers, and other software that tacitly assume the <i>ClientHello</i> always fits in a single packet.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"long-road-to-50\">Long road to 50%</h2>\n      <a href=\"#long-road-to-50\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Over the subsequent years, we kept experimenting with PQ, switching to Kyber in 2022, and ML-KEM in 2024.

What does it look like with origins? Well, it depends.</p><p>There are two ways to enable post-quantum key agreement: the fast way, and the slow but safer way. In both cases, if the origin doesn’t support post-quantum, they’ll fall back safely to traditional key agreement. We explain the details in this <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-to-origins\"><u>blog post</u></a>, but in short, in the fast way we send the post-quantum keys immediately, and in the safer way we postpone it by one roundtrip using <i>HelloRetryRequest</i>. All major browsers use the fast way.</p><p>We have been regularly scanning all origins to see what they support. The good news is that all origins supported the safe but slow method. The fast method didn’t fare as well, as we found that 0.05% of connections would break. That’s too high to enable the fast method by default. We did enable PQ to origins using the safer method by default for all non-enterprise customers and enterprise customers can opt in.</p><p>We are not satisfied though until it’s fast and enabled for everyone.

Most of that is still up-to-date, but there have been some exciting developments. Here we’ll just go over some highlights and some exciting updates of last year.</p><p>Let’s start by sizing up the post-quantum signatures we have available today at the AES-128 security level: ML-DSA-44 and the two variants of SLH-DSA. We use ML-DSA-44 as the baseline, as that’s the scheme that’s going to see the most widespread use initially. As a comparison, we also include the venerable Ed25519 and RSA-2048 in wide use today, as well as FN-DSA-512 which will be standardised soon and a sample of nine for TLS promising signature schemes from the signatures onramp.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4NC2lO6hXKEFOgaVgQ7ExO/a0a65ddbb24d11ad96405f19aa344f4b/Screenshot_2025-10-28_at_13.18.54.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1594\" height=\"1138\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup>Comparison of various signature schemes at the security level of AES-128.

The exceptions are SQISign, MAYO, SNOVA, and UOV from the onramp, but they’re far from ideal.

FN-DSA-512’s signatures and public key together are <i>only</i> 1,563 bytes, with somewhat reasonable signing time. FN-DSA has an <b>achilles heel</b> though — for acceptable signing performance, it requires fast floating-point arithmetic. Without it, signing is about 20 times slower. But speed is not enough, as the floating-point arithmetic has to run in constant time — without it, the FN-DSA private key can be recovered by timing signature creation. Writing safe FN-DSA implementations has turned out to be quite challenging, which makes FN-DSA dangerous when signatures are generated on the fly, such as in a TLS handshake. It is good to stress that this only affects signing. FN-DSA verification does not require floating-point arithmetic (and during verification there wouldn’t be a private key to leak anyway.)</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"there-are-many-signatures-on-the-web\">There are many signatures on the web</h2>\n      <a href=\"#there-are-many-signatures-on-the-web\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The biggest pain-point of migrating the Internet to post-quantum signatures, is that there are a lot of signatures even in a single connection.

Thus, for those, a signature scheme with smaller signatures but larger public keys, such as MAYO, SNOVA, or UOV, would be particularly well-suited. For the other signatures, the public key is included, and it’s more important to minimize the sizes of the combined public key and signature.</p><p>The handshake signature is the only signature that is created online — all the other signatures are created ahead of time.  The handshake signature is created and verified only once, whereas the other signatures are typically verified many times by different clients. This means that for the handshake signature, it’s advantageous to balance signing and verification time which are both in the <i>hot path</i>, whereas for the other signatures having better verification time at the cost of slower signing is worthwhile. This is one of the advantages RSA still enjoys over elliptic curve signatures today.</p><p>Putting together different signature schemes is a fun puzzle, but it also comes with some drawbacks. Using multiple different schemes increases the attack surface because an algorithmic or implementation vulnerability in one compromises the whole. Also, the whole ecosystem needs to implement and optimize multiple algorithms, which is a significant burden.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"putting-it-together\">Putting it together</h2>\n      <a href=\"#putting-it-together\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>So, what are some reasonable combinations to try?</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"with-nists-current-picks\">With NIST’s current picks</h3>\n      <a href=\"#with-nists-current-picks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>With the draft standards available today, we do not have a lot of options.</p><p>If we simply switch to ML-DSA-44 for all signatures, we’re adding 15kB of data that needs to be transmitted from the server to the client during the TLS handshake.

Unfortunately, the computation required for signing, and crucially verification, are too high. SQISign is in a worse position than FN-DSA with implementation security: it’s very complicated and it’s unclear how to perform signing in <i>constant time</i>. For niche applications, SQISign might be useful, but for general adoption verification times need to improve significantly, even if that requires a larger signature. Over the last few years there has been amazing progress in improving verification time; simplifying the algorithm; and <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/832\"><u>implementation security</u></a> for (variants of) SQISign. They’re not there yet, but the gap has shrunk much more than we’d have expected. If the pace of improvement holds, then a future SQISign could well be viable for TLS.</p><p>One conservative contender is <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48910-X_15\"><u>UOV (unbalanced oil and vinegar)</u></a>. It is an old multivariate scheme with a large public key (66.5kB), but small signatures (96 bytes). Over the decades, there have been many attempts to add some structure to UOV public keys, to get a better balance between public key and signature size. Many of these so-called <i>structured multivariate </i>schemes, which includes Rainbow and GeMMS, unfortunately have been broken dramatically <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214.pdf\"><u>“with a laptop over the weekend”</u></a>. MAYO and SNOVA, which we’ll get to in a bit, are the latest attempts at structured multivariate. UOV itself has remained mostly unscathed. Surprisingly in 2025, Lars Ran found a completely new <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1143\"><u>“wedges” attack</u></a> on UOV. It doesn’t affect UOV much, although SNOVA and MAYO are hit harder. Why the attack is noteworthy, is that it’s based on a relatively simple idea: it is surprising it wasn’t found before. Now, getting back to performance: if we combine UOV for the root and SCTs with ML-DSA-44 for the others, we’re looking at only 10kB — close to FN-DSA-512.</p><p>Now, let’s turn to the main event:</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-fight-between-mayo-versus-snova\">The fight between MAYO versus SNOVA</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-fight-between-mayo-versus-snova\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Looking at the roster today, MAYO and particularly SNOVA look great from a performance standpoint. Last year, SNOVA and MAYO were closer in performance, but they have diverged quite a bit.</p><p><a href=\"https://pqmayo.org/\"><u>MAYO</u></a> is designed by the cryptographer that broke <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214.pdf\"><u>Rainbow</u></a>. As a structured multivariate scheme, its security requires careful scrutiny, but its utility (assuming it is not broken) is very appealing. MAYO allows for a fine-grained tradeoff between signature and public key size. For the submission, to keep things simple, the authors proposed two concrete variants: MAYO<sub>one</sub> with balanced signature (454 bytes) and public key (1.4kB) sizes, and MAYO<sub>two</sub> that has signatures of 216 bytes, while keeping the public key manageable at 4.3kB. Verification times are excellent, while signing times are somewhat slower than ECDSA, but far better than RSA. Combining both variants in the obvious way, we’re only looking at 4.3kB. These numbers are a bit higher than last year, as MAYO adjusted its parameters again slightly to account for newly discovered attacks.</p><p>Over the competition, <a href=\"https://snova.pqclab.org/\"><u>SNOVA</u></a> has been hit harder by attacks than MAYO. SNOVA’s response has been more aggressive: instead of just tweaking parameters to adjust, they have also made larger changes to the internals of the scheme, to counter the attacks and to get a performance improvement to boot. Combining SNOVA<sub>(37,17,16,2)</sub> and SNOVA<sub>(24,5,23,4)</sub> in the obvious way, we’re looking at adding just an amazing 2.1kB.</p><p>We see a face-off shaping up between the risky but much smaller SNOVA, and the conservative but slower MAYO. Zooming out, both have very welcome performance, and both are too risky to deploy now. Ran’s new wedges attack is an example that the field of multivariate cryptanalysis still holds surprises, and needs more eyes and time. It’s too soon to pick a winner between SNOVA and MAYO: let them continue to compete. Even if they turn out to be secure, neither is likely to be standardized by 2029, which means we cannot rely on them for the initial migration to post-quantum authentication.</p><p>Stepping back, is the 15kB for ML-DSA-44 actually that bad?</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"do-we-really-care-about-the-extra-bytes\">Do we really care about the extra bytes?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#do-we-really-care-about-the-extra-bytes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>On average, around 18 million TLS connections are established with Cloudflare per second. Upgrading each to ML-DSA, would take 2.1Tbps, which is 0.5% of our current total network capacity. No problem so far. The question is how these extra bytes affect performance.</p><p>It will take 15kB extra to swap in ML-DSA-44. That’s a lot compared to the typical handshake today, but it’s not a lot compared to the JavaScript and images served on many web pages. The key point is that the change we must make here affects every single TLS connection, whether it’s used for a bloated website, or a time-critical API call. Also, it’s not just about waiting a bit longer. If you have spotty cellular reception, that extra data can make the difference between being able to load a page, and having the connection time out. (As an aside, talking about bloat: many apps perform a <a href=\"https://thomwiggers.nl/publication/tls-on-android/tls-on-android.pdf\"><u>surprisingly high number of TLS handshakes</u></a>).</p><p>Just like with key agreement, performance isn’t our only concern: we also want the connection to succeed in the first place. Back in 2021, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/sizing-up-post-quantum-signatures/\"><u>we ran an experiment</u></a> artificially enlarging the certificate chain to simulate larger post-quantum certificates. We summarize the result <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/#do-we-really-care-about-the-extra-bytes\"><u>here</u></a>. One key take-away is that some clients or middleboxes don’t like certificate chains larger than 10kB. This is problematic for a <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/063.pdf\"><u>single-certificate migration</u></a> strategy. In this approach, the server installs a single traditional certificate that contains a separate post-quantum certificate in a so-called non-critical extension. A client that does not support post-quantum certificates will ignore the extension. In this approach, installing the single certificate will immediately break all clients with compatibility issues, making it a non-starter. On the performance side there is also a steep drop in performance at 10kB because of the initial congestion window.</p><p>\n</p><p>Is 9kB too much? The slowdown in TLS handshake time would be approximately 15%. We felt the latter is workable, but far from ideal: such a slowdown is noticeable and people might hold off deploying post-quantum certificates before it’s too late.\n</p><p>Chrome is more cautious and set 10% as their target for maximum TLS handshake time regression. They <a href=\"https://dadrian.io/blog/posts/pqc-signatures-2024/#fnref:3\"><u>report</u></a> that deploying post-quantum key agreement has already incurred a 4% slowdown in TLS handshake time, for the extra 1.1kB from server-to-client and 1.2kB from client-to-server. That slowdown is proportionally larger than the 15% we found for 9kB, but that could be explained by slower upload speeds than download speeds. </p><p>There has been pushback against the focus on TLS handshake times. One argument is that session resumption alleviates the need for sending the certificates again. A second argument is that the data required to visit a typical website dwarfs the additional bytes for post-quantum certificates. One example is this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.science/publications/the-impact-of-data-heavy-post-quantum-tls-1-3-on-the-time-to-last-byte-of-real-world-connections\"><u>2024 publication</u></a>, where Amazon researchers have simulated the impact of large post-quantum certificates on data-heavy TLS connections. They argue that typical connections transfer multiple requests and hundreds of kilobytes, and for those the TLS handshake slowdown disappears in the margin.</p><p>Are session resumption and hundreds of kilobytes over a connection typical though? We’d like to share what we see. We focus on QUIC connections, which are likely initiated by browsers or browser-like clients. Of all QUIC connections with Cloudflare that carry at least one HTTP request, 27% are <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/even-faster-connection-establishment-with-quic-0-rtt-resumption/\"><u>resumptions</u></a>, meaning that key material from a previous TLS connection is reused, avoiding the need to transmit certificates. The median number of bytes transferred from server-to-client over a resumed QUIC connection is 4.4kB, while the average is 259kB. For non-resumptions the median is 8.1kB and average is 583kB. This vast difference between median and average indicates that a small fraction of data-heavy connections skew the average. In fact, only 15.5% of all QUIC connections transfer more than 100kB.</p><p>The median certificate chain today (with compression) is <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tls-cert-abridge-02#section-4\"><u>3.2kB</u></a>. That means that almost 40% of all data transferred from server to client on more than half of the non-resumed QUIC connections are just for the certificates, and this only gets worse with post-quantum algorithms. For the majority of QUIC connections, using ML-DSA-44 as a drop-in replacement for classical signatures would more than double the number of transmitted bytes over the lifetime of the connection.</p><p>It sounds quite bad if the vast majority of data transferred for a typical connection is just for the post-quantum certificates. It’s still only a proxy for what is actually important: the effect on metrics relevant to the end-user, such as the browsing experience (e.g. <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/optimize-lcp\"><u>largest contentful paint</u></a>) and the amount of data those certificates take from a user’s monthly data cap. We will continue to investigate and get a better understanding of the impact.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"way-forward-for-post-quantum-authentication\">Way forward for post-quantum authentication</h2>\n      <a href=\"#way-forward-for-post-quantum-authentication\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The path for migrating the Internet to post-quantum authentication is much less clear than with key agreement. Unless we can get performance much closer to today’s authentication, we expect the vast majority to keep post-quantum authentication disabled. Postponing enabling post-quantum authentication until Q-day draws near carries a real risk that we will not see the issues before it’s too late to fix. That’s why it’s essential to make post-quantum authentication performant enough to be turned on by default.</p><p>We’re exploring various ideas to reduce the number of signatures, in increasing order of ambition: leaving out intermediates; KEMTLS; and Merkle Tree Certificates. We covered these in <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/#reducing-number-of-signatures\"><u>detail last year</u></a>. Most progress has been made on the last one: <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/\"><u>Merkle Tree Certificates</u></a> (MTC). In this proposal, in the common case, all signatures except the handshake signature are replaced by a short &lt;800 byte Merkle tree proof. This could well allow for post-quantum authentication that’s actually faster than using traditional certificates today!

Although important, TLS is not the only protocol key to the security of the Internet. We want to briefly mention a few other challenges, but cannot go into detail. One particular challenge is DNSSEC, which is responsible for securing the resolution of domain names.</p><p>Although key agreement and signatures are the most widely used cryptographic primitives, over the last few years we have seen the adoption of more <a href=\"https://github.com/fancy-cryptography/fancy-cryptography\"><u>esoteric cryptography</u></a> to serve more advanced use cases, such as unlinkable tokens with <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-pass-standard\"><u>Privacy Pass</u></a> / <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standardhttps://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard\"><u>PAT</u></a>, anonymous credentials, and <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-geo-key-manager-v2\"><u>attribute based encryption</u></a> to name a few.

That means that with the quick adoption (we’re <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/post-quantum-cryptography/pqc-support/\"><u>keeping a list</u></a>) of X25519MLKEM768 across software and services, you might well be secure already against store-now/decrypt-later! On Cloudflare Radar you can <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#browser-support\"><u>check</u></a> whether your browser supports X25519MLKEM768; if you use Firefox, there is <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pqspy/\"><u>an extension</u></a> to check support of websites while you visit; you can scan whether your website supports it <a href=\"https://pqscan.io/\"><u>here</u></a>; and you can use Wireshark to check for it <a href=\"https://www.netmeister.org/blog/tls-hybrid-kex.html\"><u>on the wire</u></a>.</p><p>Those are just spot checks. For a proper migration, you’ll need to figure out where cryptography is used. That’s a tall order, as most organizations have a hard time tracking all software, services, and external vendors they use in the first place. There will be systems that are difficult to upgrade or have external dependencies, but in many cases it’s simple. In fact, in many cases, you’ll spend a lot of time to find out that they are already done.</p><p>As figuring out <i>what to do</i> is the bulk of the work, it’s perhaps tempting to split that out as a first milestone: create a detailed inventory first; the so-called <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM/CBOM\"><u>cryptographic bill of materials</u></a> (CBOM). Don’t let an inventory become a goal on its own: we need to keep our eyes on the ball. Most cases are easy: if you figured out what to do to migrate in one case, don’t wait and context switch, but just do it. That doesn’t mean it’ll be fast: this is a marathon not a sprint, but you’ll be surprised how much ground can be covered by getting started.</p><p><b>Certificates.</b> At the time of writing this blog in October 2025, the final standards for post-quantum certificates are not set yet. Hopefully that won’t take too long to resolve. But there is much that you can do now to prepare for post-quantum certificates that you won’t regret at all. Keep software up-to-date. Automate certificate issuance. Ensure you can install multiple certificates.</p><p>In case you’re worried about protocol ossification, there is no reason to wait: the final post-quantum standards will not be very different from the draft. You can test with preliminary implementations (or large dummy certificates) today.</p><p>The post-quantum migration is quite unique. Typically, if cryptography is broken, it’s either sudden or gradually making it easy to ignore for a time. In both cases, migrations in the end are rushed. With the quantum threat, we know for sure that we’ll need to replace a lot of cryptography, but we also have time. Instead of just a chore, we invite you to see this as an opportunity: we have to do maintenance now on many systems that rarely get touched. Instead of just hotfixes, now is the opportunity to rethink past choices. </p><p>At least, if you start now. Good luck with your migration, and if you hit any issues, do reach out: ask-research@cloudflare.com</p>",
