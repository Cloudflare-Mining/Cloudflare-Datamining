Compromises can in fact lead to complete application take over and data exfiltration resulting in financial and reputational damage to the targeted organization.</p><p>The Log4Shell criterion in the Forrester Wave report is an excellent example of a real world use case to demonstrate this value.</p><p><a href=\"/inside-the-log4j2-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/\">Log4Shell</a> was a high severity vulnerability discovered in December 2021 that affected the popular <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/\">Apache Log4J software</a> commonly used by applications to implement logging functionality. The vulnerability, when exploited, allows an attacker to perform remote code execution and consequently take over the target application.</p><p>Due to the popularity of this software component, many organizations worldwide were potentially at risk after the immediate public announcement of the vulnerability on December 9, 2021.</p><p>We believe that we scored the highest possible score in the Log4Shell criterion due to our <a href=\"/cve-2021-44228-log4j-rce-0-day-mitigation/\">fast response</a> to the announcement, by ensuring that all customers using the Cloudflare WAF were protected against the exploit in less than 17 hours globally.</p><p>We did this by deploying new managed rules (virtual patching) that were made available to all customers. The rules were deployed with a block action ensuring exploit attempts never reached customer applications.</p><p>Additionally, our continuous public updates on the subject, including regarding <a href=\"/how-cloudflare-security-responded-to-log4j2-vulnerability/\">internal processes</a>, helped create clarity and understanding around the <a href=\"/exploitation-of-cve-2021-44228-before-public-disclosure-and-evolution-of-waf-evasion-patterns/\">severity of the issue</a> and <a href=\"/secure-how-your-servers-connect-to-the-internet-today/\">remediation steps</a>.</p><p>In the following weeks from the initial announcement, we <a href=\"/protection-against-cve-2021-45046-the-additional-log4j-rce-vulnerability/\">updated WAF rules several times</a> following discovery of multiple <a href=\"/actual-cve-2021-44228-payloads-captured-in-the-wild/\">variations of the attack payloads</a>.</p><p>The Cloudflare WAF ultimately “bought” valuable time for our customers to patch their back end systems before attackers may have been able to find and attempt compromise of vulnerable applications.</p><p>You can read about our response and our actions following the Log4Shell announcement in great detail on <a href=\"/tag/log4j/\">our blog</a>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"use-the-cloudflare-waf-today\">Use the Cloudflare WAF today</h3>\n      <a href=\"#use-the-cloudflare-waf-today\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare WAF keeps organizations safer while they focus on improving their applications and APIs.
