Cloudflare offers a comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/\">Bot Management tool</a> for Enterprise customers, along with an effective free tool called Bot Fight Mode. Because of the tremendous amount of traffic that flows through our network each day, Cloudflare is in a unique position to analyze global bot trends.</p><p>In this post, we will cover the basics of bot traffic and distinguish between automated requests and other human requests (<b>What Is A Bot?)</b>. Then, we’ll move on to a global overview of bot traffic around the world (<b>A RoboBird’s Eye View, A Bot Day</b> and <b>Bots All Over The World</b>), and dive into North American traffic (<b>A Look into North American Traffic)</b>.  Lastly, we’ll finish with an overview of how the coronavirus pandemic affected global traffic, and we’ll take a deeper look at European traffic (<b>Bots During COVID-19 In Europe)</b>.</p><p>On average, Cloudflare processes 18 million HTTP requests every second. This is a great opportunity to understand how bots shape the Internet, how much infrastructure is dedicated to these automated requests, and why our customers need a great bot management solution.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"what-is-a-bot\">What Is A Bot?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#what-is-a-bot\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5WDMsOvCcXwNaDjyPyDA4P/7cc3cda63d10b7ca72e608d3bd60bcbc/image3-19.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"732\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Cloudflare groups traffic into four bot-related categories:</p><p>1. Verified2. Definitely automated3. Likely automated4. Likely human</p><p>Our goal is to stop malicious and unwanted bots from harming our customers, while giving customers the opportunity to control how other automated traffic is managed.</p><p>We label each request that comes into Cloudflare with a “bot score” 1 through 99, where a lower score means that a request probably came from a bot. A higher score means that a request probably came from a human. This score is available in our Firewall, logs, and Workers, giving customers the flexibility to act on any score.</p><p>Cloudflare also maintains a challenge platform that customers can choose to deploy on suspected bots. You’ll recognize these as CAPTCHA challenges or JavaScript challenges. In fact, having the score available in Firewall Rules means that customers can take any action they choose. This platform can be used for mitigation, ensuring that unwanted traffic is stopped in its tracks.</p><p>To learn more about how Bot Management interacts with our firewall, check out our <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027519452-Understanding-Cloudflare-Bot-Management\">support page</a>.</p><p>We track successes and failures during these challenges, which ultimately allows us to improve our detection systems. Assuming that our challenges are solvable by humans, effective detections should have low solve rates, given that they are usually presented to bots.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3n79MsY5KEtsHVDMrKUAIc/c98fbe756b008f48c283006d65bb178a/image15-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1810\" height=\"732\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Verified</b> bots are registered in an internal verified bot directory. These good bots power search engines and monitoring tools. Good bots enable our customers’ web pages to be found by search engines, for example.</p><p>For known non-verified bots (such as a scraper using a simple curl library), we keep a similar directory that is managed by our heuristics engine. If not otherwise verified, we consider requests caught by this engine to be <b>definitely automated</b>.</p><p>Our machine learning engine provides another way to identify potential bots. This engine identifies requests with a high probability of automation and marks them as <b>likely automated</b>. This detection mechanism benefits from models built on data from our global network.</p><p>If a request is not marked as automated, we mark it as <b>likely human</b> and pass along the bot score from our machine learning system.</p><p>We also have a behavioral analysis engine and a JavaScript detections engine. You can learn more about these systems by checking out <a href=\"/cloudflare-bot-management-machine-learning-and-more/\">Alex Bocharov’s previous post</a> on Cloudflare Bot Management.</p><p>The two bot definitions for automated traffic are somewhat complementary. Requests caught by heuristic detections will not count towards machine learning detections. Requests that are reliably caught by our machine learning detections won’t need to be registered in our known heuristics bot directory. Because of this, we combine these two together when we discuss “automated traffic” in general.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"a-robobirds-eye-view\">A RoboBird’s Eye View</h3>\n      <a href=\"#a-robobirds-eye-view\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Data from this piece comes from information about Cloudflare’s customers, analyzed between January 15, 2020 and July 31, 2020.</p><p>First, let’s get a basic understanding of the traffic on our network.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6ZbothlOCfZiBnRIJuRhg1/6a5a48f9e51c4a7a9220668e3cc821b8/image6-9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"715\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Figure 1.1</b> Traffic type on Cloudflare’s network.</p><p>Figure 1.1 has a global breakdown regarding classification; 60.6% of traffic is likely human, 19.3% is likely automated, 18.1% is definitely automated and only 2.1% is from verified bots.

Do bots follow suit? Let’s check. Figure 2.1 represents traffic deviation from the average hourly traffic. An increase of 10% would mean that the hour is 10% busier than the average hour (measuring requests per hour). We include the total overall traffic in this chart to serve as a comparison to other types of traffic.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5Ce2GsyZWSptrwxEvizyLI/d5460319c397f6173c95d01ce6e18d58/image19-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"724\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Figure 2.1</b> Hourly traffic as a deviation from the average hour.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7UoVmHAH5keWrT4ol6kUg/b0fdd70f9dbe9a0d41c4c24b1e98094a/image4-14.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"736\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Figure 2.2</b> Bot classification over an average day. </p><p>We can clearly see a difference between human traffic and bot traffic. Human traffic varies heavily, but predictably, throughout the day. We can see a 15% decrease in human traffic early in the day, between midnight and 05:00 UTC, corresponding to the end of business hours in the Americas, and up to a 25% increase during business hours, 14:00 to 17:00 UTC, where traffic is highest. Conversely, bot traffic is more consistent. Slow hours still see a smaller drop than overall traffic, and busy hours are less busy. The difference between good and bad bots is also apparent: good bots are even more consistent, with small fluctuations in hourly traffic.</p><p>But why would this happen? A large portion of bots, good and bad, perform the same task across the Internet. Bad bots may be scraping websites or looking to infect unprotected machines, and they will do this with little intervention from human operators. Good bots could be doing some of these operations, but less frequently and in a more targeted fashion. A good bot scraping a website may be doing so to add it to a search engine, while a bad bot will do the same thing at a much higher rate, for other reasons.</p><p>A lot of bots follow business hours. For example, sneaker bots—focused on nabbing exclusive items from sneaker stores—will naturally be active when new products launch.</p><p>This difference in volume does not mean that our classifications are affected: our scores remain consistent throughout the day, as Figure 2.1 shows.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2FGicO2LIu6u59W0x6SJOD/16329cc40a575612e187923fbc51f681/image14-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"730\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b><i>Figure 2.3</i></b><i> Daily traffic as a deviation from the average day.

Weekdays and weekends have fairly marked differences for most traffic, but good bots keep a consistent schedule. Whereas a typical weekday is slightly above average, we can see a drop of about 4% in overall traffic. This does not fully apply to verified bots, which only see a small 1% drop in traffic.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"bots-all-over-the-world\">Bots All Over The World</h3>\n      <a href=\"#bots-all-over-the-world\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Now that we’ve taken a look at global traffic, let’s dig a little deeper.</p><p>Different regions have distinct traffic landscapes regarding automated traffic.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3UEGzJ3XAHef2PX9QPk2qK/f0ea848dd3dcd85af59de5f65dc25f59/image18-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"571\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>**</i><b>Figure 3.1</b><i>** </i><i><i>Traffic type by region</i></i><i>.</i></p><p>Figure 3.1 breaks down traffic by region, letting us peek into where each type of traffic comes from.

Conversely, Canadian traffic is more likely to be human.</p><p>Let&#39;s take another look at each country.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5WoxVVla9ULSUap7HvYvZj/9d18a927e8dce75842593caa314d0c57/image5-9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"599\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b><i>Figure 3.4</i></b><i> Percentage of traffic within each country.</i></p><p>Over half of the traffic from the United States is automated in some way, which is a clear departure from trends in Mexico and Canada.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"american-bots\">American Bots</h3>\n      <a href=\"#american-bots\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>So far, we’ve seen how much the United States contributes to automated traffic. If we want to go deeper, a good place to start is by understanding how these bots get online. We can do this by examining the networks from which the traffic originates. Networks are identified by Autonomous System Numbers, or ASNs. These form the backbone of the Internet infrastructure.</p><p>Think of these as Internet Service Providers, but facing inward towards the network instead of outward towards end consumers. ISPs like Comcast and Verizon are examples of residential ASNs, where we expect mostly human traffic. Cloud providers such as Google and Amazon are also ASNs, but targeted towards cloud services. We expect most of these requests to be automated in some way.</p><p>Looking at traffic on the ASN level is important because we can identify cloud-based traffic, or traffic using residential proxies, among others.</p><p>Let&#39;s take a look at which ASNs are associated with visitors in the United States. We’ll restrict ourselves to “eyeball” traffic, which is the term we use for requests coming from site visitors.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6vfhm7SZ899H8ancIgAVq1/5e9d99cd234cfa1d767478364daaa958/image21.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"587\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b><i>Figure 4.1</i></b><i> Top ASN in the United States.</i></p><p>From figure 4.1 we can clearly see the impact that cloud services have on traffic; 11.5% of all eyeball traffic comes from Amazon and Google.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/42Vx0NeK5gy4izAtyuHtXq/fb6c4372cac1cf0baac681763bccb3c8/image22.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"595\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b><i>Figure 4.2</i></b><i> Top ASN in the United States for verified bot traffic.</i></p><p>Verified bots operate in a different landscape, coming from cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Advanced Hosting and Wowrack.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3hX8AfhmPJkiAINQjXzlyx/d7ca84aa40a84840b3c19676ceab6034/image8-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"578\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b><i>Figure 4.3</i></b><i> Top ASN in the United States for likely and definitely automated traffic.</i></p><p>Automated traffic has a variety of ASNs.

Many people have been working from home, and even those who do not have this option are using the Internet in new ways. Overall, this has meant that Cloudflare’s network has grown tremendously.</p><p>But how does this impact bot traffic? First let’s get an idea of how it impacted traffic in general. Countries were impacted by the virus at different times, so we expect to see differences, right?</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3rzZx17XrGONvWYx1OjhQO/bf0c3001fd9248f17d64294ec9e9342c/image1-30.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1247\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Figure 5.1</b> <i>Total traffic across all regions.</i></p><p>Figure 5.1 has just the traffic increase.

For comparison, we have overall European traffic, and three selected countries: Italy, the United Kingdom and Portugal. Italy was picked because it was one of the first countries in Europe to face the worst of the coronavirus and enact lockdown measures. The United Kingdom took another strategy, with an initial focus on herd immunity, and enacted measures later than the others. Portugal is somewhere in between, locking down later than Italy, in slightly different circumstances.</p><p>At the beginning of the year, traffic kept stable and fluctuations kept in line with the European average. As lockdown measures began, traffic increased. Italy was first out of these countries, rising a few weeks before the others, and keeping well above average. Eventually, all countries saw a growth in traffic, followed by a stabilization. Italy seems to have adjusted to a normal, with its growth in line with the European average. Portugal has also stabilized, but with busier weekdays. Conversely, the United Kingdom showed no signs of stopping, exceeding a growth of 40% compared to the beginning of the year.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/KcqhhSQl2Yyw6djCq0q3C/eac537624b912058a7522e8e7fa28f95/image17-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"707\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b><i>Figure 5.3</i></b><i> Daily definitely automated traffic evolution for Italy, the United Kingdom and Portugal, overlaid with Europe.</i></p><p>Definitely automated traffic did not have that much of a pronounced variation.
