We know that’s a pain, especially for our Enterprise customers. That’s why last September we announced the <a href=\"/account-waf/\">Account WAF</a>, where you can create one security rule and have it applied to the configuration of all your zones at once!</p><p>Account WAF makes it easy to deploy security configurations. Following the same philosophy, we want to empower our customers by providing visibility over these configurations, or even better, visibility on all HTTP traffic.</p><p>Today, Cloudflare is offering holistic views on the security suite by launching Account Security Analytics and Account Security Events.

This step is essential in distinguishing between actual threats from false positives, along with maintaining optimal security configuration.</p><p>Part of the Security Events power is showing Events “by service” listing the security-related activity per security feature (for example, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">WAF</a>, Firewall Rules, API Shield) and Events “by Action” (for example, allow, block, challenge).</p><p>On the other hand, Account Security Analytics view shows a wider angle with all HTTP traffic on all zones under the account, whether this traffic is mitigated, i.e., the security configurations took an action to prevent the request from reaching your zone, or not mitigated. This is essential in fine-tuning your security configuration, finding possible false negatives, or onboarding new zones.</p><p>The view also provides quick filters or insights of what we think are interesting cases worth exploring for ease of use. Many of the view components are similar to zone level <a href=\"/security-analytics/\">Security Analytics</a> that we introduced recently.</p><p>To get to know the components and how they interact, let’s have a look at an actual example.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"analytics-walk-through-when-investigating-a-spike-in-traffic\">Analytics walk-through when investigating a spike in traffic</h3>\n      <a href=\"#analytics-walk-through-when-investigating-a-spike-in-traffic\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Traffic spikes happen to many customers’ accounts; to investigate the reason behind them, and check what’s missing from the configurations, we recommend starting from Analytics as it shows mitigated and non-mitigated traffic, and to revise the mitigated requests to double check any false positives then Security Events is the go to place.
