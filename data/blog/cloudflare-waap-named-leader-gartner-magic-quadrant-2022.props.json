To showcase our speed of innovation, here is a selection of our top picks:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"/protecting-apis-from-abuse-and-data-exfiltration/\">API Shield Schema Protection</a>: traditional signature based WAF approaches (negative security model) don’t always work well with well-structured data such as API traffic. Given the fast growth in API traffic across the network we built a new incremental product that allows you to enforce API schemas directly at the edge using a positive security model: only let well-formed data through to your origin web servers;</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/api-abuse-detection/\">API Abuse Detection</a>: complementary to API Schema Protection, API Abuse Detection warns you whenever anomalies are detected on your API endpoints. These can be triggered by unusual traffic flows or patterns that don’t follow normal traffic activity;</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/new-cloudflare-waf/\">Our new Web Application Firewall</a>: built on top of our new Edge Rules Engine, the core Web Application Firewall received a complete overhaul, all the way from engine internals to the UI. Better performance both in terms of latency and efficacy at blocking malicious payloads, along with brand-new capabilities including but not limited to Exposed Credential Checks, account wide configurations and payload logging;</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/http-ddos-managed-rules/\">DDoS customizable Managed Rules</a>: to provide additional configuration flexibility, we started exposing some of our internal DDoS mitigation managed rules for custom configurations to further reduce false positives and allow customers to increase thresholds / detections as required;</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/security-center/\">Security Center</a>: Cloudflare view on infrastructure and network assets, along with alerts and notifications for miss configurations and potential security issues;</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/page-shield-generally-available/\">Page Shield</a>: based on growing customer demand and the rise of attack vectors focusing on the end user browser environment, Page Shield helps you detect whenever malicious JavaScript may have made its way into your application’s code;</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/api-gateway/\">API Gateway</a>: full <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/api-gateway/\">API management</a>, including routing directly from the Cloudflare edge, with API Security baked in, including encryption and mutual TLS authentication (mTLS);</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/waf-ml/\">Machine Learning WAF</a>: complementary to our WAF Managed Rulesets, our new ML WAF engine, scores every single request from 1 (clean) to 99 (malicious) giving you additional visibility in both valid and non-valid malicious payloads increasing our ability to detect targeted attacks and scans towards your application;</p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking forward</h2>\n      <a href=\"#looking-forward\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Our roadmap is packed with both new application security features and improvements to existing systems.
