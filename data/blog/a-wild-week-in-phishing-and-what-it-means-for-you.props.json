In more than 90% of cybersecurity incidents, phishing is the root cause of the attack, and during this third week of August phishing attacks were reported <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-campaign-hacking-iran-769d8411d9a13ef9a0e039c0b6c3b032\"><u>against the U.S. elections</u></a>, in the <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/iranian-backed-group-steps-up-phishing-campaigns-against-israel-us/\"><u>geopolitical conflict</u></a> between the U.S., Israel, and Iran, and to cause <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1609804/000095014224002170/eh240519238_8k.htm\"><u>$60M in corporate losses</u></a>.</p><p>You might think that after 30 years of email being the top vector for attack and risk we are helpless to do anything about it, but that would be giving too much credit to bad actors, and a misunderstanding of how defenders focused on detections can take control and win. </p><p>Phishing isn’t about email exclusively, or any specific protocol for that matter. Simply put, it is an attempt to get a person, like you or me, to take an action that unwittingly leads to damages. These attacks work because they appear to be authentic, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/50-most-impersonated-brands-protect-phishing\"><u>visually</u></a> or organizationally, such as pretending to be the CEO or CFO of your company, and when you break it down they are <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/2023-phishing-report\"><u>three main attack vectors that Cloudflare has seen most impactfu</u></a>l from the bad emails we protect our customers from: 1. Clicking links (deceptive links are 35.6% of threat indicators) 2. Downloading files or malware  (malicious attachments are 1.9% of threat indicators) 3. Business email compromise (BEC) phishing that elicits money or intellectual property with no links or files (0.5% of threat indicators).</p><p>Today, we at Cloudflare see an increase in what we’ve termed multi-channel phishing. What other channels are there to send links, files and elicit BEC actions? There’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS\"><u>SMS</u></a> (text messaging) and public and private messaging applications, which are increasingly common attack vectors that take advantage of the ability to send links over those channels, and also how people consume information and work. There’s cloud collaboration, where attackers rely on links, files, and BEC phishing on commonly used collaboration tools like Google Workspace, Atlassian, and Microsoft Office 365. And finally, there’s web and social phishing targeting people on LinkedIn and X. Ultimately, any attempt to stop phishing needs to be comprehensive enough to detect and protect against these different vectors.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/79OaEpiIHsCnTgkj7k89Yi/6f7f413ec1bca40e6e00b60863ee2e4e/2504-2.png\" alt=\"2504-2\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1201\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sub><i>Learn more about these technologies and products </i></sub><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/\"><sub><i><u>here</u></i></sub></a><sub></sub></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"a-real-example\">A real example</h3>\n      <a href=\"#a-real-example\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>It’s one thing to tell you this, but we’d love to give you an example of how a multi-channel phish plays out with a sophisticated attacker.</p><p>Here’s an email message that an executive notices is in their junk folder. That’s because our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/\"><u>Email Security</u></a> product noticed there’s something off about it and moved it there, but it relates to a project the executive is working on, so the executive thinks it’s legitimate. There’s a request for a company org chart, and the attacker knows that this is the kind of thing that’s going to be caught if they continue on email, so they include a link to a real Google form:</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3RyRiXtEtUg4PsZZ7yoEpY/c0a09b8d47d09b3b306b99d4cc5b667b/2504-3.png\" alt=\"2504-3\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1338\" height=\"672\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><ul><li><p>The executive clicks the link, and because it is a legitimate Google form, it displays the following:</p></li></ul>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2szWX4dGovtdUjDzcRMQxt/6e0e5414ed84cac77c17667e668933a1/2504-4.png\" alt=\"2504-4\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1191\" height=\"673\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><ul><li><p>There’s a request to upload the org chart here, and that’s what they try to do:</p></li></ul><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https://customer-eq7kiuol0tk9chox.cloudflarestream.com/22002c526923c8504a5b6dad12774605/iframe?preload=true&loop=true&autoplay=true&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fcustomer-eq7kiuol0tk9chox.cloudflarestream.com%2F22002c526923c8504a5b6dad12774605%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D%26height%3D600\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\"\n    allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n  ></iframe>\n</div><ul><li><p>The executive drags it in, but it doesn’t finish uploading because in the document there is an “internal only” watermark that our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/gateway/\"><u>Gateway</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/dlp/\"><u>digital loss prevention (DLP)</u></a> engine detected, which in turn prevented the upload.</p></li><li><p>Sophisticated attackers use urgency to drive better outcomes.
