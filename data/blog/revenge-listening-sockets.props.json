Among other things we measured <code>ping</code> times to our edge servers. While the worst case improved and we didn&#39;t see 1000ms+ pings anymore, the line still wasn&#39;t flat. Here&#39;s a graph of ping latency between an idling internal machine and a production server. The test was done within the datacenter, the packets never went to the public internet. The Y axis of the chart shows <code>ping</code> times in milliseconds, the X axis is the time of the measurement. Measurements were taken every second for over 6 hours:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1XHIKdZc7gzLfYQHJOqlvn/61047e9477c5923c552b01aa49750200/ping-48m4-csv-before.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As you can see most pings finished below 1ms.

We found that <a href=\"http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c?v=3.18#L1585\"><code>tcp_v4_rcv</code></a> had a similarly poor latency distribution. More specifically the problem lies between lines 1637 and 1642 in the <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code> function in the <code>tcp_ipv4.c</code> file. We wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2016-04-bind-to-star/histogram-kernel2.stp\">another script to show</a> just that:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2YByqoyG6F8kapoqFISNcG/26eb861a2d9e07747d70c4b13e2fadf5/a-tcp.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1069\" height=\"494\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The latency is created at this specific line in <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code> function:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.c\"><code class=\"language-.c\">sk = __inet_lookup_skb(&amp;tcp_hashinfo, skb, th-&gt;source, th-&gt;dest);</pre></code>\n            <p>The numbers shown above indicate that the function usually terminated quickly, in under 2us, but sometimes it hit a slow path and took 1-2ms to finish.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/net/inet_hashtables.h?v=3.18#L343\"><code>__inet_lookup_skb</code></a> is inlined which makes it tricky to accurately measure. Fortunately the function is simple - all it does is to call <code>__inet_lookup_established</code> and <code>__inet_lookup_listener</code>. It&#39;s the latter function that was causing the trouble:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4IcyrSCQ0rO6dGDDMJIYAw/f86a763d330e26fde206d51de3ed1ad6/a-tcp-copy.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1069\" height=\"447\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Let&#39;s discuss how <code>__inet_lookup</code> works. This function tries to find an appropriate connection <code>sock struct</code> structure for a packet. This is done in the <code>__inet_lookup_established</code> call. If that fails, the <code>__inet_lookup</code> will attempt to find a bound socket in listening state that could potentially handle the packet. For example, if the packet is SYN and the listening socket exists we should respond with SYN+ACK. If there is no bound listening socket we should send an RST instead. The <code>__inet_lookup_listener</code> function finds the bound socket in the <code>LHTABLE</code> hash table. It does so by using the destination port as a hash and picks an appropriate bucket in the hash table. Then it iterates over it linearly to find the matching listening socket.</p><p>To understand the problem we traced the slow packets, with <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2016-04-bind-to-star/duration-inet-lookup2.stp\">another crafted system tap script</a>. It hooks onto <code>__inet_lookup_listener</code> and prints out the details of only the slow packets:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3OBYuGrWgdW7nOI1bp4ZIi/4cb7a50dbe9e2a2af3fc44be6e54790c/a-inet.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1069\" height=\"313\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>With this data we went deeper and matched these log lines to specific packets captured with <code>tcpdump</code>.

Among many other requirements, the server is designed to withstand DDoS attacks.</p><p>Even though our server is pretty fast, when a large attack kicks in it might be unable to cope with the attack load. If that happens we must contain the damage - even if one IP address is under a heavy attack the server must still handle legitimate traffic on other IP addresses. In fact, our DNS architecture is designed to spread the load among 16k IP addresses.</p><p>When <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/under-attack/\">an IP address is under attack</a>, and the server is not keeping up with incoming packets, the kernel receive queue on a UDP socket will overflow. We monitor that by looking at the <code>netstat</code> counters:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ netstat -s --udp\nUdp:\n    43957575 packet receive errors</pre></code>\n            <p>With that number increasing we can see the affected IP addresses by listing the UDP sockets with non-empty receive queues:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ netstat -ep4ln --udp|grep 53 |egrep -v &quot;^udp *0&quot;\nudp   524293  0 173.245.1.1:53  0.0.0.0:*   0\nudp   524288  0 173.245.2.3:53  0.0.0.0:*   0</pre></code>\n            <p>In this case two IP addresses received heavy UDP traffic. It was more than the DNS server could handle, the receive queues built up and eventually overflowed. Fortunately, because we are binding to specific IP addresses, overflowing some UDP receive queues won&#39;t affect any other IP addresses.</p><p>Binding to specific IP addresses is critical to keep our DNS infrastructure online. With this setup even if other mitigation techniques fail and the DNS server is left exposed to the packet flood, we are certain the attack will not affect handling DNS on other IP addresses.</p><p>But what does that have to do with the <code>LHTABLE</code>? Well, in our setup we bound to specific IP addresses for both UDP <i>and</i> TCP. While having 16k listening <a href=\"http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/ipv4/udp.c?v=3.18#L476\">sockets in UDP is okay</a>, it turns out it is not fine for TCP.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"what-happened\">What happened</h2>\n            <a href=\"#what-happened\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Due to our DNS setup we had 16k TCP sockets bound to different IP addresses on port 53. Since the port number is fixed, all these sockets ended in exactly one <code>LHTABLE</code> bucket. This particular bucket was number 21 (53 % 32 = 21). When an RST or SYN packet hit it, the <code>__inet_lookup_listener</code> call had to traverse all 16k socket entries. This wasn&#39;t fast, in fact it took 2ms to finish.</p><p>To solve the problem we deployed two changes:</p><ul><li><p>For TCP connections our DNS server now binds to ANY_IP address (aka: 0.0.0.0:53, *:53). We call this &quot;bind to star&quot;. While binding to specific IP addresses is still necessary for UDP, there is little benefit in doing that for the TCP traffic. For TCP we can bind to star safely, without compromising our DDoS defenses.</p></li><li><p>We increased the <code>LHTABLE</code> size in our kernels.
