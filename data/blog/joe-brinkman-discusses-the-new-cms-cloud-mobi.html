	<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/jbrinkman" target="_blank">Joe</a> is a co-founder and technical fellow at <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a>. He is an avid technologist with a broad spectrum of experience in a variety of development languages and technologies.</p>
	<p>DotNetNuke is the leading Web Content Management Platform (or CMS) for Microsoft, powering over 700,000 production web sites worldwide. The flexible DNN open source CMS platform also functions as a web application development framework.</p>
	<p>DNN just recently launched a new social platform. We caught up with Joe to hear the latest on DNN and their social offering.</p>
	<p>"We just launched DotNetNuke 6.2, which is what we're calling the social CMS for business," said Joe. "We include a lot of the same types of functionality that you might find in a Jive or a Yammer or a Chatter, integrated directly into the core CMS platform."</p>
	<p>"It's more than just social," said Joe. "It's social CMS."</p>
	<p>DNN has seen a very strong uptake in the new social offering from their customers.</p>
	<p>They have also seen a strong growth around cloud, mobile and social, the "new CMS." DNN has invested a lot of time and energy into these three verticals and are looking forward to growing the company in those areas.</p>
	<p>"Those three together position us pretty uniquely in the CMS space," said Joe.</p>
	<p>Listen in to hear more on DNN and the new CMS.</p>
