Yet, we hear from customers in Europe, India, Australia, Japan, and many other regions that, as part of their privacy programs, they need solutions to localize data in order to meet their regulatory obligations.</p><p>So as we think about Data Privacy Day, which is coming up on January 28, we are in the interesting position of disagreeing with those who believe that data localization is a proxy for better data privacy, but of also wanting to support our customers who have to comply with certain regulations.</p><p>For this reason, we <a href=\"/introducing-the-cloudflare-data-localization-suite/\">introduced our Data Localization Suite</a> (DLS) in 2020 to help customers navigate a data protection landscape that focuses more and more on data localization. With the DLS, customers can use Cloudflare’s powerful global network and security measures to protect their businesses, while keeping the data we process on their behalf local. Since its launch, we’ve had many customers adopt the Data Localization Suite. In this blog post we want to share updates about how we’re making the DLS more comprehensive and easier to use.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-confusing-state-of-data-protection-regulations\">The confusing state of data protection regulations</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-confusing-state-of-data-protection-regulations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We frequently field questions from customers who hear about new local laws or interpretations of existing regulations that seem to limit what they can do with data. This is especially confusing for customers doing business on the global Internet because they have to navigate regulations that suggest customers based in one country can’t use products from companies based in another country, unless extensive measures are put in place.</p><p>We don’t think this is any way to regulate the Internet. As we’ll talk more about in our blog post tomorrow about cross-border data transfers, we’re encouraged to see new developments aimed at establishing a common set of data protections across jurisdictions to make these data transfers more seamless.</p><p>In the meantime, we have the Data Localization suite to help our customers navigate these challenges.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"a-recap-of-how-the-data-localization-suite-works\">A recap of how the Data Localization Suite works</h3>\n      <a href=\"#a-recap-of-how-the-data-localization-suite-works\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We developed DLS to address three primary customer concerns:</p><ol><li><p>How do I ensure my encryption keys stay in my jurisdiction?</p></li><li><p>How can I ensure that application services like caching and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">WAF</a> only run in my jurisdiction?</p></li><li><p>How can I ensure that logs and metadata are never transferred outside my jurisdiction?</p></li></ol><p>To address these concerns, our DLS has an encryption key component, a component that addresses where content in transit is terminated and inspected, and a component that keeps metadata within a customers’ jurisdiction:</p><p><b>1. Encryption Keys</b>Cloudflare has long offered <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/keyless-ssl/\">Keyless SSL</a> and <a href=\"/introducing-cloudflare-geo-key-manager/\">Geo Key Manager</a>, which ensure that private SSL/TLS key material never leaves the EU. Customers using our Geo Key Manager can choose for encryption keys to be stored only in data centers in the region the customer specifies. Keyless SSL ensures that Cloudflare never has possession of the private key material at all; Geo Key Manager ensures that keys are protected with cryptographic access control, so they can only be used in specified regions.</p><p><b>2. </b><a href=\"/introducing-regional-services/\"><b>Regional Services</b></a>:Regional Services ensures that Cloudflare will only be able to decrypt and inspect the content of HTTPS traffic inside a customer’s chosen region. When Regional Services is enabled, regardless of which data center traffic first hits on our global network, rather than decrypting it at the first data center, we forward the TCP stream in encrypted form. Once it reaches a data center inside the customer’s chosen region, we decrypt and apply our Layer 7 security measures to prevent malicious traffic from reaching our customers’ websites.</p><p><b>3. </b><a href=\"/introducing-the-customer-metadata-boundary/\"><b>Customer Metadata Boundary</b></a>:With this option enabled, no end user traffic logs (which contain IP addresses) that Cloudflare processes on behalf of our customers will leave the region chosen by the customer.
