At the onset of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Ukraine introduced a moratorium on evictions and termination of utility services for unpaid debt. The moratorium ended in January 2024, resulting in significant debt liability and increased financial stress for Ukrainian citizens. The FlyingYeti campaign capitalized on anxiety over the potential loss of access to housing and utilities by enticing targets to open malicious files via debt-themed lures. If opened, the files would result in infection with the PowerShell malware known as <a href=\"https://cert.gov.ua/article/6277849?ref=news.risky.biz\">COOKBOX</a>, allowing FlyingYeti to support follow-on objectives, such as installation of additional payloads and control over the victim’s system.</p><p>Since April 26, 2024, Cloudforce One has taken measures to prevent FlyingYeti from launching their phishing campaign – a campaign involving the use of Cloudflare Workers and GitHub, as well as exploitation of the WinRAR vulnerability <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38831\">CVE-2023-38831</a>. Our countermeasures included internal actions, such as detections and code takedowns, as well as external collaboration with third parties to remove the actor’s cloud-hosted malware. Our effectiveness against this actor prolonged their operational timeline from days to weeks. For example, in a single instance, FlyingYeti spent almost eight hours debugging their code as a result of our mitigations. By employing proactive defense measures, we successfully stopped this determined threat actor from achieving their objectives.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h3>\n            <a href=\"#executive-summary\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <ul><li><p>On April 18, 2024, Cloudforce One detected the Russia-aligned threat actor FlyingYeti preparing to launch a phishing espionage campaign targeting individuals in Ukraine.</p></li><li><p>We discovered the actor used similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as those detailed in <a href=\"https://cert.gov.ua/article/6278620\">Ukranian CERT&#39;s article on UAC-0149</a>, a threat group that has primarily <a href=\"https://cert.gov.ua/article/6277849?ref=news.risky.biz\">targeted Ukrainian defense entities with COOKBOX malware since at least the fall of 2023</a>.</p></li><li><p>From mid-April to mid-May, we observed FlyingYeti conduct reconnaissance activity, create lure content for use in their phishing campaign, and develop various iterations of their malware.

Each action was taken to increase the actor’s cost of continuing their operations. When assessing which action to take and why, we carefully weighed the pros and cons in order to provide an effective active defense strategy against this actor. Our general goal was to increase the amount of time the threat actor spent trying to develop and weaponize their campaign.</p><p>We were able to successfully extend the timeline of the threat actor’s operations from hours to weeks. At each interdiction point, we assessed the impact of our mitigation to ensure the actor would spend more time attempting to launch their campaign. Our mitigation measures disrupted the actor’s activity, in one instance resulting in eight additional hours spent on debugging code.</p><p>Due to our proactive defense efforts, FlyingYeti operators adapted their tactics multiple times in their attempts to launch the campaign. The actor originally intended to have the Cloudflare Worker fetch the malicious RAR file from GitHub. After Cloudforce One interdiction of the Worker, the actor attempted to create additional Workers via a new account. In response, we disabled all Workers, leading the actor to load the RAR file directly from GitHub. Cloudforce One notified GitHub, resulting in the takedown of the RAR file, the GitHub project, and suspension of the account used to host the RAR file. In return, FlyingYeti began testing the option to host the RAR file on the file sharing sites <a href=\"https://pixeldrain.com/\">pixeldrain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.filemail.com/\">Filemail</a>, where we observed the actor alternating the link on the Komunalka phishing site between the following:</p><ul><li><p>hxxps://pixeldrain[.]com/api/file/ZAJxwFFX?download=one</p></li><li><p>hxxps://1014.filemail[.]com/api/file/get?filekey=e_8S1HEnM5Rzhy_jpN6nL-GF4UAP533VrXzgXjxH1GzbVQZvmpFzrFA&amp;pk_vid=a3d82455433c8ad11715865826cf18f6</p></li></ul><p>We notified GitHub of the actor’s evolving tactics, and in response GitHub removed the Komunalka phishing site. After analyzing the files hosted on pixeldrain and Filemail, we determined the actor uploaded dummy payloads, likely to monitor access to their phishing infrastructure (FileMail logs IP addresses, and both file hosting sites provide view and download counts). At the time of publication, we did not observe FlyingYeti upload the malicious RAR file to either file hosting site, nor did we identify the use of alternative phishing or malware delivery methods.</p><p>A timeline of FlyingYeti’s activity and our corresponding mitigations can be found below.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3

to ensure that email services are protected against phishing, BEC and other threats</p></li><li><p>Leverage browser isolation to separate messaging applications like LinkedIn, email, and Signal from your main network</p></li><li><p>Scan, monitor and/or enforce controls on specific or sensitive data moving through your network environment with data loss prevention policies</p></li><li><p>Ensure your systems have the latest WinRAR and Microsoft security updates installed</p></li><li><p>Consider preventing WinRAR files from entering your environment, both at your Cloud Email Security solution and your Internet Traffic Gateway</p></li><li><p>Run an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool such as CrowdStrike or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to get visibility into binary execution on hosts</p></li><li><p>Search your environment for the FlyingYeti indicators of compromise (IOCs) shown below to identify potential actor activity within your network.</p></li></ul><p>If you’re looking
