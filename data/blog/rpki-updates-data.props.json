It has since been updated to account for this shortcoming with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure\">Resource Public Key Infrastructure</a> (RPKI) framework, but can we declare it to be safe yet?</p><p>If the question needs asking, you might suspect we can&#39;t. There is a shortage of reliable data on how much of the Internet is protected from preventable routing problems. Today, we’re releasing a new method to measure exactly that: what percentage of Internet users are protected by their Internet Service Provider from these issues.

To achieve global reachability, ASes interconnect with each other and determine the feasible paths to a given destination IP address by exchanging routing information using BGP. BGP enables routers with only local network visibility to construct end-to-end paths based on the arbitrary preferences of each administrative entity that operates that equipment. Typically, Internet traffic between a user and a destination traverses multiple AS networks using paths constructed by BGP routers.</p><p>BGP, however, lacks built-in security mechanisms to protect the integrity of the exchanged routing information and to provide authentication and authorization of the advertised IP address space. Because of this, AS operators must implicitly trust that the routing information exchanged through BGP is accurate. As a result, the Internet is vulnerable to the injection of bogus routing information, which cannot be mitigated by security measures at the client or server level of the network.</p><p>An adversary with access to a BGP router can inject fraudulent routes into the routing system, which can be used to execute an array of attacks, including:</p><ul><li><p>Denial-of-Service (DoS) through traffic blackholing or redirection,</p></li><li><p>Impersonation attacks to eavesdrop on communications,</p></li><li><p>Machine-in-the-Middle exploits to modify the exchanged data, and subvert reputation-based filtering systems.</p></li></ul><p>Additionally, local misconfigurations and fat-finger errors can be propagated well beyond the source of the error and cause major disruption across the Internet.</p><p>Such an incident happened on <a href=\"/how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-today/\">June 24, 2019</a>. Millions of users were unable to access Cloudflare address space when a regional ISP in Pennsylvania accidentally advertised routes to Cloudflare through their capacity-limited network. This was effectively the Internet equivalent of routing an entire freeway through a neighborhood street.</p><p>Traffic misdirections like these, either unintentional or intentional, are not uncommon. The Internet Society’s <a href=\"https://www.manrs.org/\">MANRS</a> (Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security) initiative estimated that in 2020 alone there were <a href=\"https://www.manrs.org/2021/03/a-regional-look-into-bgp-incidents-in-2020/\">over 3,000 route leaks and hijacks</a>, and new occurrences can be <a href=\"/route-leak-detection-with-cloudflare-radar/\">observed every day through Cloudflare Radar.</a></p><p>The most prominent proposals to secure BGP routing, standardized by the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/\">IETF</a> focus on validating the origin of the advertised routes using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure\">Resource Public Key Infrastructure</a> (RPKI) and verifying the integrity of the paths with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGPsec\">BGPsec</a>. Specifically, RPKI (defined in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7115.html\">RFC 7115</a>) relies on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure\">Public Key Infrastructure</a> to validate that an AS advertising a route to a destination (an IP address space) is the legitimate owner of those IP addresses.</p><p>RPKI has been defined for a long time but lacks adoption. It requires network operators to cryptographically sign their prefixes, and routing networks to perform an RPKI Route Origin Validation (ROV) on their routers. This is a two-step operation that requires coordination and participation from many actors to be effective.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-two-phases-of-rpki-adoption-signing-origins-and-validating-origins\">The two phases of RPKI adoption: signing origins and validating origins</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-two-phases-of-rpki-adoption-signing-origins-and-validating-origins\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>RPKI has two phases of deployment: first, an AS that wants to protect its own IP prefixes can cryptographically sign Route Origin Authorization (ROA) records thereby attesting to be the legitimate origin of that signed IP space. Second, an AS can avoid selecting invalid routes by performing Route Origin Validation (ROV, defined in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6483\">RFC 6483</a>).</p><p>With ROV, a BGP route received by a neighbor is validated against the available RPKI records. A route that is valid or missing from RPKI is selected, while a route with RPKI records found to be invalid is typically rejected, thus preventing the use and propagation of hijacked and misconfigured routes.</p><p>One issue with RPKI is the fact that implementing ROA is meaningful only if other ASes implement ROV, and vice versa. Therefore, securing BGP routing requires a united effort and a lack of broader adoption disincentivizes ASes from commiting the resources to validate their own routes. Conversely, increasing RPKI adoption can lead to network effects and accelerate RPKI deployment. Projects like MANRS and Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://isbgpsafeyet.com/\">isbgpsafeyet.com</a> are promoting good Internet citizenship among network operators, and make the benefits of RPKI deployment known to the Internet. You can check whether your own ISP is being a good Internet citizen by testing it on <a href=\"https://isbgpsafeyet.com/\">isbgpsafeyet.com</a>.</p><p>Measuring the extent to which both ROA (signing of addresses by the network that controls them) and ROV (filtering of invalid routes by ISPs) have been implemented is important to evaluating the impact of these initiatives, developing situational awareness, and predicting the impact of future misconfigurations or attacks.</p><p>Measuring ROAs is straightforward since ROA data is <a href=\"https://ftp.ripe.net/rpki/\">readily available</a> from RPKI repositories. Querying RPKI repositories for publicly routed IP prefixes (e.g. prefixes visible in the <a href=\"http://www.routeviews.org/\">RouteViews</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ripe.net/analyse/internet-measurements/routing-information-service-ris\">RIPE RIS</a> routing tables) allows us to estimate the percentage of addresses covered by ROA objects. Currently, there are 393,344 IPv4 and 86,306 IPv6 ROAs in the global RPKI system, covering about 40% of the globally routed prefix-AS origin pairs<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Measuring ROV, however, is significantly more challenging given it is configured inside the BGP routers of each AS, not accessible by anyone other than each router’s administrator.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"measuring-rov-deployment\">Measuring ROV deployment</h3>\n            <a href=\"#measuring-rov-deployment\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Although we do not have direct access to the configuration of everyone’s BGP routers, it is possible to infer the use of ROV by comparing the reachability of RPKI-valid and RPKI-invalid prefixes from measurement points within an AS<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Consider the following toy topology as an example, where an RPKI-invalid origin is advertised through AS0 to AS1 and AS2.

One way to mitigate this limitation is to announce the RPKI-invalid origin from multiple locations from an anycast network taking advantage of its direct interconnections to the measurement vantage points as shown in the figure below. As a result, an AS that does not itself deploy ROV is less likely to observe the benefits of upstream ASes using ROV, and we would be able to accurately infer ROV deployment per AS<sup>3</sup>.</p><p><i>Note that it’s also important that the IP address of the RPKI-invalid origin should not be covered by a less specific prefix for which there is a valid or unknown RPKI route, otherwise even if an AS filters invalid RPKI routes its users would still be able to find a route to that IP.</i></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7HDnUbqxvRQ3DbhArqJsMg/a21bfe1ef026a4aa615ac21f759d3f3f/2-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1274\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The measurement technique described here is the one implemented by Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://isbgpsafeyet.com\">isbgpsafeyet.com</a> website, allowing end users to assess whether or not their ISPs have deployed BGP ROV.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://isbgpsafeyet.com/\">isbgpsafeyet.com</a> website itself doesn&#39;t submit any data back to Cloudflare, but recently we started measuring whether end users’ browsers can successfully connect to invalid RPKI origins when ROV is present.

Countries with stronger reds have relatively few ASes deploying ROV with high impact, while countries with stronger blues have more ASes deploying ROV but with lower impact per AS.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6m2lvwtrbDEzDObM6NfW5W/2371a8bdb5f7ed5ed4981103d4aad4c5/6-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1295\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, or the United States, adoption appears mostly driven by their larger ASes, while in Greece or Yemen it’s the smaller ones that are adopting ROV.</p><p>The following histogram summarizes the worldwide level of adoption for the 6,765 ASes covered by the previous two maps.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5zg7hScwuknrlGP0z76zvx/6fa811c1f9f92f50397ec64267b0af73/7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"723\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Most ASes either don’t validate at all, or have close to 100% adoption, which is what we’d intuitively expect. However, it&#39;s interesting to observe that there are small numbers of ASes all across the scale. ASes that exhibit partial RPKI-invalid drop rate compared to total requests may either implement ROV partially (on some, but not all, of their BGP routers), or appear as dropping RPKI invalids due to ROV deployment by other ASes in their upstream path.</p><p>To estimate the number of users protected by ROV we only considered ASes with an observed adoption above <b>95%</b>, as an AS with an incomplete deployment still leaves its users vulnerable to route leaks from its BGP peers.</p><p>If we take the previous histogram and summarize by the number of users behind each AS, the green bar on the right corresponds to the <b>261 million</b> users currently protected by ROV according to the above criteria (686 ASes).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/NAtYPcWbDWsiBiMfX56es/40a59d3253b0cba83c6e1bde2bbf83a6/8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"723\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Looking back at the country adoption map one would perhaps expect the number of protected users to be larger. But worldwide ROV deployment is still mostly partial, lacking larger ASes, or both. This becomes even more clear when compared with the next map, plotting just the fraction of fully protected users.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7kAM05eOwaPusgkvSIASoB/e86386a84c161919b3bdc9018145eb1c/9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1369\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>To wrap up our analysis, we look at two world economies chosen for their contrasting, almost symmetrical, stages of deployment: the United States and the European Union.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3DShkKyva4l7rm5qC7gQnP/2ba1802f7d305815450bc1b9df372abb/10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"719\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4Q0ipIYrllZ63MXSRYEh59/bc25c31c0de0b71c157f909e5eb8522f/11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"723\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>112 million Internet users are protected by 111 ASes from the United States with comprehensive ROV deployments.

Also, paths between end user ASes and Cloudflare are often very short (a nice outcome of our extensive peering) and don&#39;t traverse upper-tier networks that they would otherwise use to reach the rest of the Internet.</p><p>In other words, the methodology used focuses on ROV adoption by <b>end user networks</b> (e.g. ISPs) and isn’t meant to reflect the eventual effect of indirect validation from (perhaps validating) upper-tier transit networks. While indirect validation may limit the &quot;blast radius&quot; of (malicious or accidental) route leaks, it still leaves non-validating ASes vulnerable to leaks coming from their peers.</p><p>As with indirect validation, an AS remains vulnerable until its ROV deployment reaches a sufficient level of completion.
