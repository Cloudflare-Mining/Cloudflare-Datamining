	<p>To conclude <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/impact-week">Impact Week</a>, which has been filled with announcements about new initiatives and features that we are thrilled about, today we are publishing our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/impact-report-2022">2022 Impact Report</a>.</p>
	<p>In short, the Impact Report is an annual summary highlighting how we are helping build a better Internet and the progress we are making on our environmental, social, and governance priorities. It is where we showcase successes from Cloudflare Impact programs, celebrate awards and recognitions, and explain our approach to fundamental values like transparency and privacy.</p>
	<p>We believe that a better Internet is principled, for everyone, and sustainable; these are the three themes around which we constructed the report. The Impact Report also serves as our repository for disclosures consistent with our commitments for the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and UN Global Compact (UNGC).</p>
