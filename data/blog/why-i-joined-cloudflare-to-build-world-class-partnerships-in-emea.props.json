That mission is more critical than ever as organizations worldwide navigate an increasingly complex digital landscape, rife with cyber threats, regulatory challenges, and the need for scalable, cost-effective solutions.</p><p>In EMEA, that mission has special significance. The region is a patchwork of diverse markets, industries, and regulatory environments. It demands a partner-centric approach, one that empowers businesses of all sizes to harness Cloudflare’s comprehensive connectivity cloud platform to protect, connect, and accelerate their operations.

I’ve led strategic alliances, built global partner ecosystems, and driven channel transformation across multiple organizations. But what I see at Cloudflare is different. It’s about empowering partners to drive innovation and solve customer challenges, with Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/connectivity-cloud/\"><u>connectivity cloud</u></a> platform and our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network\"><u>network</u></a> being one of the largest and most interconnected in the world, we’re committed to creating long-term value together.</p><p>When you listen, you can hear it, a low murmur, a distant echo of something big emerging. It starts quietly, almost imperceptibly, as forward-thinking companies and partners take notice. Then, momentum builds. More voices join in, more hands reach out. And before you know it, what was once a whisper becomes a roar. That’s what drew me to Cloudflare.</p><p>Cloudflare is not just evolving its partner program, it is investing in a partner-first strategy that will define its next phase of growth as a company. Cloudflare’s commitment to partners is clear and in EMEA we’re specifically prioritizing:</p><ul><li><p>Accelerating partner-led revenue, aiming for more than 90% of total EMEA revenue through partnerships.</p></li><li><p>Expanding market penetration, helping partners unlock large enterprise accounts and new verticals.</p></li><li><p>Supporting partners to build service practices, helping partners build the skills they need to excite their customers and deliver unmatched value with Cloudflare’s connectivity cloud.</p></li><li><p>Partnering in the best way possible, ensuring that partners are equipped, enabled, and incentivized to succeed, and that we have aligned to the right stakeholders, systems, and processes to support that experience.</p></li></ul>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"the-opportunity-to-build-a-world-class-team\">The opportunity to build a world-class team</h2>\n            <a href=\"#the-opportunity-to-build-a-world-class-team\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Great companies are built by great teams.
