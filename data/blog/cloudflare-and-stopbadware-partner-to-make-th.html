	<p>CloudFlare and StopBadware go way back. Even before CloudFlare was founded, our founders had been working with the StopBadware team to help make the Web a safer, better place for everyone. When CloudFlare introduced its <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/127760418">phishing protection</a> this summer, StopBadware was a great sounding board as we developed our remediation and notification process.</p>
	<p>Today, we are excited to announce we have partnered with StopBadware to formalize this cooperation. StopBadware makes the Web safer through the prevention, mitigation, and remediation of <a href="http://www.stopbadware.org/home/badware#websites">badware websites</a>. Their work protects people and organizations from becoming victims of viruses, spyware, scareware, and <a href="http://www.stopbadware.org/home/badware">other badware</a>.</p>
	<p>As a StopBadware partner, CloudFlare will participate in forums, events and educational programs to help further protect websites all over the world. CloudFlare is providing its Business-level service, with extended performance and security, to <a href="http://stopbadware.org">stopbadware.org</a>and<a href="http://badwarebusters.org">badwarebusters.org</a>. We look forward to working with StopBadware and other partners in making the Web a better place!</p>
