That&#39;s because, unlike volumetric L3/4 attacks, HTTP-based attacks eat up resources by making actual HTTP requests to the attacked server.</p><p>Recently we were hit by a couple of unusually large L7 attacks, crossing 1 million HTTP requests per second (1 Mrps). Here is one of them:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/exwpXKLnNtB2ARIM1jHup/106962ce956068514925b5d028d74cfa/https.005.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1024\" height=\"478\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This attack continued for 15 minutes. Multiple recent attacks had &gt;1 Mrps and lasted for minutes.</p><p>This particular attack peaked at 1.75 Mrps. It was composed of short HTTP requests (around 121 bytes per request), without anything unusual in the HTTP headers. The requests had a fixed <code>Cookie</code> header. We counted 52,467 unique IP addresses taking part in this attack.</p><p>Due to the Anycast nature of the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">Cloudflare network</a>, the malicious traffic was spread across multiple Cloudflare cities and with 100 cities we are able to get a good picture of where the bots are located.</p><p>Here are the top affected datacenters:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/meG8LUUO15USZ3tdFdb7X/a2e5aa96265611103b0d21b7242a85ff/https.004.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1024\" height=\"486\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This attack went largely to our Hong Kong and Prague datacenters. This is another common characteristic; most of the recent attacks looked similar.</p><p>Since the attack looks concentrated, we wondered if only a small number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)\">AS</a> numbers (networks) were the source of the attack. Unfortunately no, the IP addresses participating in the flood are evenly distributed. Out of 10,000 random requests we analyzed, we saw source IP addresses from over 300 AS numbers. These are the biggest sources:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">   48 AS24086 ; Vietnam\n  101 AS4134  ; China\n  128 AS7552  ; Vietnam\n  329 AS45899 ; Vietnam \n 2366 AS15895 ; Ukraine</pre></code>\n            <p>These attacks are a new trend, so it&#39;s not fair to blame the AS operators for not cleaning up devices participating in them. Having said that, the Ukrainian ISP and Vietnamese AS45899 seem to stand out. We&#39;ll get back to those in a moment.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"bandwidth\">Bandwidth</h3>\n      <a href=\"#bandwidth\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Although requests per second is a common metric for measuring these attacks, it&#39;s not the only one. We can also measure the bandwidth used in the attack.</p><p>By this count the attack mentioned above was pretty small (since we&#39;ve got used to DDoS attacks being reported in 100s of Gbps). It peaked at roughly 2Gbps. But recall that these L7 attacks end up hitting a web server and are not simply volumetric: they use server resources.</p><p>However, we saw another attack that was unusual in that it was an L7 with similar bandwidth consumption to traditional L3/4 volumetric attacks. First, here&#39;s the requests per second graph:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5g2Rhgyi6l1ZlWw6Y6sIGa/0e30549ea13ed98927afc33ca3dca5b7/https.003.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1023\" height=\"471\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This attack generated &quot;only&quot; 220k requests per second at peak. However, it generated significant inbound bandwidth:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5w0BaTPZVLyDn3fXFOlkfZ/e37dcc868c297b181227586de0717160/x.001-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1024\" height=\"468\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This attack topped out at 360Gbps per second of inbound HTTP traffic. It&#39;s pretty unusual for an HTTP attack to generate a substantial amount of network traffic. This attack was special, and was composed of HTTP requests like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">GET /en HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: &lt;some string&gt;\nCookie: &lt;some cookie&gt;\nHost: example.com\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 800000\n\na[]=&amp;b[]=&amp;a[]=&amp;b[]=&amp;a[]=&amp;b[]=&amp;a[]=&amp;b[]=&amp;a[]=&amp;b[]=&amp;a[]=&amp;b[]=...</pre></code>\n            <p>It&#39;s the long payload sent after the request headers that allowed the attackers to generate substantial traffic. Since this attack we&#39;ve seen similar events with varying parameters in the request body. Sometimes these attacks came as GET requests, sometimes as POST.</p><p>Additionally, this particular attack lasted roughly one hour, with 128,833 unique IP addresses. The datacenter distribution was different, with most of the attack concentrated on Frankfurt:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/Hs6Je7g3YpJ1BygPIFbpf/1ce275a4343a05aef89b4f6a383a7f71/https.002.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1023\" height=\"466\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As the attack was composed of a very large number of bots, we expected the AS distribution to be fairly even. Indeed, in the 10,000 request sample we recorded a whopping 737 unique AS numbers. Here are the top sources:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">  286 AS45899 ; Vietnam\n  314 AS7552  ; Vietnam\n  316 AS3462  ; Taiwan\n  323 AS18403 ; Vietnam\n 1510 AS15895 ; Ukraine</pre></code>\n            <p>Once again, the Ukrainian ISP and couple of Vietnamese networks are the top hitters.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"more-on-the-sources\">More on the sources</h3>\n      <a href=\"#more-on-the-sources\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We wondered why AS15895 was so special.
