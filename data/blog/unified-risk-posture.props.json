Today, one unified platform enables organizations to:</p><ul><li><p><b>Evaluate risk across people and applications:</b> Cloudflare evaluates risk posed by people via <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-ueba/\">user entity and behavior analytics (UEBA)</a> models and risks to apps, APIs, and sites via malicious payload, zero-day threat, and bot detection models.</p></li><li><p><b>Exchange risk indicators with best-in-class partners:</b> Cloudflare ingests risk scores from best-in-class <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/endpoint-security/\">endpoint protection (EPP)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-an-identity-provider/\">identity provider (IDP)</a> partners and shares telemetry back with <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-siem/\">security information and event management (SIEM)</a> and extended detection and response (XDR) platforms for further analysis, all via one-time integrations with our unified API.</p></li><li><p><b>Enforce automated risk controls at scale:</b> Based on these dynamic first- and third-party risk scores, Cloudflare enforces consistent risk controls for people and apps across any location around the world.</p></li></ul><p><b>Figure 1: Unified Risk Posture Diagram</b></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3WLbotRM1RL1VFQwZbNZ8y/82a2c3b6e40096ac515672aa8bbd20b8/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1128\" height=\"547\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As mentioned above, this suite converges capabilities from our SASE and WAAP security portfolios onto our global network. Customers can now take advantage of built-in risk management functionality packaged as part of these existing portfolios.</p><p>This launch builds on our progressive efforts to extend first-party visibility and controls and third-party integrations that make it easier for organizations to adapt to evolving risks. For example, as part of the 2024 <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/security-week/\">Security Week</a>, we announced the general availability of <a href=\"/cf1-user-risk-score\">behavior-based user risk scoring</a> and the beta availability of an <a href=\"/security-analytics-ai-assistant\">AI-enabled assistant</a> to help you analyze risks facing your applications. And in a <a href=\"/cloudflare-email-security-now-works-with-crowdstrike-falcon-logscale\">recent integration in the Fall of 2023</a>, we announced that our cloud email security customers can ingest and display our threat detections within the CrowdStrike Falcon® Next-Gen SIEM dashboard.</p><p>To further manage your risk posture, you will be able to take advantage of new Cloudflare capabilities and integrations, including:</p><ul><li><p>A new integration to share Cloudflare Zero Trust and email log data with the CrowdStrike Falcon Next-Gen SIEM <i>(available now)</i></p></li><li><p>A new integration to share Cloudflare’s user risk score with Okta to enforce access policies <i>(coming by the end of Q2 2024)</i></p></li><li><p>New first-party UEBA models, including user risk scores based on device posture checks <i>(coming by the end of Q2 2024)</i></p></li></ul><p>Unifying the evaluation, exchange, and enforcement stages of risk management onto Cloudflare’s platform helps security leaders mitigate risk with less effort. As a cybersecurity vendor defending both public-facing and internal infrastructure, Cloudflare is uniquely positioned to protect wide swathes of your expanding attack surface. Bringing together dynamic first-party risk scoring, flexible integrations, and automated enforcement helps drive two primary business outcomes:</p><ol><li><p><b>Reducing effort in SecOps</b> with less manual policy building and greater agility in responding to incidents. This means fewer clicks to build policies, more automated workflows, and lower mean times to detect (MTTD) and mean times to respond (MTTR) to incidents.</p></li><li><p><b>Reducing cyber risk</b> with visibility and controls that span people and apps. This means fewer critical incidents and more threats blocked automatically.</p></li></ol><p>Customers like <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/about\">Indeed</a>, the #1 job site in the world, are already seeing these impacts by partnering with Cloudflare:</p><blockquote><p><i>“Cloudflare is helping us mitigate risk more effectively with less effort and simplifies how we deliver Zero Trust across my organization.”</i>— <b>Anthony Moisant</b>, SVP, Chief Information Officer and Chief Security Officer at <b>Indeed</b>.</p></blockquote>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"problem-too-many-risks-across-too-much-attack-surface\">Problem: Too many risks across too much attack surface</h2>\n            <a href=\"#problem-too-many-risks-across-too-much-attack-surface\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Managing risk posture is an inherently broad challenge, covering internal dangers and external threats across attack vectors. Below is just a sampling of risk factors CISOs and their security teams track across three everyday dimensions including people, apps, and data:</p><ul><li><p><b>People risks:</b> Phishing, social engineering, malware, ransomware, remote access, insider threats, physical access compromise, third party / supply chain, mobile devices / BYOD</p></li><li><p><b>App risks:</b> denial of service, zero-day exploits, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, remote code execution, credential stuffing, account takeover, shadow IT usage, API abuse</p></li><li><p><b>Data risks:</b> data loss / exposure, data theft / breach, privacy violation, compliance violation, data tampering</p></li></ul><p>Point solutions emerged to lock down some of these specific risks and attack vectors. But over time, organizations have accumulated many services with a limited ability to talk to one another and build a more holistic view of risk. The granular telemetry generated by each tool has led to information overload for security staff who are often stretched thin already. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Extended Detection &amp; Response (XDR) platforms play a critical role in aggregating risk data across environments and mitigating threats based on analysis, but these tools still demand time, resources, and expertise to operate effectively. All these challenges have gotten worse as attack surfaces have expanded rapidly, as businesses embrace hybrid work, build new digital apps, and more recently, experiment with AI.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"how-cloudflare-helps-manage-risk-posture\">How Cloudflare helps manage risk posture</h2>\n            <a href=\"#how-cloudflare-helps-manage-risk-posture\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>To help restore control over this complexity, Cloudflare for Unified Risk Posture provides one platform to evaluate risk, exchange indicators, and enforce dynamic controls throughout IT environments and around the world, all while complementing the security tools your business already relies on.</p><p>Although the specific risks Cloudflare can mitigate are wide-ranging (including all those in the sample bullets above), the following three use cases represent the full range of our capabilities, which you can start taking advantage of today.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"use-case-1-enforce-zero-trust-with-cloudflare-crowdstrike\">Use Case #1: Enforce Zero Trust with Cloudflare & CrowdStrike</h3>\n            <a href=\"#use-case-1-enforce-zero-trust-with-cloudflare-crowdstrike\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>This first use case spotlights the flexibility with which Cloudflare fits into your current security ecosystem to make it easier to adopt <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust best practices</a>.</p><p>Cloudflare integrates with and ingests security signals from best-in-class <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/service-providers/\">EPP</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/\">IDP</a> partners to enforce identity and device posture checks for any access request to any destination.

Plus, with one-time integrations that work across all our services, you can extend controls across your IT environments with agility.</p></li><li><p>The <b>scale of our global network</b>: Every security service is available for customers to run in every location across our network spanning 320+ locations and 13K+ interconnects. In this way, single-pass inspection and risk policy enforcement is always fast, consistent, and resilient, delivered close to your users and apps.</p></li></ul><p>If you’re ready to see how Cloudflare can help you manage risk, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/contact/\">request a consultation today</a>.
