	<p>The Internet is built on a series of shared protocols, all working in harmony to deliver the collective experience that has changed the way we live and work. These open standards have created a platform such that a myriad of companies can build unique services and products that work together seamlessly. As a steward and supporter of an open Internet, we aspire to provide an interoperable platform that works with all the complementary technologies that our customers use across their technology stack. This has been the guiding principle for the multiple partnerships we have launched over the last few years. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>One example is our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance">Bandwidth Alliance</a> — launched in 2018, this alliance with 18 cloud and storage providers aims to reduce <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-are-data-egress-fees">egress fees</a>, also known as data transfer fees, for our customers. The Bandwidth Alliance has broken the norms of the cloud industry so that customers can move data more freely. Since then, we have launched <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners">several technology partner programs</a> with over 40+ partners, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/analytics"><b>Analytics</b></a> — Visualize Cloudflare logs and metrics easily, and help customers better understand events and trends from websites and applications on the Cloudflare network.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect-partnerships"><b>Network Interconnect</b></a> — Partnerships with best-in-class Interconnection platforms offer private, secure, software-defined links with near instant-turn-up of ports.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/endpoint-partners"><b>Endpoint Protection Partnerships</b></a> — With these integrations, every connection to our customer’s corporate application gets an additional layer of identity assurance without the need to connect to VPN.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity"><b>Identity Providers</b></a> — Easily integrate your organization's single sign-on provider and benefit from the ease-of-use and functionality of Cloudflare Access.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	</figure>
	<p>These partner programs have helped us serve our customers better alongside our partners with our complementary solutions. The integrations we have driven have made it easy for <i>thousands of customers</i> to use Cloudflare with other parts of their stack.</p>
	<p>We aim to continue expanding the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/partners">Cloudflare Partner Network</a> to make it seamless for our customers to use Cloudflare. To support our growing ecosystem of partners, we are excited to launch our Technology Partner Program.</p>
