	<p>During Birthday Week 2022, we announced a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-launchpad">$1.25 billion funding program for startups building on our developer platform</a>, Cloudflare Workers. This was done in partnership with 26 leading VC firms who have been investing in or seeking to invest in Workers-based startups.</p>
	<p>Today, we’re excited to reveal the first cohort of Launchpad Startups as well as <b>14 additional VC partners, bringing the Launchpad to $2 billion</b> in potential funding from <b>40</b> VC firms in total.</p>
	<h3>Who are our new VC partners?</h3>
	<p>We are excited to welcome 14 additional firms to the Workers Launchpad, which you can find included in the image below. They have worked with hundreds of companies that have grown to become leaders in their areas including Asana, Canva, Figma, Netlify, Vercel, Area 1 Security (which Cloudflare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2022/cloudflare-to-acquire-area-1-security">acquired</a> in 2022), and many others. Notably, they also represent a diverse group of investors who support startups across North and South America, Europe, and Asia.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>Many of these investors have seen the competitive advantages of building on Workers through their own portfolio companies firsthand and are looking forward to providing the capital and resources you need to build and scale your business.</p>
	<h3>Announcing the Fall 2022 cohort of Launchpad Startups!</h3>
	<p>We received hundreds of applications for the Fall cohort from startups representing more than 30 countries. We were blown away by the breadth of businesses that folks were building - some are creating tools to simplify developer workflows, while others are helping <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce">ecommerce businesses</a> better reach and serve customers around the world. The common thread amongst all the Launchpad companies, however, is their usage of Cloudflare’s developer platform to build more secure, reliable, and feature-rich products faster than they otherwise could.</p>
	<h3>Introducing the Fall 2022 cohort</h3>
