Object storage is well suited to storing everything from media files or log files to application-specific metadata, all retrievable with consistent <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/glossary/what-is-latency/\">latency</a>, high durability, and limitless capacity.</p><p>The most familiar API for Object Storage, and the API R2 implements, is Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3). When S3 launched in 2006, cloud storage services were a godsend for developers. It didn’t happen overnight, but over the last fifteen years, developers have embraced cloud storage and its promise of infinite storage space.</p><p>As transformative as cloud storage has been, a downside emerged: actually getting your data back. Over time, companies have amassed massive amounts of data on cloud provider networks. When they go to retrieve that data, they’re hit with <a href=\"/aws-egregious-egress/\">massive egress fees</a> that don’t correspond to any customer value — just a tax developers have grown accustomed to paying.</p><p>Enter R2.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7ueoC6FVML11Wrrpr2ELlt/38ceacbacb2b5891ad12f2e52ee0b666/unnamed-1.png\" alt=\"Cloudflare R2 means removing ridiculous fees\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Traditional object storage charges developers for three things: bandwidth, storage size and storage operations.</p><p>R2 builds on Cloudflare’s commitment to the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/\">Bandwidth Alliance</a>, providing zero-cost egress for stored objects — no matter your request rate.  Egress bandwidth is often the largest charge for developers utilizing object storage and is also the hardest charge to predict.  Eliminating it is a huge win for open-access to data stored in the cloud.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we are shifting bandwidth costs elsewhere. Cloudflare R2 will be priced at $0.015 per GB of data stored per month — significantly cheaper than major incumbent providers.</p><p>Infrequent access to objects is often trivial for providers to support yet incurs the same per-operation charges. We don’t think it’s fair that typical object storage bills a developer making one request a second the same rate as an enterprise making thousands of requests a second — or frequently a higher rate when considering negotiated volume discounts.</p><p>On the flip side, providers designed for infrequent access typically can’t scale to heavy usage.</p><p>R2 will zero-rate infrequent storage operations under a threshold — currently planned to be in the single digit requests per second range. Above this range, R2 will charge significantly less per-operation than the major providers. Our object storage will be extremely inexpensive for infrequent access and yet capable of and cheaper than major incumbent providers at scale.</p><p>This cheaper price doesn’t come with reduced scalability. Behind the scenes, R2 automatically and intelligently manages the tiering of data to drive both performance at peak load and low-cost for infrequently requested objects.  We’ve gotten rid of complex, manual tiering policies in favor of what developers have always wanted out of object storage: limitless scale at the lowest possible cost.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"r2-means-repositioning-records\">R2 means “Repositioning Records”</h3>\n            <a href=\"#r2-means-repositioning-records\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Zero egress means you can get objects out easily, but what about putting objects in? <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-data-migration/\">Migrating data</a> across cloud providers, even if they both support the complete S3 API, is error-prone and costly.</p><p>To make this easier for you, without requiring you to change any of your tooling, Cloudflare will offer a migration service from <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/solutions/s3-compatible-object-storage/\">S3-compatible cloud storage services</a>.

Starting with a Worker to transform and manipulate the data, R2 can ingest large volumes of sensor data and store it at low cost. With no egress fees, it becomes simple to migrate volumes of data to multiple databases and analytics solutions as needed, dramatically reducing storage costs. With the ability to run a Worker on the outgoing data as well, the data pipeline itself is more flexible.</p><p>R2 is also a great place for CDN assets and large media files. For large files, R2 can significantly extend cache lifetimes while dramatically slashing egress bills. Combined with the Cache API and Workers, content can be dynamically cached for low-latency access around the globe.</p><p>More than anything, R2’s lack of egress bandwidth charges makes it ideal for storing content that’s accessed frequently. Today, R2 scales well to handle heavy request loads, dynamically tiering your objects to provide the best performance at the lowest cost. This dynamic tiering allows us to offer the lowest prices while supporting peak performance — with no user configuration required.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"accessing-cloudflare-r2\">Accessing Cloudflare R2</h3>\n            <a href=\"#accessing-cloudflare-r2\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>R2 is currently under development — you can sign up <a href=\"https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/plans\">here</a> to join the waitlist for access.
