If your group’s focus falls within one of the subject categories below and you’re willing to give us a 30 second shout out and tweet a photo of your group and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cloudflare\">@Cloudflare</a>, your meetup’s pizza expense will be reimbursed.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvJjiS1iuzf_XYNaah20xTwNfjcBQeiqjmrHi9CEFWM/edit?usp=sharing\">Get Your Pizza $ Reimbursed »</a></p><h3>Developer Relations at Cloudflare &amp; why we’re doing this</h3><p>I’m <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fitchaj\">Andrew Fitch</a> and I work on the Developer Relations team at <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare</a>. One of the things I like most about working in DevRel is empowering community members who are already doing great things out in the world. Whether they’re starting conferences, hosting local meetups, or writing educational content, I think it’s important to support them in their efforts and reward them for doing what they do. Community organizers are the glue that holds developers together socially. Let’s support them and make their lives easier by taking care of the pizza part of the equation.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2LFJE5nWDC74sln8mrtauZ/3a6517ac0115d7b9a4915c001c50c393/FingerPhotography-Cloudfare-8733.jpg\" alt=\"Meetup gathering\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"4256\" height=\"2840\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><h4>What’s in it for Cloudflare?</h4><ol><li><p>We want web developers to target the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/\">apps platform</a></p></li><li><p>We want more people to think about <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/\">working at Cloudflare</a></p></li><li><p>Some people only know of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare</a> as a CDN, but it’s actually a security company and does much more than that. General awareness helps tell the story of what Cloudflare is about.</p></li></ol><h4>What kinds of groups we most want to support</h4><p>We want to work with groups that are closely aligned with Cloudflare, groups which focus on web development, web security, devops, or tech ops. We often work with language-specific meetups (such as Go London User Group) or diversity &amp; inclusion meetups (such as Women Who Code Portland). We’d also love to work with college student groups and any other coding groups which are focused on sharing technical knowledge with the community.</p><p>To get sponsored pizza, groups must be focused on...</p><ul><li><p>Web performance &amp; optimization</p></li><li><p>Front-end frameworks</p></li><li><p>Language-specific (JavaScript / PHP / Go / Lua / etc.)</p></li><li><p>Diversity &amp; inclusion meetups for web devs / devops / tech ops</p></li><li><p>Workshops / classes for web devs / devops / tech ops</p></li></ul><h4>How it works</h4><ol><li><p>Interested groups need to read our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvJjiS1iuzf_XYNaah20xTwNfjcBQeiqjmrHi9CEFWM/edit\">Cloudflare Meetup Group Pizza Reimbursement Rules document</a>.</p></li><li><p>If the group falls within the requirements, the group should proceed to schedule their meetup and pull the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1afluXpf2eYeQ7SkmV2ONrojeZwosMTNifhnZR1chNTw/edit?usp=sharing\">Cloudflare Introductory Slides</a> ahead of time.</p></li><li><p>At the event, an organizer should present the Cloudflare Introductory Slides at the beginning, giving us a 30 second shout out, and take a photo of the group in front of the slides.
