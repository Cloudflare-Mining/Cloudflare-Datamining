These samples are collected by examining 1 in every X packets, where X is the sampling rate configured on the router. Typical sampling rates range from 1 in every 1,000 to 1 in every 4,000 packets. The ideal sampling rate depends on the traffic volume, traffic diversity, and the compute / memory power of your router’s hardware. You can read more about the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-network-monitoring/routers/recommended-sampling-rate/\">recommended network flow sampling rate</a> in Cloudflare’s MNM Developer Docs.</p><p>The sampled data is packaged into one of two industry standard formats for network flow data: NetFlow or sFlow. In NetFlow, the sampled packet data is grouped by different packet characteristics such as source / destination IP, port, and protocol. Each group of sampled packet data also includes a traffic volume estimate. In sFlow, the entire packet header is selected as the representative sample, and there isn’t any data summarization. As a result, sFlow is a richer data format and includes more details about network traffic than NetFlow data. Once either the NetFlow or sFlow data samples are collected, they’re sent to Magic Network Monitoring for analysis and alerting.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2XoUWHVTlsaVD6wYjekYm6/951cff39344b3912444f239618af64c6/4-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"why-simple-random-sampling-didnt-work-for-magic-network-monitoring\">Why simple random sampling didn’t work for Magic Network Monitoring</h3>\n      <a href=\"#why-simple-random-sampling-didnt-work-for-magic-network-monitoring\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Magic Network Monitoring has come a long way from its early access release one year ago. In particular, the Cloudflare engineering team invested significant time in improving the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations in MNM. In the early access version of Magic Network Monitoring, customers were unexpectedly reporting that their network traffic volume estimates were too high and didn’t match the expected value.</p><p>Magic Network Monitoring performs its own sampling of the NetFlow or sFlow data it receives, so it can effectively scale and manage the data ingested across Cloudflare’s global network. Increasing the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations was more difficult than expected, as the NetFlow or sFlow data parsed by MNM is already built on sampled packet data. This introduces multiple distinct layers of data sampling in the product’s analytics.</p><p>The first version of Magic Network Monitoring used <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample\">random sampling</a> where a random subset of network flow data with the same timestamp was selected to represent the traffic volume at that point in time. A characteristic of network flow data is that some samples are more significant than others and represent a greater volume of network traffic. In order to account for this significance, we can associate a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting\">weight</a> with each sample based on the traffic volume it represents. Network flow data weights are always positive numbers, and they follow a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail\">long tail distribution</a>. These data characteristics caused MNM’s random sampling to incorrectly estimate the traffic volume of a customer’s network. Customers would see false spikes in their traffic volume analytics when an outlying data sample from the long tail was randomly selected to be the representative of all traffic at that point in time.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2Tje0Xn9GucCoNamBEyvVE/0d097130617a1c6584efa8679f91c87a/5-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"increasing-accuracy-with-varopt-reservoir-sampling\">Increasing accuracy with VarOpt reservoir sampling</h3>\n      <a href=\"#increasing-accuracy-with-varopt-reservoir-sampling\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>To solve this problem, the Cloudflare engineering team implemented an alternative <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling\">reservoir sampling</a> technique called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0473.pdf\">VarOpt</a>. VarOpt is designed to collect samples from a stream of data when the length of the data stream is unknown (a perfect application for analyzing incoming network flow data). In the MNM implementation of VarOpt, we start with an empty reservoir of a fixed size that is filled with samples of network flow data. When the reservoir is full, and there is still new incoming network flow data, an old sample is randomly discarded from the reservoir and replaced with a new one.</p><p>After a certain number of samples have been observed, we calculate the traffic volume across all weighted samples in the reservoir, and that is the estimated traffic volume of a customer’s network flow at that point in time. Finally, the reservoir is emptied, and the VarOpt loop is restarted by filling the reservoir with the next set of the latest network flow samples.</p><p>The new VarOpt sampling method significantly increased the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations in Magic Network Monitoring, and solved our customer’s problems. These sampling improvements paved the way for general availability, and we’re excited to make accurate network flow analytics available to everyone.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2NYGpyTodAgtP9K8KycjGZ/fa5e290cdf3286c7efcbbe53954e1540/6-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"developer-docs-and-discord-community\">Developer Docs and Discord Community</h3>\n      <a href=\"#developer-docs-and-discord-community\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>There are detailed <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-network-monitoring/\">Developer Docs for Magic Network Monitoring</a> that explain the product’s features and outlines a step-by-step configuration guide for new customers.
