Most organizations describe a starting point of private connectivity and “castle and moat” security controls: a corporate <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-wan/\">WAN</a> composed of point-to-point and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mpls/\">MPLS</a> circuits and hardware appliances at the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-the-network-perimeter/\">perimeter of physical networks</a>. This architecture model worked well in a pre-cloud world, but as applications have shifted outside of the walls of the corporate data center and users can increasingly work from anywhere, the concept of the perimeter has crumbled.</p><p>In response to these shifts, traditional networking and security vendors have developed a wide array of point solutions to fill specific gaps: a virtual appliance to filter web traffic, a physical one to optimize bandwidth use across multiple circuits, a cloud-based tool to prevent data loss, and so on. IT teams now need to manage a broader-than-ever set of tools and contend with gaps in security, visibility, and control as a result.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4qve46P1BhXgMXPq3Vl99p/6ad6959ea94207ae8578f6a74f4f1923/image3-7.png\" alt=\"Today’s fragmented corporate network\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Today’s fragmented corporate network</i></p><p>We view this current state, with IT teams contending with a patchwork of tools and a never-ending ticket queue, as a transitional period to a world where the Internet forms the foundation of the corporate network.

This includes traffic routing, load balancing, and failover; application-aware traffic steering and shaping; and automatic configuration and orchestration. These capabilities connect you automatically to the closest Cloudflare location, where traffic is optimized and routed to its destination. This approach allows you to use Cloudflare’s network – presence in 275 cities and 100 countries across the globe, 11,000+ interconnects and a growing fiber backbone – as an extension of your own.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table width=\"100%\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Network function</th>\n    <th>Magic WAN Connector</th>\n    <th>Cloudflare Network</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Branch routing (traffic shaping, failover, QoS)</td>\n    <td>Application-aware routing and traffic steering between multiple last mile Internet circuits</td>\n    <td>Application-aware routing and traffic steering across the middle mile to get traffic to its destination</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Centralized device management</td>\n    <td>Connector config controlled from unified Cloudflare dashboard</td>\n    <td>Cloudflare unified dashboard portal, observability, Zero Trust services</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Zero-touch configuration</td>\n    <td>Automagic config; boots with smart defaults and sets up tunnels + routes</td>\n    <td>Automagic config; Magic WAN Connector pulls down updates from central control plane</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>VPN + Firewall</td>\n    <td>VPN termination + basic network segmentation included</td>\n    <td>Full-featured SASE platform including ZTNA, FWaaS, DDoS, WAAP, and Email Security</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Application-aware path selection</td>\n    <td>Application-aware traffic shaping for last mile</td>\n    <td>Application-aware Enhanced Internet for middle mile</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Application auto discovery</td>\n    <td>Works with Cloudflare network to perform application discovery and classification in real time</td>\n    <td>1+1=3: Cloudflare Zero Trust application classification tools reused in this context</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href='https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/app-performance-monitoring/'>Application performance visibility</a></td>\n    <td>Acts as telemetry source for Cloudflare observability tools</td>\n    <td>Cloudflare One Analytics platform &amp; Digital Experience Monitoring</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Software can be deployed in the cloud</td>\n    <td>Software can be deployed as a public cloud VM</td>\n    <td>All configuration controlled via unified Cloudflare dashboard</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"fully-integrated-security-from-day-0\">Fully integrated security from day 0</h3>\n            <a href=\"#fully-integrated-security-from-day-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The Magic WAN Connector, like all of Cloudflare’s products, was developed from the ground up to natively integrate with the rest of the Cloudflare One portfolio.

Our partners have validated their solutions and tested that their networking hardware can connect to Cloudflare using these standards. To make setup easier for our mutual customers, detailed configuration instructions will be available soon at both the Cloudflare Developer Docs and partner websites.</p><p>If you are a networking solutions provider and are interested in <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners/\">becoming a Network On-Ramp partner</a>, please reach out to us.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"ready-to-start-building-the-future-of-your-corporate-network\">Ready to start building the future of your corporate network?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#ready-to-start-building-the-future-of-your-corporate-network\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>We’re beyond excited to get the Magic WAN Connector into customer hands and help you jumpstart your transition to SASE.
