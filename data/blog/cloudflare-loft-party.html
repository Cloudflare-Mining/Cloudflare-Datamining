	<p>Last week the CloudFlare team opened our new San Francisco office to our users and friends for an open house / loft party. We had The Peelers, a terrific local mashup band, entertain the crowd while everyone sipped drinks and snacked on great food from San Francisco street cart vendors. You can check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/60411012@N07/sets/72157626245199304">photos which we just posted online</a> featuring the whole CloudFlare team and many of our users. Hope to see even more of you next time!</p>
