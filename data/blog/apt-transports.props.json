Access added SaaS-like convenience to the on-premise tools we managed.

However, we still needed to handle how services communicate with our internal APT repository.</p><p>We recently <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/apt-transport-cloudflared\">open sourced a new APT transport</a> which allows customers to protect their private APT repositories using <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-access/\">Cloudflare Access</a>.

Originally released in 1998, APT was to Debian what the App Store was to modern smartphones - a decade ahead of its time!</p><p>APT sits atop the lower-level <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dpkg\">dpkg</a> tool, which is used to install, query, and remove <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)\">.deb packages</a> - the primary software packaging format in <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html\">Debian</a> and related Linux distributions such as Ubuntu. With dpkg, packaging and managing software installed on your system became easier - but it didn’t solve for problems around distribution of packages, such as via the Internet or local media; at the time of inception, it was commonplace to install packages from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM\">CD-ROM</a>.</p><p>APT introduced the concept of repositories - a mechanism for storing and indexing a collection of .deb packages. APT supports connecting to multiple repositories for finding packages and automatically resolving package dependencies. The way APT connects to said repositories is via a “transport” - a mechanism for communicating between the APT client and its repository source (more on this later).</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"apt-over-the-internet\">APT over the Internet</h2>\n            <a href=\"#apt-over-the-internet\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Prior to version 1.5, APT did not include support for HTTPS - if you wanted to install a package over the Internet, your connection was not encrypted. This reduces privacy - an attacker snooping traffic could determine specific package version your system is installing. It also exposes you to on-path attacker attacks where an attacker could, for example, exploit a remote code execution vulnerability. Just 6 months ago, we saw an example of the latter with <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3462\">CVE-2019-3462</a>.</p><p>Enter the APT HTTPS transport - an optional transport you can install to add support for connecting to repositories over HTTPS. Once installed, users need to configure their APT <a href=\"https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/apt/sources.list.5.en.html\">sources.list</a> with repositories using HTTPS.</p><p>The challenge here, of course, is that the most common way to install this transport is via APT and HTTP - a classic bootstrapping problem! An alternative here is to download the .deb package via curl and install it via dpkg. You’ll find the links to apt-transport-https binaries for Stretch <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/stretch/apt-transport-https#pdownload\">here</a> - once you have the URL path for your system architecture, you can download it from the <a href=\"https://deb.debian.org/\">deb.debian.org</a> mirror-redirector over HTTPS, e.g. for amd64 (a.k.a. x86_64):</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">curl -o apt-transport-https.deb -L https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/a/apt/apt-transport-https_1.4.9_amd64.deb \nHASH=c8c4366d1912ff8223615891397a78b44f313b0a2f15a970a82abe48460490cb &amp;&amp; echo &quot;$HASH  apt-transport-https.deb&quot; | sha256sum -c\nsudo dpkg -i apt-transport-https.deb</pre></code>\n            <p>To confirm which APT transports are installed on your system, you can list each “method binary” that is installed:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">ls /usr/lib/apt/methods</pre></code>\n            <p>With apt-transport-https installed you should now see ‘https’ in that list.</p><h4>The state of APT &amp; HTTPS on Debian</h4><p>You may be wondering how relevant this APT HTTPS transport is today.

For example, we’ve been able to iterate on tools for Access like the <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-access-for-atlassian\">Atlassian SSO</a> plugin and the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/access/ssh/\">SSH feature</a>, as collaborative efforts between DevTools and the Access team.</p><p>Our DevTools team wanted to take the same dogfooding approach to protect our internal APT repository with Access.

The second command wraps curl to download the GPG key, and hands it off to `apt-key add`.</p><h4>Cloudflare Access on &quot;headless&quot; servers</h4><p>If you’re looking to deploy APT repositories protected by Cloudflare Access to non-user-facing machines (a.k.a. “headless” servers), opening a browser does not work. The good news is since February, <a href=\"/give-your-automated-services-credentials-with-access-service-tokens/\">Cloudflare Access supports service tokens</a> - and we’ve built support for them into our APT transport from day one.</p><p>If you’d like to use service tokens with our APT transport, it’s as simple as placing the token in a file in the correct path; because the machine already has a token, there is also no dependency on `cloudflared` for authentication. You can find details on how to set-up a service token in the APT transport <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/apt-transport-cloudflared/blob/master/README.md\">README</a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>As demonstrated, you can get started using our APT transport today - we’d love to hear your feedback on this!</p><p>This work came out of an internal dogfooding effort, and we’re currently experimenting with additional packaging formats and tooling.
