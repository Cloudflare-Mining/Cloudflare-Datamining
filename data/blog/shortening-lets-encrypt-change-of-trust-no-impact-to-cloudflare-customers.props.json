One is cross-signed with <a href=\"https://www.identrust.com/\">IdenTrust</a>, a globally trusted CA that has been around since 2000, and the other is Let’s Encrypt’s own root CA, ISRG Root X1. Since Let’s Encrypt launched, <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/#root-certificates\">ISRG Root X1</a> has been steadily gaining its own device compatibility.</p><p>On September 30, 2024, Let’s Encrypt’s certificate chain cross-signed with IdenTrust will <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration.html\">expire</a>. After the cross-sign expires, servers will no longer be able to serve certificates signed by the cross-signed chain. Instead, all Let’s Encrypt certificates will use the ISRG Root X1 CA.</p><p>Most devices and browser versions released after 2016 will not experience any issues as a result of the change since the ISRG Root X1 will already be installed in those clients’ trust stores. That&#39;s because these modern browsers and operating systems were built to be agile and flexible, with upgradeable trust stores that can be updated to include new certificate authorities.</p><p>The change in the certificate chain will impact legacy devices and systems, such as devices running Android version 7.1.1 (released in 2016) or older, as those exclusively rely on the cross-signed chain and lack the ISRG X1 root in their trust store. These clients will encounter TLS errors or warnings when accessing domains secured by a Let’s Encrypt certificate. We took a look at the data ourselves and found that, of all Android requests, 2.96% of them come from devices that will be affected by the change. That’s a substantial portion of traffic that will lose access to the Internet. We’re committed to keeping those users online and will modify our certificate pipeline so that we can continue to serve users on older devices without requiring any manual modifications from our customers.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"a-better-internet-for-everyone\">A better Internet, for everyone</h3>\n      <a href=\"#a-better-internet-for-everyone\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In the past, we invested in efforts like <a href=\"/sha-1-deprecation-no-browser-left-behind/\">“No Browsers Left Behind”</a> to help ensure that we could continue to support clients as SHA-1 based algorithms were being deprecated. Now, we’re applying the same approach for the upcoming Let’s Encrypt change.</p><p>We have made the decision to remove Let’s Encrypt as a certificate authority from all flows where Cloudflare dictates the CA, impacting Universal SSL customers and those using SSL for SaaS with the “default CA” choice.</p><p>Starting in June 2024, one certificate lifecycle (90 days) before the cross-sign chain expires, we’ll begin migrating Let’s Encrypt certificates that are up for renewal to use a different CA, one that ensures compatibility with older devices affected by the change. That means that going forward, customers will only receive Let’s Encrypt certificates if they explicitly request Let’s Encrypt as the CA.</p><p>The change that Let&#39;s Encrypt is making is a necessary one. For us to move forward in supporting new standards and protocols, we need to make the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ecosystem more agile. By retiring the cross-signed chain, Let’s Encrypt is pushing devices, browsers, and clients to support adaptable trust stores.</p><p>However, we’ve observed <a href=\"/sha-1-deprecation-no-browser-left-behind/\">changes like this in the past</a> and while they push the adoption of new standards, they disproportionately impact users in economically disadvantaged regions, where access to new technology is limited.</p><p>Our mission is to help build a better Internet and that means supporting users worldwide. We previously published a <a href=\"/upcoming-lets-encrypt-certificate-chain-change-and-impact-for-cloudflare-customers\">blog post about the Let’s Encrypt change</a>, asking customers to switch their certificate authority if they expected any impact. However, determining the impact of the change is challenging. Error rates due to trust store incompatibility are primarily logged on clients, reducing the visibility that domain owners have. In addition, while there might be no requests incoming from incompatible devices today, it doesn’t guarantee uninterrupted access for a user tomorrow.</p><p>Cloudflare’s certificate pipeline has evolved over the years to be resilient and flexible, allowing us to seamlessly adapt to changes like this without any negative impact to our customers.  </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-cloudflare-has-built-a-robust-tls-certificate-pipeline\">How Cloudflare has built a robust TLS certificate pipeline</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-cloudflare-has-built-a-robust-tls-certificate-pipeline\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Today, Cloudflare manages tens of millions of certificates on behalf of customers.

That might seem trivial, but there are a few steps that have to successfully execute in order for a domain to receive a certificate:</p><ol><li><p>Domain owners need to complete <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/\">Domain Control Validation</a> for every certificate issuance and renewal.</p></li><li><p>The certificate authority needs to verify the Domain Control Validation tokens to issue the certificate.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/troubleshooting/caa-records/\">CAA records</a>, which dictate which CAs can be used for a domain, need to be checked to ensure only authorized parties can issue the certificate.</p></li><li><p>The certificate authority must be available to issue the certificate.</p></li></ol><p>Each of these steps requires coordination across a number of parties — domain owners, CDNs, and certificate authorities. At Cloudflare, we like to be in control when it comes to the success of our platform. That’s why we make it our job to ensure each of these steps can be successfully completed.</p><p>We ensure that every certificate issuance and renewal requires minimal effort from our customers. To get a certificate, a domain owner has to complete Domain Control Validation (DCV) to prove that it does in fact own the domain. Once the certificate request is initiated, the CA will return DCV tokens which the domain owner will need to place in a DNS record or an HTTP token. If you’re using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, Cloudflare completes DCV on your behalf by automatically placing the TXT token returned from the CA into your DNS records. Alternatively, if you use an external DNS provider, we offer the option to <a href=\"/introducing-dcv-delegation/\">Delegate DCV</a> to Cloudflare for automatic renewals without any customer intervention.</p><p>Once DCV tokens are placed, Certificate Authorities (CAs) verify them. CAs conduct this <a href=\"/secure-certificate-issuance\">verification from multiple vantage points</a> to prevent spoofing attempts. However, since these checks are done from multiple countries and ASNs (Autonomous Systems), they may trigger a Cloudflare WAF rule which can cause the DCV check to get blocked. We made sure to update our WAF and security engine to recognize that these requests are coming from a CA to ensure they&#39;re never blocked so DCV can be successfully completed.</p><p>Some customers have CA preferences, due to internal requirements or compliance regulations. To prevent an unauthorized CA from issuing a certificate for a domain, the domain owner can create a Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS record, specifying which CAs are allowed to issue a certificate for that domain. To ensure that customers can always obtain a certificate, we check the CAA records before requesting a certificate to know which CAs we should use. If the CAA records block all of the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/certificate-authorities/\">CAs that are available</a> in Cloudflare’s pipeline and the customer has not uploaded a certificate from the CA of their choice, then we add CAA records on our customers’ behalf to ensure that they can get a certificate issued. Where we can, we optimize for preference. Otherwise, it’s our job to prevent an outage by ensuring that there’s always a TLS certificate available for the domain, even if it does not come from a preferred CA.</p><p>Today, Cloudflare is not a publicly trusted certificate authority, so we rely on the CAs that we use to be highly available. But, 100% uptime is an unrealistic expectation. Instead, our pipeline needs to be prepared in case our CAs become unavailable.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"ensuring-that-ca-related-issues-have-zero-impact-on-our-customers-ability-to-obtain-a-certificate\">Ensuring that CA-related issues have zero impact on our customer’s ability to obtain a certificate</h4>\n      <a href=\"#ensuring-that-ca-related-issues-have-zero-impact-on-our-customers-ability-to-obtain-a-certificate\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>At Cloudflare, we like to think ahead, which means preventing incidents before they happen.

This shift helps minimize the risk of a key compromise. When certificates are renewed every 90 days, their private keys remain valid for only that period, reducing the window of time that a bad actor can make use of the compromised material.</p><p>We fully embrace this change and have made 90 days the default certificate validity period. This enhances our security posture by ensuring regular key rotations, and has pushed us to develop tools like DCV Delegation that promote <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/certificate-lifecycle-management/\">automation</a> around frequent certificate renewals, without the added overhead. It’s what enables us to offer certificates with validity periods as low as two weeks, for customers that want to rotate their private keys at a high frequency without any concern that it will lead to certificate renewal failures.</p><p>Cloudflare has always been at the forefront of new protocols and standards. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2014/cloudflare-offers-the-industrys-first-universal-ssl-for-free/\">It’s no secret</a> that when we support a new protocol, adoption skyrockets. This month, we will be adding <a href=\"/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet\">ECDSA</a> support for certificates issued from <a href=\"https://pki.goog/\">Google Trust Services</a>. With <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dnssec/ecdsa-and-dnssec/\">ECDSA</a>, you get the same level of security as RSA but with smaller keys.

This doesn’t just benefit Cloudflare’s customers, but it helps the Internet by requiring CAs to handle higher volumes of issuance.</p><p>And now, with Let’s Encrypt shortening their chain of trust, we’re going to add an additional improvement to our pipeline — one that will ensure the best device compatibility for all.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"supporting-all-clients-legacy-and-modern\">Supporting all clients — legacy and modern</h4>\n      <a href=\"#supporting-all-clients-legacy-and-modern\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The upcoming Let’s Encrypt change will prevent legacy devices from making requests to domains or applications that are protected by a Let’s Encrypt certificate.
