	<p>Building modern full-stack applications requires connecting to many hosted third party services, from observability platforms to databases and more. All too often, this means spending time doing busywork, managing credentials and writing glue code just to get started. This is why we’re building out the Cloudflare Integrations Marketplace to allow developers to easily discover, configure and deploy products to use with Workers.</p>
	<p>Earlier this year, we introduced integrations with <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-database-integrations">Supabase, PlanetScale, Neon</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-database-integration-with-upstash">Upstash</a>. Today, we are thrilled to introduce our newest additions to Cloudflare’s Integrations Marketplace – <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/sentry-integration">Sentry</a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/native-integrations/turso">Turso</a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/native-integrations/momento">Momento</a>.</p>
	<p>Let's take a closer look at some of the exciting integration providers that are now part of the Workers Integration Marketplace.</p>
	<h3>Improve performance and reliability by connecting Workers to Sentry</h3>
	<p>When your Worker encounters an error you want to know what happened and exactly what line of code triggered it. <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome">Sentry</a> is an <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/app-performance-monitoring">application monitoring</a> platform that helps developers identify and resolve issues in real-time.</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/sentry-integration">Workers and Sentry integration</a> automatically sends errors, exceptions and <code>console.log()</code> messages from your Worker to Sentry with no code changes required. Here’s how it works:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>You enable the integration from the Cloudflare Dashboard.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>The credentials from the Sentry project of your choice are automatically added to your Worker.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>You can configure <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/sampling/#configuring-the-transaction-sample-rate">sampling</a> to control the volume of events you want sent to Sentry. This includes selecting the sample rate for different status codes and exceptions.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Cloudflare deploys a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/tail-workers">Tail Worker</a> behind the scenes that contains all the logic needed to capture and send data to Sentry.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Like magic, errors, exceptions, and log messages are automatically sent to your Sentry project.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In the future, we’ll be improving this integration by adding support for uploading source maps and stack traces so that you can pinpoint exactly which line of your code caused the issue. We’ll also be tying in <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/deployments">Workers deployments</a> with <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/product/releases">Sentry releases</a> to correlate new versions of your Worker with events in Sentry that help pinpoint problematic deployments. Check out our <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/sentry-integration">developer documentation</a> for more information.</p>
	<h3>Develop at the Data Edge with Turso + Workers</h3>
	<p><a href="https://turso.tech">Turso</a> is an edge-hosted, distributed database based on libSQL, an open-source fork of SQLite. Turso focuses on providing a global service that minimizes query latency (and thus, application latency!). It’s perfect for use with Cloudflare Workers – both compute and data are served close to users.</p>
	<p>Turso follows the model of having one primary database with replicas that are located globally, close to users. Turso automatically routes requests to a replica closest to where the Worker was invoked. This model works very efficiently for read heavy applications since read requests can be served globally. If you’re running an application that has heavy write workloads, or want to cut down on replication costs, you can run Turso with just the <a href="https://docs.turso.tech/concepts#primary">primary</a> instance and use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/smart-placement">Smart Placement</a> to speed up queries.</p>
	<p>The Turso and Workers integration automatically pulls in Turso API credentials and adds them as secrets to your Worker, so that you can start using Turso by simply establishing a connection using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@libsql/client">libsql SDK</a>. Get started with the Turso and Workers Integration today by heading to our <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/native-integrations/turso">developer documentation</a>.</p>
	<h3>Cache responses from data stores with Momento</h3>
	<p><a href="https://www.gomomento.com/services/cache">Momento Cache</a> is a low latency serverless caching solution that can be used on top of relational databases, key-value databases or object stores to get faster load times and better performance. Momento abstracts details like scaling, warming and replication so that users can deploy cache in a matter of minutes.</p>
	<p>The Momento and Workers integration automatically pulls in your Momento API key using an OAuth2 flow. The Momento API key is added as a secret in Workers and, from there, you can start using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gomomento/sdk">Momento SDK</a> in Workers. Head to our <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/native-integrations/momento">developer documentation</a> to learn more and use the Momento and Workers integration!</p>
	<h3>Try integrations out today</h3>
	<p>We want to give you back time, so that you can focus less on configuring and connecting third party tools to Workers and spend more time building. We’re excited to see what you build with integrations. Share your projects with us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/cloudflaredev">@CloudflareDev</a>) and stay tuned for more exciting updates as we continue to grow our Integrations Marketplace!</p>
