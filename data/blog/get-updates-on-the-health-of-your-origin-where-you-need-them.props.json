The Health Checks product provides a similarly powerful interface to Load Balancing, offering users the ability to ensure their origins meet criteria such as reachability, responsiveness, correct HTTP status codes, and correct HTTP body content. Customers can also receive email alerts when a Health Check finds their origin is unhealthy based on their custom criteria. In building a more focused product, we’ve added a slimmer, monitoring-based configuration, Health Check Analytics, and made it available for all paid customers. Health Checks run in multiple locations within Cloudflare’s edge network, meaning customers can monitor site performance across geographic locations.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"whats-new-with-health-checks-notifications\">What’s new with Health Checks Notifications</h2>\n            <a href=\"#whats-new-with-health-checks-notifications\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Health Checks email alerts have allowed customers to respond quickly to incidents and guarantee minimum disruption for their users. As before, Health Checks users can still select up to 20 email recipients to notify if a Health Check finds their site to be unhealthy. And if email is the right tool for your team, we’re excited to share that we have jazzed up our notification emails and added details on which Health Check triggered the notification, as well as the status of the Health Check:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6wQaM5dANtGNveurNe8YL8/d434cccbdc1d10ac58372616797710c5/image9-1.png\" alt=\"New Health Checks email format with Time, Health Status, and Health Check details\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"952\" height=\"584\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>New Health Checks email format with Time, Health Status, and Health Check details</i></p><p>That being said, monitoring an inbox is not ideal for many customers needing to stay proactively informed. If email is not the communication channel your team typically relies upon, checking emails can at best be inconvenient and, at worst, allow critical updates to be missed. That&#39;s where the Notifications dashboard comes in.</p><p>Users can now create Health Checks notifications within the Cloudflare Notifications dashboard. By integrating Health Checks with Cloudflare&#39;s powerful Notification platform, we have unlocked myriad new ways to ensure customers receive critical updates for their origin health. One of the key benefits of Cloudflare&#39;s Notifications is webhooks, which give customers the flexibility to sync notifications with various external services. Webhook responses contain JSON-encoded information, allowing users to ingest them into their internal or third-party systems.</p><p>For real-time updates, users can now use webhooks to send Health Check alerts directly to their preferred instant messaging platforms such as Slack, Google Chat, or Microsoft Teams, to name a few. Beyond instant messaging, customers can also use webhooks to send Health Checks notifications to their internal APIs or their <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-siem/\">Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</a> platforms, such as DataDog or Splunk, giving customers a single pane of glass for all Cloudflare activity, including notifications and event logs. For more on how to configure popular webhooks, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/notifications/create-notifications/configure-webhooks\">check out our developer docs</a>. Below, we&#39;ll walk you through a couple of powerful webhook applications. But first, let&#39;s highlight a couple of other ways the update to Health Checks notifications improves user experience.</p><p>By including Health Checks in the Notifications tab, users need only to access one page for a single source of truth where they can manage their account notifications.  For added ease of use, users can also migrate to Notification setup directly from the Health Check creation page as well.  From within a Health Check, users will also be able to see what Notifications are tied to it.</p><p>Additionally, configuring notifications for multiple Health Checks is now simplified. Instead of configuring notifications one Health Check at a time, users can now set up notifications for multiple or even all Health Checks from a single workflow.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5KkiuxbDOJYQxkDjWPkkeu/2dc8a98cdcdf92a5fa2c924a8fd9ecf7/image6-8.png\" alt=\"Notification creation workflow:  Tie one or multiple Health Checks to the same notification and select notification trigger–Becomes unhealthy, Becomes healthy, or both.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1844\" height=\"1194\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Also, users can now access Health Checks notification history, and Enterprise customers can integrate Health Checks <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/notifications/create-notifications/create-pagerduty\">directly with PagerDuty</a>. Last but certainly not least, as Cloudflare’s Notifications infrastructure grows in capabilities, Health Checks will be able to leverage all of these improvements. This guarantees Health Checks users the most timely and versatile notification capabilities that Cloudflare offers now and into the future.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"setting-up-a-health-checks-webhook\">Setting up a Health Checks webhook</h2>\n            <a href=\"#setting-up-a-health-checks-webhook\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>To get notifications for health changes at an origin, <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404867308429-About-Health-Checks\">we first need to set up a Health Check for it.</a> In this example, we&#39;ll monitor HTTP responses: leave the Type and adjacent fields to their defaults.

Using the Health Check we configured in our last example, let’s create a simple status page using Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects that stores an origin’s health, updates it upon receiving a webhook request, and displays a status page to visitors.</p><p><b>Writing our worker</b>You can find the code for this example <a href=\"https://github.com/georgethomas111/status-page\">in this GitHub repository</a>, if you want to clone it and try it out.</p><p>We’ve got our Health Check set up, and we’re ready to write our worker and durable object. To get started, we first need to <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update\">install</a> wrangler, our CLI tool for testing and deploying more complex worker setups.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ wrangler -V\nwrangler 1.19.8</pre></code>\n            <p>The examples in this blog were tested in this wrangler version.</p><p>Then, to speed up writing our worker, we will use a template to generate a project:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ wrangler generate status-page [https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-template](https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-template)\n$ cd status-page</pre></code>\n            <p>The template has a Durable Object with the name <code>Counter</code>. We’ll rename that to <code>Status</code>, as it will store and update the current state of the page.</p><p>For that, we update <code>wrangler.toml</code> to use the correct name and type, and rename the <code>Counter</code> class in <code>index.mjs</code>.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">name = &quot;status-page&quot;\n# type = &quot;javascript&quot; is required to use the `[build]` section\ntype = &quot;javascript&quot;\nworkers_dev = true\naccount_id = &quot;&lt;Cloudflare account-id&gt;&quot;\nroute = &quot;&quot;\nzone_id = &quot;&quot;\ncompatibility_date = &quot;2022-02-11&quot;\n \n[build.upload]\n# Upload the code directly from the src directory.\ndir = &quot;src&quot;\n# The &quot;modules&quot; upload format is required for all projects that export a Durable Objects class\nformat = &quot;modules&quot;\nmain = &quot;./index.mjs&quot;\n \n[durable_objects]\nbindings = [{name = &quot;status&quot;, class_name = &quot;Status&quot;}]</pre></code>\n            <p>Now, we’re ready to fill in our logic. We want to serve two different kinds of requests: one at <code>/webhook</code> that we will pass to the Notification system for updating the status, and another at <code>/</code> for a rendered status page.</p><p>First, let’s write the <code>/webhook</code> logic.

However, anyone possessing the webhook URL would be able to forge a request, pushing arbitrary data to an externally-visible dashboard. Obviously, that’s not ideal. Thankfully, webhooks provide the ability to authenticate these requests by supplying a secret. Let’s create a new webhook that will provide a secret on every request. We can generate a secret by generating a pseudo-random UUID with Python:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\">$ python3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import uuid\n&gt;&gt;&gt; uuid.uuid4()\nUUID(&#039;4de28cf2-4a1f-4abd-b62e-c8d69569a4d2&#039;)</pre></code>\n            <p>Now we create a new webhook with the secret.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3DvDHuoGw8qliF2bsYP7rZ/abb33648da7c964d423b5972ec1ea478/image3-42.png\" alt=\"Webhook creation page, with the following user input: name of webhook, destination URL, and now with a secret added.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1032\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Webhook creation page, with the following user input: name of webhook, destination URL, and now with a secret added.</i></p><p>We also want to provide this secret to our worker. Wrangler has a command that lets us save the secret.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_SECRET\nEnter the secret text you&#039;d like assigned to the variable WEBHOOK_SECRET on the script named status-page:\n4de28cf2-4a1f-4abd-b62e-c8d69569a4d2\n? Creating the secret for script name status-page\n✨ Success! Uploaded secret WEBHOOK_SECRET.</pre></code>\n            <p>Wrangler will prompt us for the secret, then provide it to our worker. Now we can check for the token upon every webhook notification, as the secret is provided by the header <code>cf-webhook-auth</code>. By checking the header’s value against our secret, we can authenticate incoming webhook notifications as genuine. To do that, we modify <code>handleWebhook</code>:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"> async handleWebhook(request) {\n  // ensure the request we receive is from the Webhook destination we created\n  // by examining its secret value, and rejecting it if it&#039;s incorrect\n  if((request.headers.get(&#039;cf-webhook-auth&#039;) != this.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET) {\n    return\n   }\n  ...old code here\n }</pre></code>\n            <p>This origin health status page is just one example of the versatility of webhooks, which allowed us to leverage Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects to support a custom Health Checks application. From highly custom use cases such as this to more straightforward, out-of-the-box solutions, pairing webhooks and Health Checks empowers users to respond to critical origin health updates effectively by delivering that information where it will be most impactful.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"migrating-to-the-notifications-dashboard\">Migrating to the Notifications Dashboard</h2>\n            <a href=\"#migrating-to-the-notifications-dashboard\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>The Notifications dashboard is now the centralized location for most Cloudflare services.
