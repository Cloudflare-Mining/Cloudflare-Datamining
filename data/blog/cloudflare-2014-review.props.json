Now when we make a change, the needles on the Internet&#39;s dials move: when we roll out support for new protocols, sites tracking those protocols see a sudden jump in usage.</p><p>Here&#39;s a month by month review of CloudFlare&#39;s 2014:</p><p><b>January 8</b>: keeping our promise to Latin America, we <a href=\"/bienvenido-a-chile-cloudflares-24th-data-center-now-live/\">opened our first data center there in Chile</a>.</p><p><b>January 27</b>: we published our <a href=\"/cloudflare-transparency-report-on-national-security-orders/\">first transparency report covering National Security Orders</a> on the first day it became legal to discuss them.</p><p><b>February 13</b>: we published details of a <a href=\"/technical-details-behind-a-400gbps-ntp-amplification-ddos-attack/\">massive DDoS attack</a> (that peaked at almost 400Gbps).</p><p><b>February 14</b>: we introduced a new <a href=\"/introducing-strict-ssl-protecting-against-a-man-in-the-middle-attack-on-origin-traffic/\">Strict SSL mode</a> to ensure that connections between CloudFlare and customer web servers could not be subject to a MITM attack.</p><p><b>February 17</b>: we rolled out support for the most recent version of the <a href=\"/staying-up-to-date-with-the-latest-protocols-spdy-3-1/\">SPDY protocol (SPDY/3.1)</a>.</p><p><b>April 3</b>: we rolled out support for <a href=\"/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/\">CNAME flattening</a> that includes the zone root.</p><p><b>April 7</b>: March 2014 had been very quiet, but it was the calm before the storm. On this day, the Heartbleed vulnerability became public. CloudFlare clients were <a href=\"/staying-ahead-of-openssl-vulnerabilities/\">protected</a>, but that wasn&#39;t the end of the story.</p><p>Four days later, we set up the <a href=\"/answering-the-critical-question-can-you-get-private-ssl-keys-using-heartbleed/\">Heartbleed Challenge</a> to determine if private keys were obtainable using Heartbleed. Nine hours after the start of our challange, we had the definitive bad news: yes, private keys could be obtained.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7xXqlOdHgCMZddhZ6KCk9t/56ab9c31b7612a79542f77005eac62f4/Screen_Shot_2014-04-17_at_10.53.46.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1110\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Because private keys could have been vulnerable, CloudFlare then <a href=\"/the-heartbleed-aftermath-all-cloudflare-certificates-revoked-and-reissued/\">revoked every SSL certificate</a> that we&#39;d issued and caused the CRL to grow massively in an unprecedented fashion. Later, we gave a detailed analysis of <a href=\"/searching-for-the-prime-suspect-how-heartbleed-leaked-private-keys/\">how the private keys could leak</a> with Heartbleed.</p><p><b>May 3</b>: we began publishing our <a href=\"/tracking-our-ssl-configuration/\">SSL configuration</a> so that others could use it.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5wyCWsZq7yP7N2HkYyRlI4/58957c13927e834f432a6778c47f7908/RC4_chart.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1934\" height=\"830\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>May 7</b>: faced with the fact that RC4 looked more and more vulnerable, we <a href=\"/killing-rc4-the-long-goodbye/\">removed RC4 as a preferred cipher</a> and saw an instant drop in the number of connections using it.

Much more: new data centers all over the globe (including in China), new product lines that we haven&#39;t hinted at and some we have (e.g. DNSSEC support), and lots of surprises. This year, we plan on adding more equipment and network capacity than we have in CloudFlare&#39;s combined first five years.</p><p>Best wishes for 2015.</p><p><b>If your New Year&#39;s Resolution is to look for a change of employment (and you fancy working in London or San Francisco), check out our </b><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/join-our-team\"><b>openings</b></a><b>.</b></p>",
