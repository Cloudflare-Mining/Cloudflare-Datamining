With all the hard work that goes into the development process — turning mock-ups to code, getting input from your team, staging and testing changes — you want the best performance possible for your site to showcase your work and optimize your customers’ experience.</p><p>Cloudflare Pages is the most secure and most scalable Jamstack platform to build and deploy your sites on the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-edge-computing/\">edge</a>.

We are proud of both driving and adopting the latest web standards. Our mission has always been to help build a better Internet, and collaborating on the latest standards is an essential part of that goal, especially when thinking about your Pages sites.</p><p><b>TLS 1.3:</b> As the new encryption protocol, TLS 1.3 sets out to improve both speed and security for Internet users everywhere. With 1.3, during the course of that infamous “TLS handshake” you hear so much about, only one round trip, or back and forth communication, is required instead of two, thus shortening the process by milliseconds. A huge step forward for web security and performance, TLS 1.3 is available to all Pages users with no additional action required --- let the client and server handle it all.</p><p><b>IPv6:</b> Today it’s extremely common for every person to have more than one Internet connected device, making the shift to IPv6 extremely crucial, now more than ever. Not only is IPv6 the answer to the “no more addresses” issue, but is also another added layer for performance and security with its ability to handle packets more efficiently, getting faster and faster as adoption of the standard increases.</p><p><b>QUIC &amp; HTTP/3:</b> The new internet transport protocol, QUIC &amp; HTTP/3, team up to enable faster, reliable and more secure connections for your customers to web endpoints like your Pages site. QUIC, a transport layer protocol, aims to reduce connection and transport latency and avoid congestion and runs underneath HTTP/3. Enabled by default on every <b>pages.dev</b> domain, <a href=\"/last-call-for-quic/\">QUIC &amp; HTTP/3</a> work in tandem to provide improved performance and security so long as the client complies.</p><p>With support for the latest standards like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/\">HTTP/3</a> and IPv6, as we work on support for dynamic frameworks, we will be able to offer response streaming, a feature other platforms don’t provide.</p><blockquote><p><b>&quot;Pages gives us more confidence than other providers, making it easier to migrate our app over and build new products that can easily scale with growing traffic.&quot;</b> — <i>David Simpson, COO at</i> <a href=\"http://designed.org/\"><i>Designed.org</i></a></p></blockquote><p>But we know that speed doesn’t just matter from a user perspective.

From the time we launched Pages, we’ve been working on making our build times faster every day. Today, Pages builds are 3x faster than they were when we first launched the platform, but we’re not done yet. We’re aiming to have the fastest build times, so you can focus on what you do best — code, test, deploy, repeat — minus any wait.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"performance-tuning-built-in\">Performance tuning, built in</h3>\n            <a href=\"#performance-tuning-built-in\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In May of last year, Google announced a new program — <a href=\"https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals\">Web Core Vitals</a> — to provide unified guidance on how to measure the quality of a website, and to identify areas of improvement for developers, business owners, and marketers to deliver a better user experience. There are three key metrics as part of the program:</p><ul><li><p><b>Largest Contentful Paint</b>: measures loading performance</p></li><li><p><b>First Input Delay</b>: measure interactivity</p></li><li><p><b>Cumulative Layout Shift</b>: measures visual stability</p></li></ul><p>Fast-forward a year to 2021, Google <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience\">officially announced</a> that performance on these metrics will now be incorporated into Google Search results.</p><p>Performance is becoming an ever important aspect of the success of any site on the web.</p><p>We recognize this, and it’s part of why we’re so relentlessly focused on making sites hosted on Pages so fast. But you don’t need to just take our word for it. In addition to providing you with stellar performance across the globe, our Web Analytics tool is available to Pages customers with one click — so you can track your site’s Web Core Vitals and understand specific areas of improvement. As an example, here’s the Web Analytics on our very own <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Docs</a> site.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/p0YSeN6MtJkwiEDrdQipY/d3e74072d7ff6d8458dac5a1fa1f9d02/image3-27.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"570\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We’re big believers in dogfooding — running our Docs site on Pages, and then using our Web Analytics to identify areas of improvement. It’s a big part of the Cloudflare ethos, and it’s how we can be confident in recommending our products to you.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"whats-next\">What’s Next</h2>\n            <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>With the increasing momentum behind the Jamstack movement, it’s a great time to be in the field. With Pages, you can rest easy knowing you’re taken care of every step of the way. We are so excited about the future of Cloudflare Pages --- integrating with Cloudflare Workers, supporting monorepos, enabling more sources of repo integration --- and how it brings a fresh perspective on how you build and deploy your sites on the web.</p><p>Check our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/\">docs</a> to get started on Cloudflare Pages today!</p>",
