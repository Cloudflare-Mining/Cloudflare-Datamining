However, it seems that threat actors are still behind, as thirteen of the top user agents that appeared most frequently in DDoS attacks were Chrome versions ranging from 118 to 129.</p><p>The HITV_ST_PLATFORM user agent had the highest share of DDoS requests out of total requests (99.9%), making it the user agent that’s used almost exclusively in DDoS attacks. In other words, if you see traffic coming from the HITV_ST_PLATFORM user agent, there is a 0.1% chance that it is legitimate traffic.</p><p>Threat actors often avoid using uncommon user agents, favoring more common ones like Chrome to blend in with regular traffic. The presence of the HITV_ST_PLATFORM user agent, which is associated with smart TVs and set-top boxes, suggests that the devices involved in certain cyberattacks are compromised smart TVs or set-top boxes. This observation highlights the importance of securing all Internet-connected devices, including smart TVs and set-top boxes, to prevent them from being exploited in cyberattacks.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5uUCjjPdGu63u7OmgRE6Yw/4b15c1e88cfe86ae0bc5824346908b24/image18.png\" alt=\"image18\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1274\" height=\"737\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Top user agents abused in DDoS attacks: 2024 Q4</i></sup></p><p>The user agent <a href=\"https://github.com/benoitc/hackney\"><u>hackney</u></a> came in second place, with 93% of requests containing this user agent being part of a DDoS attack.
