The African west coast has seen a boom and, the East African coast (where Djibouti is located) has seen even more of a boom with fiber-optic cables radiating outwards towards the Middle East, India, Asia, Southern Africa and Europe from Djibouti. The list of submarine fiber-optic cables that land at Djibouti seems to be increasing year-over-year. Recently the SeaMeWe-5 cable was brought into service. SeaMeWe stands for “South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe”. It connects <a href=\"/marseille/\">Marseille France</a> (via a landing station in Toulon, France) through <a href=\"/cairo/\">Egypt</a>, into Djibouti, then across to Sri Lanka and finaly finishing up in <a href=\"/cloudflares-singapore-data-center-now-online/\">Singapore</a>.

Landlocked countries are highly dependent on their path towards an ocean for access to the global Internet. That makes Djibouti a perfect location to provide Cloudflare services for specific areas of Eastern or Central Africa.</p><p>Right next to the landing station in Djibouti is the <a href=\"https://peeringdb.com/ix/967\">Djibouti Internet Exchange</a> (DjIX) which is located inside the <a href=\"http://www.djiboutidatacenter.com/en/page/about\">Djibouti Data Center</a> (DDC). They are separate buildings; however, highly interconnected. Cloudflare is a member of the DjIX and because of that internet exchange we expect to increase our connectivity up and down the East Coast of Africa.</p><p>If you’re interested to learn more about global undersea cables, look forward to a follow up deep dive (pun intended) blog post.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"railways-and-fiber\">Railways and fiber</h3>\n      <a href=\"#railways-and-fiber\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Back around the start of the 20th century, the French built a one-meter gauge railway between the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and the deep-water port in Djibouti.

This standard gauge international railway connects Addis Ababa and the Port of Doraleh in Djibouti. It’s used for freight, passengers and communications. The two railways are somewhat parallel and are the perfect path for fiber-optic cables linking Addis Ababa and Djibouti and hence connecting Ethiopia to the rest of the world. It’s very common for railways to be associated with fiber-optic cables.

Whilst they still represent significant distances and hence latency (the speed of light hasn’t changed as far as we can tell); they are not the economic barrier they once were. In fact, in some cases they can be very cost-effective at moving bits globally. Undersea cables have been pushing the barriers for Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) and optical encoding for quite some time. A single fiber-optic cable can now encode data in the multi-Terabit range (16 or 32 Tbps is not complex to implement anymore). This eclipses anything that satellites can provide!</p><p>When an undersea cable surfaces (actually they are always buried, as they traverse the beaches on the ocean edges, before reaching the landing stations where the optical signal is converted into an electrical signal, as it ultimately reaches an Internet core router or Internet Exchange Point (IXP).</p><p>If you ever have the privilege of visiting a cable landing station, you’re in for a wonderful treat.

In fact datacenter number 107 was <a href=\"/belgrade-107th-datacenter/\"><b>B</b>elgrade</a>, number 108 is <b>C</b>uraçao and number 109 <b>D</b>jibouti. It seems we like the letters BCD so much that we have four more BCD data center cities presently being deployed. There’s one <b>B</b>, two <b>C</b>s and one <b>D</b> within the upcoming weeks and months. Want to guess the cities? Here&#39;s a clue. Two north of the Equator, one close to the Equator and one quite south of the Equator. The Cloudflare deployment continues all over the globe!</p><p>If you’re interest in bringing the fast Internet infrastructure of Cloudflare into diverse locations like these, then check out the jobs we have <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/departments/\">listed online</a>.</p>",
