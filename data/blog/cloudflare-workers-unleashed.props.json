At the time, we didn&#39;t yet know what that would mean. Would it be container-based? A new Turing-incomplete domain-specific language? Lua? &quot;Functions&quot;? There were lots of ideas.</p><p>Eventually, we settled on what now seems the obvious choice: JavaScript, using the standard Service Workers API, running in a new environment built on V8. Five months ago, we <a href=\"/introducing-cloudflare-workers/\">gave you a preview</a> of what we were building, and started the beta.</p><p>Today, with thousands of scripts deployed and many billions of requests served, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/workers/\">Cloudflare Workers</a> is now ready for everyone.</p><p>&quot;Moving away from VCL and adopting Cloudflare Workers will allow us to do some creative routing that will let us deliver JavaScript to npm&#39;s millions of users even faster than we do now. We will be building our next generation of services on Cloudflare&#39;s platform and we get to do it in JavaScript!&quot;</p><p>— CJ Silverio, CTO, npm, Inc.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"what-is-the-cloud-really\">What is the Cloud, really?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#what-is-the-cloud-really\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Historically, web application code has been split between servers and browsers. Between them lies a vast but fundamentally <i>dumb</i> network which merely ferries data from point to point.</p><p>We don&#39;t believe this lives up to the promise of &quot;The Cloud.&quot;</p><p>We believe the true dream of cloud computing is that your code lives in the network itself. Your code doesn&#39;t run in &quot;us-west-4&quot; or &quot;South Central Asia (Mumbai)&quot;, it runs <i>everywhere</i>.</p><p>More concretely, it should run where it is most needed. When responding to a user in New Zealand, your code should run in New Zealand. When crunching data in your database, your code should run on the machines that store the data. When interacting with a third-party API, your code should run wherever that API is hosted. When human explorers reach Mars, they aren&#39;t going to be happy waiting a half an hour for your app to respond -- your code needs to be running on Mars.</p><p>Cloudflare Workers are our first step towards this vision. When you deploy a Worker, it is deployed to Cloudflare&#39;s entire edge network of over a hundred locations worldwide in under 30 seconds. Each request for your domain will be handled by your Worker at a Cloudflare location close to the end user, with no need for you to think about individual locations. The more locations we bring online, the more your code just &quot;runs everywhere.&quot;</p><p>Well, OK… it won&#39;t run on Mars. Yet.
