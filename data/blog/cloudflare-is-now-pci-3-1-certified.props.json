It ensures that any company processing credit card transactions adheres to the highest technical standards.</p><p>PCI certification has several levels. Level one (the highest level) is reserved for those companies that handle the greatest numbers of credit cards. Companies at level one PCI compliance are subject to the most stringent checks.</p><p>CloudFlare’s mission leads it to provide security for some of the most important companies in the world. This is why CloudFlare chose to be audited as a level one service provider. By adhering to PCI’s rigorous financial security controls, CloudFlare ensures that security is held to the highest standard and that those controls are validated independently by a recognised body.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more, see these <a href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/\">details about the</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/\">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</a>.</p><p>This year’s update <a href=\"/cloudflare-is-pci-certified/\">from PCI 2.0</a> to 3.1 was long overdue.

This was leading to a culture of &quot;tickbox security&quot; where organizations would do the bare minimum during the year, then rush to make the necessary changes to meet compliance requirements in time for their audit. This is a bad way to do security.</p><p>Security should be holistic and ongoing. A company should ensure that security is built into every level of the organization. Security features should be incorporated into products from the ground up. Not only is this the least expensive way to do security, but it is also the most secure way.</p><p>To this end, PCI 3.1 was designed to integrate into the everyday operations of a compliant organization. This integration ranges from installing itself in critical operational processes, to ensuring that PCI compliance is an integral part of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that the company uses to build its products. PCI is present at every level of the operation.</p><p>Furthermore, PCI now requires that the processes which support these critical business functions are robust. This means that things like the patch management process or vulnerability testing process have a clearly defined owner, a clearly defined review process, and a clear timetable.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"further-addressing-tickbox-security\">Further addressing \"tickbox security\"</h3>\n            <a href=\"#further-addressing-tickbox-security\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Another aspect of the &quot;tickbox security&quot; culture that developed around PCI 2.0 was the fact that it was possible to use documentation to fool the audit process.

It is no longer sufficient to say, &quot;here is some paperwork about this control.&quot; The control itself has to be tested and evaluated by the auditor before the organization can be passed as compliant. Furthermore, PCI 3.1 also insists on vulnerability testing on a regular basis at every stage of the development lifecycle. This requirement is designed to catch weaknesses that might have slipped through the cracks and to detect software vulnerabilities that somehow missed getting patched.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"shared-responsibility\">Shared responsibility</h3>\n            <a href=\"#shared-responsibility\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>It has become clear to many information security practitioners that security is a complex, multi-actor deliverable.

The problem is that encryption has a shelf-life. As time passes, flaws are found in these systems, and computing performance reaches a level where it can break widespread encryption algorithms. Eventually, the encryption technology of yesterday no longer offers the same amount of protection as when it was first released.</p><p>With PCI 3.1, the payment card industry recognises this by setting a &quot;sunset date&quot; for old encryption standards. In order to remain compliant after June 30 2016, companies must switch off SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1. This is a step in the right direction, and it affects CloudFlare as much as it affects our customers.</p><p>However, a significant amount of the world still uses TLS 1.0 (14% of traffic last time we looked). We recognise that not everyone wants, or needs, to do this.
