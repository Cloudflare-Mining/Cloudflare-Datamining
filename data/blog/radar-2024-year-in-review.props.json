The <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024\"><u>Cloudflare Radar 2024 Year In Review</u></a> microsite continues that tradition, featuring interactive charts, graphs, and maps you can use to explore and compare notable Internet trends observed throughout this past year.</p><p>Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network\"><u>network</u></a> currently spans more than 330 cities in over 120 countries/regions, serving an average of over 63 million HTTP(S) requests per second for millions of Internet properties, in addition to handling over 42 million DNS requests per second on average. The resulting data generated by this usage, combined with data from other complementary Cloudflare tools, enables Radar to provide unique near-real time perspectives on the patterns and trends around security, traffic, performance, and usage that we observe across the Internet. </p><p>The 2024 Year In Review is organized into five sections: <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#traffic\"><u>Traffic</u></a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#adoption-and-usage\"><u>Adoption &amp; Usage</u></a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#connectivity\"><u>Connectivity</u></a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#security\"><u>Security</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#email-security\"><u>Email Security</u></a> and covers the period from January 1 to December 1, 2024. We have incorporated several new metrics this year, including AI bot &amp; crawler traffic, search engine and browser market share, connection tampering, and “most dangerous” top level domains (TLDs). To ensure consistency, we have kept underlying methodologies consistent with previous years’ calculations. Trends for 200 countries/regions are available on the microsite; smaller or less populated locations are excluded due to insufficient data. Some metrics are only shown worldwide, and are not displayed if a country/region is selected. </p><p>Below, we provide an overview of the content contained within the major Year In Review sections (Traffic, Adoption &amp; Usage, Connectivity, Security, and Email Security), along with notable observations and key findings. In addition, we have also published a companion blog post that specifically explores trends seen across <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2024-year-in-review-internet-services/\"><u>Top Internet Services</u></a>.</p><p>The key findings and associated discussion within this post only provide a high-level perspective on the unique insights that can be found in the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024\"><u>Year in Review microsite</u></a>. Visit the microsite to explore the various datasets and metrics in more detail, including trends seen in your country/region, how these trends have changed as compared to 2023, and how they compare to other countries/regions of interest.

The World Wide Web went mainstream in 1994, thanks to the late 1993 <a href=\"https://cybercultural.com/p/1993-mosaic-launches-and-the-web-is-set-free/\"><u>release</u></a> of the <a href=\"https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/project-highlights/ncsa-mosaic/\"><u>NCSA Mosaic</u></a> browser for multiple popular operating systems, which included support for embedded images. In turn, “heavier” (in contrast to text-based) Internet content became the norm, and coupled with the growth in consumption through popular online services and the emerging consumer ISP industry, <a href=\"https://blogs.cisco.com/sp/the-history-and-future-of-internet-traffic\"><u>Internet traffic began to rapidly increase</u></a>, and that trend has continued to the present.</p><p>To determine the traffic trends over time for the Year in Review, we use the average daily traffic volume (excluding bot traffic) over the second full calendar week (January 8-15) of 2024 as our baseline. (The second calendar week is used to allow time for people to get back into their “normal” school and work routines after the winter holidays and New Year’s Day. The percent change shown in the traffic trends chart is calculated relative to the baseline value — it does not represent absolute traffic volume for a country/region. The trend line represents a seven-day trailing average, which is used to smooth the sharp changes seen with data at a daily granularity.

To do so, we can use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve\"><u>Hilbert curves</u></a>, which allow us to visualize a sequence of IPv4 addresses in a two-dimensional pattern that keeps nearby IP addresses close to each other, making them <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/195/\"><u>useful</u></a> for surveying the Internet&#39;s IPv4 address space.</p><p>Using a Hilbert curve, we can <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ipv4-traffic-distribution\"><u>visualize aggregated IPv4 request traffic to Cloudflare</u></a> from January 1 through December 1, 2024. Within the visualization, we aggregate IPv4 addresses at a <a href=\"https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/IPv4CIDRChart_2015.pdf\"><u>/20</u></a> level, meaning that at the highest zoom level, each square represents traffic from 4,096 IPv4 addresses. This aggregation is done to keep the amount of data used for the visualization manageable. (While we would like to create a similar visualization for IPv6 traffic, the enormity of the full IPv6 address space would make associated traffic very <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@vasturiano/hilbert-map-of-ipv6-address-space\"><u>hard to see</u></a> in such a visualization, especially as such a small amount has been <a href=\"https://www.iana.org/numbers/allocations/\"><u>allocated for assignment by the Regional Internet Registries</u></a>.)</p><p>Within the visualization, IP addresses are grouped by ownership, and for much of the IP address space shown there, a mouseover at the default zoom level will show the <a href=\"https://www.nro.net/about/rirs/\"><u>Regional Internet Registry (RIR)</u></a> that the address block belongs to. However, there are also a number of blocks that were assigned prior to the existence of the RIR system, and for these, they are labeled with the name of the organization that owns them. Progressive zooming ultimately shows the autonomous system and country/region that the IP address block is associated with, as well as its share of traffic relative to the maximum. (If a country/region is selected, only the IP address blocks associated with that location are visible.) Overall traffic shares are indicated by shading based on a color scale, and although a number of large unshaded blocks are visible, this does not necessarily mean that the associated address space is unused, but rather that it may be used in a way that does not generate traffic to Cloudflare.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6gtrL1H2gUjSKH7AMSabgM/361d38f34860258449a914e26519a4b4/traffic_-_Hilbert_curve.png\" alt=\"traffic - Hilbert curve\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1578\" height=\"981\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Hilbert curve showing aggregated 2024 traffic to Cloudflare across the IPv4 Internet</i></sup></p><p>Warmer orange/red shading within the visualization represents areas of higher request volume, and buried within one of those areas is the IP address block that had the maximum request volume to Cloudflare during 2024.

An <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1883\"><u>initial specification for its successor</u></a>, IPv6, was published in December 1995, evolving to a <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2460\"><u>draft standard</u></a> three years later, offering an expanded address space intended to better support the expected growth in the number of Internet-connected devices. At this point, available IPv4 space has long since been <a href=\"https://ipv4.potaroo.net/\"><u>exhausted</u></a>, and connectivity providers use solutions like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation\"><u>Network Address Translation</u></a> to stretch limited IPv4 resources. Hungry for IPv4 address space as their businesses and infrastructure grow, cloud and hosting providers are acquiring blocks of IPv4 address space for <a href=\"https://auctions.ipv4.global/\"><u>as much as \\$30 - \\$50 per address</u></a>. </p><p>Cloudflare has been a vocal and active advocate for IPv6 since 2011, when we announced our <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa/\"><u>Automatic IPv6 Gateway</u></a>, which enabled free IPv6 support for all of our customers. In 2014, we enabled <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/i-joined-cloudflare-on-monday-along-with-5-000-others\"><u>IPv6 support by default for all of our customers</u></a>, but not all customers choose to keep it enabled for a variety of reasons. Note that server-side support is only half of the equation for driving IPv6 adoption, as end user connections need to support it as well.

Although Internet providers continue to evolve their service portfolios to offer increased connection speeds and reduced latency in order to support growth in use cases like videoconferencing, live streaming, and online gaming, consumer adoption is often mixed due to cost, availability, or other issues. By aggregating the results of <a href=\"https://speed.cloudflare.com/\"><u>speed.cloudflare.com</u></a> tests taken during 2024, we can get a geographic perspective on <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/glossary/#connection-quality\"><u>connection quality</u></a> metrics including average download and upload speeds, and average idle and loaded latencies, as well as the distribution of the measurements.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-quality\"><u>2024</u></a>, Spain was a leader in download speed (292.6 Mbps) and upload speed (192.6 Mbps) metrics, and placed second globally for loaded latency (78.6 ms). (Loaded latency is the round-trip time when data-heavy applications are being used on the network.) Spain’s leadership in these connection quality metrics is supported by the strong progress that the country has made <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/106695\"><u>towards achieving the EU’s “Digital Decade” objectives</u></a>, including fixed very high capacity network (VHCN) deployment, fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) coverage, and 5G coverage with the latter two <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/spain-digital-economy\"><u>reaching</u></a> 95.2% and 92.3% respectively. High speed fiber broadband connections are also relatively affordable, with research showing major providers offering 100 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 600 Mbps, and 1 Gbps packages, with the latter priced between €30 and €46 per month. The figures below for <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/es#internet-quality\"><u>Spain</u></a> show the largest clusters of speed measurements around the 100 Mbps mark, with slight bumps also visible around 300 Mbps, suggesting that the former package has the highest subscription rate, followed by the latter.

One way we do this is passively measuring rates of connections to Cloudflare that appear <i>anomalous</i>, meaning that they are unexpectedly terminated before any useful data exchange occurs. The underlying causes of connection anomalies are varied and range from DoS attacks to quirky client behavior to third-party connection tampering (e.g., when a network monitors and selectively disrupts connections to filter content).</p><p>Connection anomalies are symptoms — visible signs that “something abnormal” is happening in a network, but the underlying root cause is not always clear from the outset. However, we can gain a better understanding by incorporating previously-reported network behaviors, active measurements and on-the-ground reports, and macro trends across networks. Additional details on such analysis can be found in the blog posts <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/connection-tampering/\"><i><u>A global assessment of third-party connection tampering</u></i></a> and<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tcp-resets-timeouts/\"> <i><u>Bringing insights into TCP resets and timeouts to Cloudflare Radar</u></i></a>.</p><p>Insights into TCP connection anomalies were <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tcp-resets-timeouts/\"><u>launched on Cloudflare Radar</u></a> in September, with the plot lines in the associated graph corresponding to the stage of the TCP connection in which the connection anomalously closed (using shorthand, the first three messages we typically receive from the client in a TCP connection are “SYN” and “ACK” packets to establish a connection, and then a “PSH” packet indicating the requested resource). In aggregate <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#tcp-connection-anomalies\"><u>globally</u></a>, over 20% of connections to Cloudflare were terminated unexpectedly, with the largest share (nearly half) being closed “Post SYN” — that is, after our server has received a client’s SYN packet, but before we have received a subsequent acknowledgement (ACK) from the client or any useful data that would follow the acknowledgement. These terminations can often be attributed to DoS attacks or Internet scanning. Post-ACK (3.1% globally) and Post-PSH (1.4% globally) anomalies are more often associated with connection tampering, especially when they occur at high rates in specific networks.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/11XcEAXkMgOhytTbCsf21J/159fa2459ebc6b9c268bd5d8455213ba/connectivity_-_TCP_connection_anomalies.png\" alt=\"connectivity - TCP connection anomalies\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1575\" height=\"840\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Trends in TCP connection anomalies by stage in 2024</i></sup></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n            <a href=\"#security\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          \n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4CkCPZHGlR8gQQQrXt0b5H/cfd3faabbe406fd348b8751825bc43e5/2627_Shield_Globe.png\" alt=\"2627 Shield Globe\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"417\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"6-5-of-global-traffic-was-mitigated-by-cloudflares-systems-as-being-potentially-malicious-or-for-customer-defined-reasons\">6.5% of global traffic was mitigated by Cloudflare&#39;s systems as being potentially malicious or for customer-defined reasons.</h3>\n            <a href=\"#6-5-of-global-traffic-was-mitigated-by-cloudflares-systems-as-being-potentially-malicious-or-for-customer-defined-reasons\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>To <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/\"><u>protect customers from threats</u></a> posed by malicious bots used to attack websites and applications, Cloudflare mitigates this attack traffic using <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\"><u>DDoS</u></a> mitigation techniques or <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/\"><u>Web Application Firewall (WAF) Managed Rules</u></a>.

BGP, however, relies on trust between networks, and incorrect information shared between peers, whether or not it was shared intentionally, can send traffic to the wrong place, potentially with <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-leaks-and-crypto-currencies/\"><u>malicious results</u></a>. <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/\"><u>Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)</u></a> is a cryptographic method of signing records that associate a BGP route announcement with the correct originating autonomous system (AS) number, providing a way of ensuring that the information being shared originally came from a network that is allowed to do so. (It is important to note that this is only half of the challenge of implementing routing security, because network providers also need to validate these signatures and filter out invalid announcements to prevent sharing them further.)</p><p>Cloudflare has long been an advocate for routing security, including being a founding participant in the <a href=\"https://www.manrs.org/2020/03/new-category-of-cdns-and-cloud-providers-join-manrs-to-improve-routing-security/\"><u>MANRS CDN and Cloud Programme</u></a> and providing a <a href=\"https://isbgpsafeyet.com/\"><u>public tool</u></a> that enables users to test whether their Internet provider has implemented BGP safely.

The latter metric is of interest because a route announcement covering a significant amount of IP address space (millions of IPv4 addresses, for example) has a greater potential impact than an announcement covering a small block of IP address space (hundreds of IPv4 addresses, for example).</p><p>At a <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#routing-security\"><u>global</u></a> level during 2024, we saw a 6.4 percentage point increase (from 43.4% to 49.8%) in valid IPv4 routes, and a 3.2 percentage point increase (from 53.7% to 56.9%) in valid IPv6 routes. Given the trajectory, it is likely that over half of IPv4 routes will be RPKI valid by the end of calendar year 2024. Looking at the global share of IP address space covered by valid routes, we saw a 4.7 percentage point increase (from 38.9% to 43.6%) for IPv4, and a 3.3 percentage point increase (from 57.6% to 60.9%) for IPv6.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2ojjIa2U45vvsbha8v6ITk/2c61631ded62b80481d47e1da8a5d2cc/security_-_routing_global_valid_routes.png\" alt=\"security - routing global valid routes\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1575\" height=\"840\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Shares of global RPKI valid routing entries by IP version in 2024</i></sup></p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2rCCmsaqULazLsBgoXZLLC/9aa265e9658d71bd7ee113423c6945ca/security_-_routing_global_valid_ip_address_space.png\" alt=\"security - routing global valid ip address space\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1575\" height=\"840\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Shares of globally announced IP address space covered by RPKI valid routes in 2024</i></sup></p><p><a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/es#routing-security\"><u>Spain</u></a> started 2024 with less than half of its routes (both IPv4 and IPv6) RPKI valid.

Aggregated at a weekly level, spikes above 14% were seen in late March, early April, and mid-May.

These categories are defined and explored in detail in our <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/2023-phishing-report/\"><u>phishing threats report</u></a>. In our analysis of malicious emails, we have found that such messages may contain multiple types of threats. In reviewing a weekly aggregation of threat activity trends for these categories, we found that, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#top-email-threats\"><u>averaged across 2024</u></a>, 42.9% of malicious email messages contained deceptive links, with the share reaching 70% at times throughout the year. Activity for this thread category was spiky, with low points seen in the March to May timeframe, and a general downward trend visible from July through November.</p><p>Identity deception was a similarly active threat category, with such threats also found in up to 70% of analyzed emails several weeks throughout the year. Averaged across 2024, 35.1% of emails contained attempted identity deception. The activity pattern for this threat category appears to be somewhat similar to deceptive links, with a number of the peaks and valleys occurring during the same weeks. At times, identity deception was a more prevalent threat in analyzed emails than deceptive links, as seen in the graph below.</p><p>Among other threat categories, extortion saw the most significant change throughout the year. After being found in 86% of malicious emails during the first week of January, its share gradually trended lower throughout the year, finishing November under 10%.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/47EGZSEcRbUY67bsnYTSip/81ce3c89beefe1ddbe66f68710366c87/email_-_threat_category.png\" alt=\"email - threat category\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1575\" height=\"840\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Global malicious email threat category trends for Deceptive Links and Identity Deception in 2024</i></sup></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"over-99-of-the-email-messages-processed-by-cloudflare-email-security-from-the-bar-rest-and-uno-top-level-domains-tlds-were-found-to-be-either-spam-or-malicious-in-nature\">Over 99% of the email messages processed by Cloudflare Email Security from the .bar, .rest, and .uno top level domains (TLDs) were found to be either spam or malicious in nature.</h3>\n            <a href=\"#over-99-of-the-email-messages-processed-by-cloudflare-email-security-from-the-bar-rest-and-uno-top-level-domains-tlds-were-found-to-be-either-spam-or-malicious-in-nature\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In March 2024, we <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/email-security-insights-on-cloudflare-radar/\"><u>launched a set of email security insights on Cloudflare Radar</u></a>, including visibility into so-called “dangerous domains” — those top level domains (TLDs) that were found to be the sources of the most spam or malicious email among messages analyzed by Cloudflare Email Security.
