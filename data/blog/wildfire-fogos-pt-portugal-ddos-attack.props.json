During wildfires, the site is where firefighters, journalists, citizens, and even government agencies go to understand what’s happening on the ground. Over the years, fogos.pt has evolved from parsing PDFs into visual maps to a full-featured app and website with historical data, weather overlays, and more. It’s also part of Project Galileo, Cloudflare’s initiative to protect vulnerable but important public interest sites at no cost.</p><p>Wildfires are not just a Portuguese challenge. They are frequent across southern Europe (Spain, Greece, currently also under alert), California, Australia, and in Canada, which in 2023 faced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_wildfires\"><u>record-setting</u></a> fires. In all these cases, reliable information can be crucial, sometimes life-saving. Other organizations offering similar public services can also apply to join <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/\"><u>Project Galileo</u></a> to receive protection and handle heavy traffic.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"a-side-project-that-became-a-national-reference\">A side project that became a national reference</h2>\n      <a href=\"#a-side-project-that-became-a-national-reference\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Fogos.pt began with a simple question: why was fire data only available in hard-to-read PDF documents? João and a group of friends, including volunteer firefighters, decided to build something better. They pulled the data, geolocated the fire reports, and visualized them on a map.</p><p>Soon, thousands of people were using it. Then tens of thousands. Today, fogos.pt is integrated into official communications, including mentions from the Portuguese government on social media and direct links from the national wildfire information portal (<a href=\"https://www.sgifr.gov.pt/\"><u>SGIFR.gov.pt</u></a>).</p><p>In 2018, fogos.pt formally joined forces with<a href=\"https://vost.pt\"><u> VOST Portugal</u></a>, a digital volunteer organization that was early on also part of our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/\"><u>Project Galileo</u></a> — whose<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/vost-portugal/\"><u> story was also featured in an earlier case study</u></a>. João Pina is also a co-founder of VOSTPT. Together, they created a complementary model: fogos.pt provides data and the platform; VOSTPT validates and communicates it to the public in real-time during emergencies.</p><p>It’s an operation run entirely by volunteers, with no funding, no formal team — just passion, and the help of partners.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6NjIxtp7YJjI8IPkDTdVtC/1a14e97700ab05992c1ea0610747d624/BLOG-2934_3.jpg\" alt=\"BLOG-2934 3\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1423\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sub>Homepage of fogos.pt on August 20, 2025, highlighting a major wildfire near Piódão in central Portugal.</sub></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"under-attack-during-fire-season\">Under attack during fire season</h3>\n      <a href=\"#under-attack-during-fire-season\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>On July 31 and August 1, 2025, two Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeted fogos.pt.

But for an civic project like fogos.pt, even tens of thousands of requests per second — if unprotected — can be enough to take services offline at the worst possible time.</p><p>Attackers typically use three main methods for DDoS attacks:</p><ul><li><p>IoT devices: hacked cameras, routers, or smart gadgets sending traffic.</p></li><li><p>Proxies: open or misconfigured servers, residential proxy networks, or anonymity tools that hide attackers’ IPs.</p></li><li><p>Cloud machines: compromised or rented servers from cloud providers.</p></li></ul><p>The July 31 attack likely relied on open proxies, with much of the traffic arriving unencrypted (a common sign of proxy-based attacks). The August 1 attack, in contrast, came largely from cloud machines, matching patterns we see from botnets that exploit cloud infrastructure.</p><p>These attacks were blocked without disruption. Cloudflare’s autonomous mitigation systems kicked in, and email alerts were automatically sent to João and the team. No downtime, no manual intervention required.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-role-of-project-galileo-traffic-surges\">The role of Project Galileo: traffic surges</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-role-of-project-galileo-traffic-surges\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Fogos.pt has used Cloudflare’s free services since the beginning, starting with DNS and gradually expanding to DDoS mitigation, caching, rate limiting, and more.
