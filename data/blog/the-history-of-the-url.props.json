Attendees included <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy\">the guy who would create Sun Microsystems</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Lebling\">the guy who made Zork</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_L._Mills\">the NTP guy</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Fabry\">the guy who convinced the government to pay for Unix</a>. The problem was simple: there were 455 hosts on the ARPANET and the situation was getting out of control.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6WQsRS2vJe3lMfiLeHhd3s/74bce48a7b421b2c9a5d36ee90e67d27/arpanet-1969.gif\" alt=\"arpanet-1969\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"642\" height=\"831\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>This issue was occuring now because the ARPANET was on the verge of <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc801.txt\">switching</a> from its original <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Control_Program\">NCP protocol</a>, to the TCP/IP protocol which powers what we now call the Internet. With that switch suddenly there would be a multitude of interconnected networks (an ‘Inter... net’) requiring a more ‘hierarchical’ domain system where ARPANET could resolve its own domains while the other networks resolved theirs.</p><p>Other networks at the time had great names like “COMSAT”, “CHAOSNET”, “UCLNET” and “INTELPOSTNET” and were maintained by groups of universities and companies all around the US who wanted to be able to communicate, and could afford to lease 56k lines from the phone company and buy the requisite <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11\">PDP-11s</a> to handle routing.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/AUhl6rf41MVuuXzajTXpv/66d2caf12cc9262eb73b541cbe67871f/HOU-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"800\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>In the original ARPANET design, a central Network Information Center (NIC) was responsible for maintaining a file listing every host on the network. The file was known as the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952\"><code>HOSTS.TXT</code></a> file, similar to the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file on a Linux or OS X system today. Every network change would <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc952.txt\">require</a> the NIC to FTP (a protocol invented in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc114\">1971</a>) to every host on the network, a significant load on their infrastructure.</p><p>Having a single file list every host on the Internet would, of course, not scale indefinitely. The priority was email, however, as it was the predominant addressing challenge of the day. Their ultimate conclusion was to create a hierarchical system in which you could query an external system for just the domain or set of domains you needed. In their words: “The conclusion in this area was that the current ‘user@host’ mailbox identifier should be extended to ‘user@host.domain’ where ‘domain’ could be a hierarchy of domains.” And the domain was born.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/635FebLCDpXlTg9jhxUg1J/4a0fcd9caeb15654115ad9d5a934f517/arpanet.gif\" alt=\"arpanet\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1029\" height=\"693\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>It’s important to dispel any illusion that these decisions were made with prescience for the future the domain name would have. In fact, their elected solution was primarily decided because it was the “one causing least difficulty for existing systems.” For example, <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc799.txt\">one proposal</a> was for email addresses to be of the form <code>&lt;user&gt;.&lt;host&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;</code>. If email usernames of the day hadn’t already had ‘.’ characters you might be emailing me at ‘zack.cloudflare@com’ today.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3dGooF27BGHVbjLixUPFTh/59247e63781b79979462d3fb700c3bd5/arpanet-1987.gif\" alt=\"arpanet-1987\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"800\" height=\"546\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"what-is-cloudflare\">What is Cloudflare?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#what-is-cloudflare\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare allows you to move caching, load balancing, rate limiting, and even network firewall and code execution out of your infrastructure to our points of presence within milliseconds of virtually every Internet user.<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=Blog+CTA&utm_content=History+of+URL&utm_term=middle_of_post\">Read A Case Study</a> <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/contact/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=Blog+CTA&utm_content=History+of+URL&utm_term=middle_of_post\">Contact Sales</a></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"uucp-and-the-bang-path\">UUCP and the Bang Path</h3>\n            <a href=\"#uucp-and-the-bang-path\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <blockquote><p>It has been said that the principal function of an operating system is to define a number of different names for the same object, so that it can busy itself keeping track of the relationship between all of the different names.

Clark, <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc814.txt\"><code>1982</code></a></p></blockquote><p>Another <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien116.txt\">failed proposal</a> involved separating domain components with the exclamation mark (<code>!</code>). For example, to connect to the <code>ISIA</code> host on <code>ARPANET</code>, you would connect to <code>!ARPA!ISIA</code>. You could then query for hosts using wildcards, so <code>!ARPA!*</code> would return to you every <code>ARPANET</code> host.</p><p>This method of addressing wasn’t a crazy divergence from the standard, it was an attempt to maintain it. The system of exclamation separated hosts dates to a data transfer tool called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP\">UUCP</a> <a href=\"http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf\">created</a> in 1976. If you’re reading this on an OS X or Linux computer, <code>uucp</code> is likely still installed and available at the terminal.</p><p>ARPANET was introduced in 1969, and quickly became a powerful communication tool... among the handful of universities and government institutions which had access to it. The Internet as we know it wouldn’t become publically available outside of research institutions until <a href=\"http://www.cybertelecom.org/notes/nsfnet.htm\">1991</a>, twenty one years later. But that didn’t mean computer users weren’t communicating.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7mK9fOr1LrYPMsYZdsAAaM/e37630bef46ded748c05387b40ac2abb/coupler.jpg\" alt=\"coupler\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>In the era before the Internet, the general method of communication between computers was with a direct point-to-point dial up connection. For example, if you wanted to send me a file, you would have your modem call my modem, and we would transfer the file. To craft this into a network of sorts, UUCP was born.</p><p>In this system, each computer has a file which lists the hosts its aware of, their phone number, and a username and password on that host. You then craft a ‘path’, from your current machine to your destination, through hosts which each know how to connect to the next:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">sw-hosts!digital-lobby!zack</pre></code>\n            <p>This address would form not just a method of sending me files or connecting with my computer directly, but also would be my email address. In this era before ‘mail servers’, if my computer was off you weren’t sending me an email.</p><p>While use of ARPANET was restricted to top-tier universities, UUCP created a bootleg Internet for the rest of us.

The <code>299</code> is the ‘time to live’, letting us know how many more seconds this value will be valid for, before it should be queried again. But what does the <code>IN</code> mean?</p><p><code>IN</code> stands for ‘Internet’. Like so much of this, the field dates back to an era when there were several competing computer networks which needed to interoperate.

That root is traditionally signified with a single ‘.’. In fact, ending all of your domain names with a ‘.’ is semantically correct, and will absolutely work in your web browser: <a href=\"http://google.com./\"><code>google.com.</code></a></p><p>The first TLD was <code>.arpa</code>. It allowed users to address their old traditional ARPANET hostnames during the transition. For example, if my machine was previously registered as <code>hfnet</code>, my new address would be <code>hfnet.arpa</code>. That was only temporary, during the transition, server administrators had a very important choice to make: which of the five TLDs would they assume? “.com”, “.gov”, “.org”, “.edu” or “.mil”.</p><p>When we say DNS is hierarchical, what we mean is there is a set of root DNS servers which are responsible for, for example, turning <code>.com</code> into the <code>.com</code> nameservers, who will in turn answer how to get to <code>google.com</code>.

The <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035\">original documents</a> which govern domains specify they are to be encoded in ASCII. Every piece of internet hardware from the last forty years, including the <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/routers/crs-1-multishelf-system/model.html\">Cisco</a> and <a href=\"http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/release-independent/junos/information-products/pathway-pages/t-series/t1600/\">Juniper</a> routers used to deliver this page to you make that assumption.</p><p>The web itself was <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1994q3/1085.html\">never ASCII-only</a>. It was actually originally concieved to speak <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1\">ISO 8859-1</a> which includes all of the ASCII characters, but adds an additional set of special characters like ¼ and letters with special marks like ä. It does not, however, contain any non-Latin characters.</p><p>This restriction on HTML was ultimately removed in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2070\">2007</a> and that same year Unicode <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/moving-to-unicode-51.html\">became</a> the most popular character set on the web. But domains were still confined to ASCII.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1blJl7MdG3rkY8t0d6Cpmc/d13686659fe57207808c1a1037e658a2/ie-hebrew.gif\" alt=\"ie-hebrew\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"641\" height=\"474\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>As you might guess, Punycode was not the first proposal to solve this problem. You most likely have heard of UTF-8, which is a popular way of encoding Unicode into bytes (the 8 is for the eight bits in a byte). In the year <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jseng-utf5-01\">2000</a> several members of the Internet Engineering Task Force came up with UTF-5. The idea was to encode Unicode into five bit chunks. You could then map each five bits into a character allowed (A-V &amp; 0-9) in domain names. So if I had a website for Japanese language learning, my site 日本語.com would become the cryptic M5E5M72COA9E.com.</p><p>This encoding method has several disadvantages. For one, A-V and 0-9 are used in the output encoding, meaning if you wanted to actually include one of those characters in your doman, it had to be encoded like everything else. This made for some very long domains, which is a serious problem when each segment of a domain is restricted to 63 characters. A domain in the Myanmar language would be restricted to no more than 15 characters. The proposal does make the very interesting suggestion of using UTF-5 to allow Unicode to be transmitted by Morse code and telegram though.</p><p>There was also the question of how to let clients know that this domain was encoded so they could display them in the appropriate Unicode characters, rather than showing M5E5M72COA9E.com in my address bar. There were <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idn-compare-01\">several suggestions</a>, one of which was to use an unused bit in the DNS response. It was the “last unused bit in the header”, and the DNS folks were “very hesitant to give it up” however.</p><p>Another suggestion was to start every domain using this encoding method with <code>ra--</code>. At <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idn-race-00\">the time</a> (mid-April 2000), there were no domains which happened to start with those particular characters. If I know anything about the Internet, someone registered an <code>ra--</code> domain out of spite immediately after the proposal was published.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492\">ultimate conclusion</a>, reached in 2003, was to adopt a format called Punycode which included a form of delta compression which could dramatically shorten encoded domain names. Delta compression is a particularily good idea because the odds are all of the characters in your domain are in the same general area within Unicode. For example, two characters in Farsi are going to be much closer together than a Farsi character and another in Hindi. To give an example of how this works, if we take the nonsense phrase:</p><p>يذؽ</p><p>In an uncompressed format, that would be stored as the three characters <code>[1620, 1584, 1597]</code> (based on their Unicode code points). To compress this we first sort it numerically (keeping track of where the original characters were): <code>[1584, 1597, 1620]</code>. Then we can store the lowest value (<code>1584</code>), and the delta between that value and the next character (<code>13</code>), and again for the following character (<code>23</code>), which is significantly less to transmit and store.</p><p>Punycode then (very) efficiently encodes those integers into characters allowed in domain names, and inserts an <code>xn--</code> at the beginning to let consumers know this is an encoded domain. You’ll notice that all the Unicode characters end up together at the end of the domain. They don’t just encode their value, they also encode where they should be inserted into the ASCII portion of the domain. To provide an example, the website 熱狗sales.com becomes <code>xn--sales-r65lm0e.com</code>. Anytime you type a Unicode-based domain name into your browser’s address bar, it is encoded in this way.</p><p>This transformation could be transparent, but that introduces a major security problem. All sorts of Unicode characters print identically to existing ASCII characters. For example, you likely can’t see the difference between Cyrillic small letter a (“а”) and Latin small letter a (“a”). If I register Cyrillic аmazon.com (xn--mazon-3ve.com), and manage to trick you into visiting it, it’s gonna be hard to know you’re on the wrong site. For that reason, when you visit <a href=\"http:/??.ws\">??.ws</a>, your browser somewhat lamely shows you <code>xn--vi8hiv.ws</code> in the address bar.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"protocol\">Protocol</h3>\n            <a href=\"#protocol\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The first portion of the URL is the protocol which should be used to access it.

The understanding was your client would parse this information into a usable form which linked the entries with the destination pages.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5UWn6JpG7A4jcCvywWjfia/a04e867d00abda65b3f7b3066fbd45e0/gopher.gif\" alt=\"gopher\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"514\" height=\"451\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>The first popular protocol was FTP, which was created in 1971, as a way of listing and downloading files on remote computers. Gopher was a logical extension of this, in that it provided a similar listing, but included facilities for also reading the metadata about entries. This meant it could be used for more liberal purposes like a news feed or a simple database. It did not have, however, the freedom and simplicity which characterizes HTTP and HTML.</p><p>HTTP is a very simple protocol, particularily when compared to alternatives like FTP or even the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/\">HTTP/3</a> protocol which is rising in popularity today. First off, HTTP is entirely text based, rather than being composed of bespoke binary incantations (which would have made it significantly more efficient). Tim Berners-Lee correctly intuited that using a text-based format would make it easier for generations of programmers to develop and debug HTTP-based applications.</p><p>HTTP also makes almost no assumptions about what you’re transmitting. Despite the fact that it was invented expliticly to accompany the HTML language, it allows you to specify that your content is of any type (using the MIME <code>Content-Type</code>, which was a new invention at the time). The protocol itself is rather simple:</p><p>A request:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com</pre></code>\n            <p>Might respond:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Mon, 23 May 2005 22:38:34 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Encoding: UTF-8\nContent-Length: 138\nLast-Modified: Wed, 08 Jan 2003 23:11:55 GMT\nServer: Apache/1.3.3.7 (Unix) (Red-Hat/Linux)\nETag: &quot;3f80f-1b6-3e1cb03b&quot;\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nConnection: close\n\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;An Example Page&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        Hello World, this is a very simple HTML document.\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>To put this in context, you can think of the networking system the Internet uses as starting with IP, the Internet Protocol. IP is responsible for getting a small packet of data (around 1500 bytes) from one computer to another. On top of that we have TCP, which is responsible for taking larger blocks of data like entire documents and files and sending them via many IP packets reliably. On top of that, we then implement a protocol like HTTP or FTP, which specifies what format should be used to make the data we send via TCP (or UDP, etc.) understandable and meaningful.</p><p>In other words, TCP/IP sends a whole bunch of bytes to another computer, the protocol says what those bytes should be and what they mean.</p><p>You can make your own protocol if you like, assemblying the bytes in your TCP messages however you like. The only requirement is that whoever you are talking to speaks the same language.

Gopher is 70, HTTP 80. The HTTP port was assigned (likely by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel\">Jon Postel</a> at the IANA) at the request of Tim Berners-Lee sometime between <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1060\">1990</a> and <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1340\">1992</a>.</p><p>This concept, of registering ‘port numbers’ predates even the Internet. In the original NCP protocol which powered the ARPANET remote addresses were identified by 40 bits. The first 32 identified the remote host, similar to how an IP address works today. The last eight were known as the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc433\">AEN</a> (it stood for “Another Eight-bit Number”), and were used by the remote machine in the way we use a port number, to separate messages destined for different processes. In other words, the address specifies which machine the message should go to, and the AEN (or port number) tells that remote machine which application should get the message.</p><p>They quickly <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc322\">requested</a> that users register these ‘socket numbers’ to limit potential collisions. When port numbers were expanded to 16 bits by TCP/IP, that registration process was continued.</p><p>While protocols have a default port, it makes sense to allow ports to also be specified manually to allow for local development and the hosting of multiple services on the same machine. That same logic was the <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1992/0335.html\">basis</a> for prefixing websites with <code>www.</code>. At the time, it was unlikely anyone was getting access to the root of their domain, just for hosting an ‘experimental’ website. But if you give users the hostname of your specific machine (<code>dx3.cern.ch</code>), you’re in trouble when you need to replace that machine. By using a common subdomain (<code>www.cern.ch</code>) you can change what it points to as needed.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-bit-in-between\">The Bit In-between</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-bit-in-between\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As you probably know, the URL syntax places a double slash (<code>//</code>) between the protocol and the rest of the URL:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">http://cloudflare.com</pre></code>\n            <p>That double slash was inherited from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo/Domain\">Apollo</a> computer system which was one of the first networked workstations.

Arguing that the current URL system is sufficient is like praising the DOS command line, and stating that most people should simply learn to use command line syntax. The reason we have windowing systems is to make computers easier to use, and more widely used. The same thinking should lead us to a superior way of locating specific sites on the Web.</p><p>— Dale Dougherty <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1996JanFeb/0075.html\"><code><u>1996</u></code></a></p></blockquote><p>There are several different ways to understand the ‘Internet’. One is as a system of computers connected using a computer network. That version of the Internet came into being in 1969 with the creation of the ARPANET. Mail, files and chat all moved over that network before the creation of HTTP, HTML, or the ‘web browser’.</p><p>In 1992 Tim Berners-Lee created three things, giving birth to what <i>we</i> consider the Internet. The HTTP protocol, HTML, and the URL. His goal was to bring ‘Hypertext’ to life. Hypertext at its simplest is the ability to create documents which link to one another. At the time it was viewed more as a science fiction panacea, to be complimented by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia\">Hypermedia</a>, and any other word you could add ‘Hyper’ in front of.</p><p>The key requirement of Hypertext was the ability to link from one document to another. In TBL’s time though, these documents were hosted in a multitude of formats and accessed through protocols like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)\">Gopher</a> and FTP. He needed a consistent way to refer to a file which encoded its protocol, its host on the Internet, and where it existed on that host.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Conferences/IETF92/WWX_BOF_mins.html\">the original</a> World-Wide Web presentation in March of 1992 TBL described it as a ‘Universal Document Identifier’ (UDI). Many <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Protocols/old/osi-ds-29-00.txt\">different formats</a> were considered for this identifier:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">protocol: aftp host: xxx.yyy.edu path: /pub/doc/README\n \nPR=aftp; H=xx.yy.edu; PA=/pub/doc/README;\n \nPR:aftp/xx.yy.edu/pub/doc/README\n \n/aftp/xx.yy.edu/pub/doc/README</pre></code>\n            <p>This document also explains why spaces must be encoded in URLs (%20):</p><p>&gt; The use of white space characters has been avoided in UDIs: spaces\n&gt; are not legal characters.  This was done because of the frequent\n&gt; introduction of extraneous white space when lines are wrapped by\n&gt; systems such as mail, or sheer necessity of narrow column width, and\n&gt; because of the  inter-conversion of various forms of white space\n&gt; which occurs during character code conversion and the transfer of\n&gt; text between applications.</p><p>What’s most important to understand is that the URL was fundamentally just an abbreviated way of refering to the combination of scheme, domain, port, credentials and path which previously had to be understood contextually for each different communication system.</p><p>It was first officially defined in an <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt\">RFC</a> published in 1994.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">scheme:[//[user:password@]host[:port]][/]path[?query][#fragment]</pre></code>\n            <p>This system made it possible to refer to different systems from within Hypertext, but now that virtually all content is hosted over HTTP, may not be as necessary anymore.

It may seem odd to you that queries use the ampersand character (<code>&amp;</code>) which is the same character used in HTML to encode special characters. In fact, if you’ve used HTML for any period of time, you likely have had to encode ampersands in URLs, turning <code>http://host/?x=1&amp;y=2</code> into <code>http://host/?x=1&amp;amp;y=2</code> or <code>http://host?x=1&amp;#38;y=2</code> (that particular confusion has <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1992/0447.html\">always existed</a>).</p><p>You may have also noticed that cookies follow a similar, but different format: <code>x=1;y=2</code> which doesn’t actually conflict with HTML character encoding at all.

It was <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1992NovDec/0042.html\">quickly proposed</a> that perhaps this was too specific, and we really needed a general purpose <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag.</p><p>That particular proposal actually uses plus signs to separate the components of what otherwise looks like a modern GET query:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">http://somehost.somewhere/some/path?x=xxxx+y=yyyy+z=zzzz</pre></code>\n            <p>This was far from universally acclaimed. <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1992NovDec/0032.html\">Some believed</a> we needed a way of saying that the content on the other side of links should be searchable:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">&lt;a HREF=&quot;wais://quake.think.com/INFO&quot; INDEX=1&gt;search&lt;/a&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>Tim Berners-Lee <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1992NovDec/0044.html\">thought</a> we should have a way of defining strongly-typed queries:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">&lt;ISINDEX TYPE=&quot;iana:/www/classes/query/personalinfo&quot;&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>I can be somewhat confident in saying, in retrospect, I am glad the more generic solution won out.</p><p>The real work on <code>&lt;INPUT&gt;</code> <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0079.html\">began</a> in January of 1993 based on an older SGML type. It was (perhaps unfortunately), <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0085.html\">decided</a> that <code>&lt;SELECT&gt;</code> inputs needed a separate, richer, structure:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">&lt;select name=FIELDNAME type=CHOICETYPE [value=VALUE] [help=HELPUDI]&gt; \n    &lt;choice&gt;item 1\n    &lt;choice&gt;item 2\n    &lt;choice&gt;item 3\n&lt;/select&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>If you’re curious, reusing <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, rather than introducing the <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> element was <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0188.html\">absolutely</a> considered. There were, of course, alternative form proposals. <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0168.html\">One</a> included some variable substituion evocative of what Angular might do today:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">&lt;ENTRYBLANK TYPE=int LENGTH=length DEFAULT=default VAR=lval&gt;Prompt&lt;/ENTRYBLANK&gt;\n&lt;QUESTION TYPE=float DEFAULT=default VAR=lval&gt;Prompt&lt;/QUESTION&gt;\n&lt;CHOICE DEFAULT=default VAR=lval&gt;\n    &lt;ALTERNATIVE VAL=value1&gt;Prompt1 ...\n    &lt;ALTERNATIVE VAL=valuen&gt;Promptn\n&lt;/CHOICE&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>In this example the inputs are checked against the type specified in <code>type</code>, and the <code>VAR</code> values are available on the page for use in <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0150.html\">string substitution</a> in URLs, à la:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">http://cloudflare.com/apps/$appId</pre></code>\n            <p>Additional <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0188.html\">proposals</a> actually used <code>@</code>, rather than <code>=</code>, to separate query components:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">name@value+name@(value&amp;value)</pre></code>\n            <p>It was Marc Andreessen who <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q3/0812.html\">suggested</a> our current method based on what he had already implemented in Mosaic:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">name=value&amp;name=value&amp;name=value</pre></code>\n            <p>Just <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q4/0437.html\">two months later</a> Mosaic would add support for <code>method=POST</code> forms, and ‘modern’ HTML forms were born.</p><p>Of course, it was also Marc Andreessen’s company <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19990421025406/http://home.mcom.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html\">Netscape</a> who would create the cookie format (using a different separator). Their proposal was itself painfully shortsighted, led to the attempt to introduce a <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt\"><code>Set-Cookie2</code></a> header, and introduced fundamental structural issues we still deal with at Cloudflare to this day.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"fragments\">Fragments</h3>\n            <a href=\"#fragments\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The portion of the URL following the ‘#’ is known as the fragment. Fragments were a part of URLs since their <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html\">initial specification</a>, used to link to a specific location on the page being loaded. For example, if I have an anchor on my site:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">&lt;a name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>I can link to it:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">http://zack.is/#bio</pre></code>\n            <p>This concept was gradually extended to any element (rather than just anchors), and moved to the <code>id</code> attribute rather than <code>name</code>:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-undefined\"><code class=\"language-undefined\">&lt;h1 id=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;Bio&lt;/h1&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>Tim Berners-Lee decided to use this character based on its connection to addresses in the United States (despite the fact that he’s British by birth). In <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#etc\">his words</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In a snail mail address in the US at least, it is common to use the number sign for an apartment number or suite number within a building. So 12 Acacia Av #12 means “The building at 12 Acacia Av, and then within that the unit known numbered 12”. It seemed to be a natural character for the task. Now, http://www.example.com/foo#bar means “Within resource http://www.example.com/foo, the particular view of it known as bar”.</p></blockquote><p>It turns out that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)\">original Hypertext system</a>, created by Douglas Engelbart, also used the ‘#’ character for the same purpose. This may be coincidental or it could be a case of accidental “idea borrowing”.</p><p>Fragments are explicitly not included in HTTP requests, meaning they only live inside the browser. This concept proved very valuable when it came time to implement client-side navigation (before <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API\">pushState</a> was introduced). Fragments were also very valuable when it came time to think about how we can store state in URLs without actually sending it to the server. What could that mean? Let’s explore:</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"molehills-and-mountains\">Molehills and Mountains</h3>\n            <a href=\"#molehills-and-mountains\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <blockquote><p>There is a whole standard, as yukky as SGML, on Electronic data Intercahnge [sic], meaning forms and form submission. I know no more except it looks like fortran backwards with no spaces.</p><p>— Tim Berners-Lee <a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0091.html\"><code>1993</code></a></p></blockquote><p>There is a popular perception that the internet standards bodies didn’t do much from the finalization of HTTP 1.1 and HTML 4.01 in 2002 to when HTML 5 really got on track. This period is also known (only by me) as the Dark Age of XHTML. The truth is though, the standardization folks were <i>fantastically busy</i>. They were just doing things which ultimately didn’t prove all that valuable.</p><p>One such effort was the Semantic Web. The dream was to create a Resource Description Framework (editorial note: run away from any team which seeks to create a framework), which would allow metadata about content to be universally expressed. For example, rather than creating a nice web page about my Corvette Stingray, I could make an RDF document describing its size, color, and the number of speeding tickets I had gotten while driving it.</p><p>This is, of course, in no way a bad idea. But the format was XML based, and there was a big chicken-and-egg problem between having the entire world documented, and having the browsers do anything useful with that documentation.</p><p>It did however provide a powerful environment for philosophical argument. One of the best such arguments lasted at least ten years, and was known by the masterful codename ‘<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#httpRange-14\">httpRange-14</a>’.</p><p>httpRange-14 sought to answer the fundamental question of what a URL is. Does a URL always refer to a document, or can it refer to anything? Can I have a URL which points to my car?</p><p>They didn’t attempt to answer that question in any satisfying manner. Instead they focused on how and when we can use 303 redirects to point users from links which aren’t documents to ones which are, and when we can use URL fragments (the bit after the ‘#’) to <a href=\"http://blog.iandavis.com/2010/11/a-guide-to-publishing-linked-data-without-redirects/\">point users to linked data</a>.</p><p>To the pragmatic mind of today, this might seem like a silly question. To many of us, you can use a URL for whatever you manage to use it for, and people will use your thing or they won’t. But the Semantic Web cares for nothing more than semantics, so it was on.</p><p>This particular topic was discussed on <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/01-tag-summary#arch-doc\">July 1st 2002</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/15-tag-summary#L3330\">July 15th 2002</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/22-tag-summary#L3974\">July 22nd 2002</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/29-tag-summary#httpRange-14\">July 29th 2002</a>, <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Sep/0127\">September 16th 2002</a>, and at least 20 other occasions through 2005. It was resolved by the great ‘<a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2005Jun/0039.html\">httpRange-14 resolution</a>’ of 2005, then reopened by complaints in <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2007Jul/0034.html\">2007</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-awwsw/2011Jan/0021.html\">2011</a> and <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/uddp/change-proposal-call.html\">a call for new solutions</a> in 2012.

Ultimately, the conclusion is just as true for any project or startup today as it was then: all that matters is adoption. If you can get people to use it, however slipshod it might be, they will help you craft it into what they need. The corollary is, of course, no one is using it, it doesn’t matter how technically sound it might be. There are countless tools which millions of hours of work went into which precisely no one uses today.</p><p>This was adapted from a post which originally appeared on the Eager blog.
