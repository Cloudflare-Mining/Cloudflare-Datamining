In essence, ransomware works by infecting a computer, then encrypting files - preventing users from being able to access them. Users then see a window on their screen demanding payment with the promise of decrypting files. Multiple copycat viruses also sprung up, using the same exploit as WannaCry.</p><p>It is worth noting that even after paying, you&#39;re unlikely to see your files back (don&#39;t expect an honest transaction from criminals).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4lRcjVSkC9AzNgSL3acz7W/9f9db36a007f34dfd1a6e8dc360a62f4/Wana_Decrypt0r_screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>WannaCry was estimated to have infected over 300 000 computers around the world; this included high-profile government agencies and corporations, the UK&#39;s National Health Service was one notable instance of this.</p><p>Despite the wide-ranging impact of this attack, a lot of victims could have protected themselves fairly easily. Security patches had already been available to fix the bug that allowed this attack to happen and installing anti-virus software could have contained the spread of this ransomware.</p><p>For consumers; it is generally a good idea to install updates, particularly security updates. Platforms like Windows XP no longer receive security updates, and therefore shouldn&#39;t be used - regardless of how up-to-date they are on security patches.</p><p>Of course, it is also essential to back-up your most indispensable files, not just because of the damage security vulnerabilities.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"dont-put-your-eggs-in-one-basket\">Don&#39;t put your eggs in one Basket</h3>\n            <a href=\"#dont-put-your-eggs-in-one-basket\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>It may not be Easter, but you certainly should not be putting all your eggs in one basket. For this reason; it is often not a good idea to use the same password across multiple sites.</p><p>Passwords have been around since 1961, however, no alternative has been found which keeps all their benefits; users continue to set passwords weakly, and website developers continue to store them insecurely.</p><p>When developers store computer passwords, they should do so in a way that they can check a computer password is correct but they can never know what the original password is. Unfortunately many websites (including some popular ones) implement internet security poorly. When they get hacked, a password dump can be leaked with everyone&#39;s emails/usernames alongside their passwords.</p><p>If the same email/username and password combination are used on multiple sites, hackers can automatically use the breached user data from one site to attempt logins against other websites you use online.</p><p>For this reason, it&#39;s absolutely critical to use a unique password across multiple sites. Password manager apps like <a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/\">LastPass</a> or <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a> allow you to use unique randomly-generated passwords for each site but manage them from one encrypted wallet using a master password.</p><p>Simple passwords, based on personal information or using individual words in the dictionary, are far from safe too. Computers can repeatedly go through common passwords in order to crack them. Similarly, adding numbers and symbols (i.e. changing <i>password</i> to <i>p4$$w0rd</i>) will do little to help also.</p><p>When you have to choose a password you need to remember, you can create strong passwords from sentences. For example: <i>&quot;At Christmas my dog stole 2 pairs of Doc Martens shoes!&quot;</i> can become <i>ACmds2poDMs!</i> Passwords based on simple sentences can be long, but still easy to remember.</p><p>Another approach is to simply select four random dictionary words, for example: <i>WindySoapLongBoulevard</i>. (For obvious reasons, don&#39;t actually use that as your password.) Although this password uses solely letters, it is more secure than a shorter password that would also use numbers and symbols.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"layering-security\">Layering Security</h3>\n            <a href=\"#layering-security\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Authentication is how computers confirm you are who you say you are.

I describe how this can be done in:<a href=\"/performing-preventing-ssl-stripping-a-plain-english-primer/\">Performing &amp; Preventing SSL Stripping: A Plain-English Primer</a></p><p>It is also often good guidance to be careful about the links you see in emails; they legitimate emails from your bank, or just someone trying to capture your personal information from their fake &quot;phishing&quot; website that looks just like your bank? Just because someone has a little bit of information about you, doesn&#39;t mean they are who they say they are. When in doubt; void following links directly in emails, and check the validity of the email independently (such as by directly going to your banking website).
