	<p>As Workers has matured into a full-stack platform, we’ve introduced more options to facilitate your connectivity to data. With <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv"><u>Workers KV</u></a>, we made it easy to store configuration and cache unstructured data on the edge. With <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/d1"><u>D1</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/durable-objects"><u>Durable Objects</u></a>, we made it possible to build multi-tenant apps with simple, isolated SQL databases. And with Hyperdrive, we made connecting to external databases fast and scalable from Workers.</p>
	<p>Today, we’re introducing a new choice for building on Cloudflare: Postgres and MySQL PlanetScale databases, directly accessible from within the Cloudflare dashboard. Link your Cloudflare and PlanetScale accounts, stop manually copying API keys back-and-forth, and connect Workers to any of your PlanetScale databases (production or otherwise!).</p>

	<p><sup>Connect to a PlanetScale database — no figuring things out on your own</sup></p>
	<p>Postgres and MySQL are the most popular options for building applications, and with good reason. Many large companies have built and scaled on these databases, providing for a robust ecosystem (like Cloudflare!). And you may want to have access to the power, familiarity, and functionality that these databases provide.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Importantly, all of this builds on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/it-it/how-hyperdrive-speeds-up-database-access"><u>Hyperdrive</u></a>, our distributed connection pooler and query caching infrastructure. Hyperdrive keeps connections to your databases warm to avoid incurring latency penalties for every new request, reduces the CPU load on your database by managing a connection pool, and can cache the results of your most frequent queries, removing load from your database altogether. Given that about 80% of queries for a typical transactional database are read-only, this can be substantial — we’ve observed this in reality!</p>

	<p>Starting today, you can <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=%2F%3Aaccount%2Fworkers%2Fhyperdrive%3Fstep%3D1&amp;modal=1"><u>connect to your PlanetScale databases from the Cloudflare dashboard</u></a> in just a few clicks. Connecting is now secure by default with a one-click password rotation option, without needing to copy and manage credentials back and forth. A Hyperdrive configuration will be created for your PlanetScale database, providing you with the optimal setup to start building on Workers.</p>
	<p>And the experience spans both Cloudflare and PlanetScale dashboards: you can also create and view attached Hyperdrive configurations for your databases from the PlanetScale dashboard.</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
		<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3I7WyAGXCLY8xhugPlIhl5/0ec38f0248140a628d805df7bb62dcc3/image2.png" alt="" class="kg-image" width="1408" height="736" loading="lazy">
	</figure>
	<p>By automatically integrating with Hyperdrive, your PlanetScale databases are optimally configured for access from Workers. When you connect your database via Hyperdrive, Hyperdrive’s Placement system automatically determines the location of the database and places its pool of database connections in Cloudflare data centers with the lowest possible latency.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>When one of your Workers connects to your Hyperdrive configuration for your PlanetScale database, Hyperdrive will ensure the fastest access to your database by eliminating the unnecessary roundtrips included in a typical database connection setup. Hyperdrive will resolve connection setup within the Hyperdrive client and use existing connections from the pool to quickly serve your queries. Better yet, Hyperdrive allows you to cache your query results in case you need to scale for high-read workloads.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This is a peek under the hood of how Hyperdrive makes access to PlanetScale as fast as possible. We’ve previously blogged about <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/it-it/how-hyperdrive-speeds-up-database-access"><u>Hyperdrive’s technical underpinnings</u></a> — it’s worth a read. And with this integration with Hyperdrive, you can easily connect to your databases across different Workers applications or environments, without having to reconfigure your credentials. All in all, a perfect match.</p>
