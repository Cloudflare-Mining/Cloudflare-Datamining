These are domains that would be too disruptive for the organization to block outright, but that should still be navigated with extra caution.</p><p>For example, people acquire domains and create new businesses every day. There’s nothing wrong with that - quite the opposite. However, attackers often set up or acquire websites serving legitimate content and, days or weeks later, send a link to intended targets. The emails flow through as benign and the attacker weaponizes the website when emails are already sitting on people’s inboxes. Blocking all emails with links to new websites would cause users to surely miss important communications, and delivering the emails while making links safe to click on is a much better suited approach.</p><p>There is also hosting infrastructure from large cloud providers, such as Microsoft or Google, that prevent crawling and scanning. These are used on our day-to-day business, but attackers may deploy malicious content there. You wouldn’t want to fully block emails with links to Microsoft SharePoint, for example, but it’s certainly safer to use Email Link Isolation on them if they link to outside your organization.</p><p>Attackers are constantly experimenting with new ways of looking legitimate to their targets, and that’s why relying on the early signals that Cloudflare sees makes such a big difference.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"2-rewrite-links-in-emails\">2.

The link is opened with Cloudflare Browser Isolation in a nearby <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">Cloudflare data center</a> (globally within 50 milliseconds of 95% of the Internet-connect population).
