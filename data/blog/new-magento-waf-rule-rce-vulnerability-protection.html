	<p>Today the <a href="https://magento.com/" target="_blank">Magento</a> Security Team created a new ModSecurity rule and added it to our WAF rules to mitigate an important RCE (remote code execution) vulnerability in the Magento web e-commerce platform. Any customer using the WAF needs to click the ON button next to the “CloudFlare Magento” Group in the WAF Settings to enable protection immediately.</p>

CloudFlare WAF protection can help mitigate vulnerabilities like this, but it is vital that Magento users patch Magento immediately.
