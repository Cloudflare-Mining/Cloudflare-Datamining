	<p>Welcome to our DDoS Threat Report for the third quarter of 2022. This report includes insights and trends about the DDoS threat landscape - as observed across Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network">global network</a>.</p>
	<p>Multi-terabit strong DDoS attacks have become increasingly frequent. In Q3, Cloudflare automatically detected and mitigated multiple attacks that exceeded 1 Tbps. The largest attack was a 2.5 Tbps DDoS attack launched by a Mirai botnet variant, aimed at the Minecraft server, Wynncraft, that uses <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-spectrum">Cloudflare Spectrum</a>, a reverse-proxy for TCP/UDP applications. This is the largest attack we’ve ever seen from the bitrate perspective.</p>
	<p>It was a multi-vector attack consisting of UDP and TCP floods. However, Wynncraft, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game">massively multiplayer online role-playing game</a> Minecraft server where hundreds and thousands of users can play on the same server, didn’t even notice the attack, since Cloudflare filtered it out for them.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ransom-ddos-attack">Ransom DDoS attacks</a> are attacks where the attacker demands a ransom payment, usually in the form of Bitcoin, to stop/avoid the attack. In Q3, 15% of Cloudflare customers that responded to our survey reported being targeted by HTTP DDoS attacks accompanied by a threat or a ransom note. This represents a 15% increase QoQ and 67% increase YoY of reported ransom DDoS attacks.</p>

	<p>Distribution of Ransom DDoS attacks by quarter</p>
	<p>Diving into Q3, we can see that since June 2022, there was a steady decline in reports of ransom attacks. However, in September, the reports of ransom attacks spiked again. In the month of September, almost one out of every four respondents reported receiving a ransom DDoS attack or threat — the highest month in 2022 so far.</p>

	<p>Distribution of Ransom DDoS attacks by month</p>
	<p><b>How we calculate Ransom DDoS attack trends</b>Our systems constantly analyze traffic and automatically apply mitigation when DDoS attacks are detected. Each DDoS'd customer is prompted with an automated survey to help us better understand the nature of the attack and the success of the mitigation. For over two years, Cloudflare has been surveying attacked customers. One of the questions in the survey asks the respondents if they received a threat or a ransom note demanding payment in exchange to stop the DDoS attack. Over the past year, on average, we collected 174 responses per quarter. The responses of this survey are used to calculate the percentage of Ransom DDoS attacks.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/application-layer-ddos-attack">Application-layer DDoS attacks</a>, specifically HTTP DDoS attacks, are attacks that usually aim to disrupt a web server by making it unable to process legitimate user requests. If a server is bombarded with more requests than it can process, the server will drop legitimate requests and - in some cases - crash, resulting in degraded performance or an outage for legitimate users.</p>

	<p>Top countries targeted by HTTP DDoS attacks in 2022 Q3</p>
	<p>When we zoom in on specific countries, we can identify the below trends that may reveal interesting insights regarding the war in Ukraine and geopolitical events in East Asia:</p>
	<p><b>In Ukraine,</b> we see a surprising change in the attacked industries. Over the past two quarters, Broadcasting, Online Media and Publishing companies were targeted the most in what appeared to be an attempt to silence information and make it unavailable to civilians. However, this quarter, those industries dropped out of the top 10 list. Instead, the Marketing &amp; Advertising industry took the lead (40%), followed by Education companies (20%), and Government Administration (8%).</p>
	<p><b>In Russia</b>, attacks on the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) industry continue to persist (25%). Be that as it may, attacks on the BFSI sector still decreased by 44% QoQ. In second place is the Events Services industry (20%), followed by Cryptocurrency (16%), Broadcast Media (13%), and Retail (11%). A significant portion of the attack traffic came from Germany-based IP addresses, and the rest were globally distributed.</p>
	<p><b>In Taiwan,</b> the two most attacked industries were Online Media (50%) and Internet (23%). Attacks to those industries were globally distributed indicating the usage of botnets.</p>
	<p><b>In Japan,</b> the most attacked industry was Internet/Media &amp; Internet (52%), Business Services (12%), and Government - National (11%).</p>

	<p>Before digging into specific source country metrics, it is important to note that while country of origin is interesting, it is not necessarily indicative of where the attacker is located. Oftentimes with DDoS attacks, they are launched remotely, and attackers will go to great lengths to hide their actual location in an attempt to avoid being caught. If anything, it is indicative of where botnet nodes are located. With that being said, by mapping the attacking IP address to their location, we can understand where attack traffic is coming from.</p>
	<p>After two consecutive quarters, China replaced the US as the main source of HTTP DDoS attack traffic. In Q3, China was the largest source of HTTP DDoS attack traffic. Attack traffic from China-registered IP addresses increased by 29% YoY and 19% QoQ. Following China was India as the second-largest source of HTTP DDoS attack traffic — an increase of 61% YoY. After India, the main sources were the US and Brazil.</p>
	<p>Looking at Ukraine, we can see that this quarter there was a drop in attack traffic originating from Ukrainian and Russian IP addresses — a decrease of 29% and 11% QoQ, respectively. However, YoY, attack traffic from within those countries still increased by 47% and 18%, respectively.</p>
	<p>Another interesting data point is that attack traffic originating from Japanese IP addresses increased by 130% YoY.</p>

	<p>Top attack vectors in 2022 Q3</p>
	<p>Last quarter, <a href="https://classic.radar.cloudflare.com/notebooks/ddos-2022-q2#emerging-threats">we saw a resurgence</a> of attacks abusing the CHARGEN protocol, the Ubiquity Discovery Protocol, and Memcached reflection attacks. While the growth in Memcached DDoS attacks also slightly grew (48%), this quarter, there was a more dramatic increase in attacks abusing the BitTorrent protocol (1,221%), as well as attacks launched by the Mirai botnet and its variants.</p>
	<p><b>BitTorrent DDoS attacks increased by 1,221% QoQ</b>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent protocol</a> is a communication protocol that’s used for peer to peer file sharing. To help the BitTorrent clients find and download the files efficiently, BitTorrent clients may use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker">BitTorrent Trackers</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">Distributed Hash Tables (DHT)</a> to identify the peers that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_BitTorrent_terms#Seed_/_seeding">seeding</a> the desired file. This concept can be abused to launch DDoS attacks. A malicious actor can <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing">spoof</a> the victim’s IP address as a seeder IP address within Trackers and DHT systems. Then clients would request the files from those IPs. Given a sufficient number of clients requesting the file, it can flood the victim with more traffic than it can handle.</p>
	<p><b>Mirai DDoS attacks increased by 405% QoQ</b><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet">Mirai</a> is <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/malware">malware</a> that infects smart devices that run on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC_(processor)">ARC processors</a>, turning them into a network of bots that can be used to launch DDoS attacks. This processor runs a stripped-down version of the Linux operating system. If the default username-and-password combo is not changed, Mirai is able to log in to the device, infect it, and take over. The botnet operator can instruct the botnet to launch a flood of UDP packets at the victim’s IP address to bombard them.</p>

	<p>While Terabit-strong attacks are becoming more frequent, they are still the outliers. The majority of attacks are tiny (in terms of Cloudflare scale). Over 95% of attacks peaked below 50,000 packets per second (pps) and over 97% below 500 Megabits per second (Mbps). We call this “cyber vandalism”.</p>
	<p>What is cyber vandalism? As opposed to “classic” vandalism where the purpose is to cause deliberate destruction of or damage to public or private <i>physical</i> property — such as graffiti on the side of a building — in the cyberworld, cyber vandalism is the act of causing deliberate damage to Internet properties. Today the source codes for various botnets are available online and there are a number of free tools that can be used to launch a flood of packets. By directing those tools to Internet properties, any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie"><i>script-kid</i></a> can use those tools to launch attacks against their school during exam season or any other website they desire to take down or disrupt. This is as opposed to organized crime, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Persistent_Threat">Advanced Persistent Threat</a> actors, and state-level actors that can launch much larger and sophisticated attacks.</p>

	<p>Similarly, most of the attacks are very short and end within 20 minutes (94%). This quarter we did see an increase of 9% in attacks of 1-3 hours, and a 3% increase in attacks over 3 hours — but those are still the outliers.</p>

	<p>Even with the largest attacks, such as the 2.5 Tbps attack we mitigated earlier this quarter, and the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/26m-rps-ddos">26M request per second attack</a> we mitigated back in the summer, the peak of the attacks were short-lived. The entire 2.5 Tbps attack lasted about 2 minutes, and the peak of the 26M rps attack only 15 seconds. This emphasizes the need for automated, always-on solutions. Security teams can’t respond quick enough. By the time the security engineer looks at the PagerDuty notification on their phone, the attack has subsided.</p>

	<p>Attacks may be initiated by humans, but they are executed by bots — and to play to win, you must fight bots with bots. Detection and mitigation must be automated as much as possible, because relying solely on humans puts defenders at a disadvantage. Cloudflare’s automated systems constantly detect and mitigate DDoS attacks for our customers, so they don’t have to.</p>
	<p>Over the years, it has become easier, cheaper, and more accessible for attackers and attackers-for-hire to launch DDoS attacks. But as easy as it has become for the attackers, we want to make sure that it is even easier - and free - for defenders of organizations of all sizes to protect themselves against DDoS attacks of all types. We've been providing <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unmetered-mitigation">unmetered and unlimited DDoS protection</a> for free to all of our customers since 2017 — when we pioneered the concept.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare's mission is to help build a better Internet. A better Internet is one that is more secure, faster, and reliable for everyone - even in the face of DDoS attacks.</p>
