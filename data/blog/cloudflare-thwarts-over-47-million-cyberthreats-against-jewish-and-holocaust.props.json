This tragic chapter in human history serves as a stark reminder of the catastrophic consequences of prejudice and extremism. </p><p>The United Nations General Assembly designated January 27 — the anniversary of the liberation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp\"><u>Auschwitz-Birkenau</u></a> —  as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. This year, we commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of this infamous extermination camp.</p><p>As the world reflects on this dark period, a troubling resurgence of antisemitism underscores the importance of vigilance. This growing hatred has spilled into the digital realm, with cyberattacks increasingly targeting Jewish and Holocaust remembrance and educational websites — spaces dedicated to preserving historical truth and fostering awareness.</p><p>For this reason, here at Cloudflare, we began to publish annual reports covering cyberattacks that target these organizations. These cyberattacks include <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\"><u>DDoS attacks</u></a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/\"><u>bot</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/what-is-web-application-security/\"><u>application attacks</u></a>.
