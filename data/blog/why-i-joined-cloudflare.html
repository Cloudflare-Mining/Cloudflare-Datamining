	<p>Customer Service. Business. Growth. While these three make up a large portion of what keeps most enterprise companies operating, they are just the beginning at Cloudflare.</p>
	<p>I am excited to share that I have joined Cloudflare as its Chief Customer Officer. Cloudflare has seen explosive growth: we launched only a decade ago and have already amassed nearly 3 million customers and grown from a few 100 enterprise customers to 1000s. Currently, we are at a growth inflection point where more companies are choosing to partner with us and are leveraging our service. We are fortunate to serve these customers with a consistent, high quality experience, no matter where their end-users are located around the world.</p>

For the past several years, I have worked primarily in networking and security companies like Palo Alto Networks, RedLock Security and CipherCloud, overseeing customer success and all post-sales activities.

I enjoy working with customers and focusing on delivering value through the use of technology and services.</p>
