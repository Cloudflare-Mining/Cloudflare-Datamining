The hardware ecosystem was simple – Intel had consistently delivered industry leading processors. Other vendors could not compete with them on both performance and cost. Recently it all changed: AMD has been challenging the status quo with their 2nd Gen EPYC processors.</p><p>This is not the first time that Intel has been challenged; previously <a href=\"/arm-takes-wing/\">there was Qualcomm</a>, and we worked with AMD and considered their 1st Gen EPYC processors and based on the original Zen architecture, but ultimately, <a href=\"/a-tour-inside-cloudflares-g9-servers/\">Intel prevailed</a>. AMD did not give up and unveiled their 2nd Gen EPYC processors codenamed Rome based on the latest Zen 2 architecture.</p><blockquote><p>Playing with some new fun kit. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/epyc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#epyc</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1No8Cmfzwl\">pic.twitter.com/1No8Cmfzwl</a></p><p>— Matthew Prince ?

Improvements include a die shrink from 14nm to 7nm, a doubling of the top end core count from 32 to 64, and a larger L3 cache size. Let’s emphasize again on the size of that L3 cache, which is 32 MiB L3 cache per Core Complex Die (CCD).</p><p>This time around, we have taken steps to understand our workloads at the hardware level through the use of hardware performance counters and profiling tools. Using these specialized CPU registers and profilers, we collected data on the AMD 2nd Gen EPYC and Intel Skylake-based Xeon processors in a lab environment, then validated our observations in production against other generations of servers from the past.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"simulated-environment\">Simulated Environment</h2>\n      <a href=\"#simulated-environment\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>CPU Specifications</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/42MpuiHDcFmNWT8c5GOh96/3666d84667b56b645e29aec5cfafdfdd/image-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1242\" height=\"452\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We evaluated several Intel Cascade Lake and AMD 2nd Gen EPYC processors, trading off various factors between power and performance; the AMD EPYC 7642 CPU came out on top.

On the other hand, the 2nd Gen EPYC processors start at 4 MiB per core. The AMD EPYC 7642 is a unique SKU since it has 256 MiB of L3 cache.
