During the first quarter of 2024, similar outages were observed on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Paltelco/status/1745813735627727091\">January 12</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Paltelco/status/1749464176756449631\">January 22</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/QudsNen/status/1765100306353017128\">March 5</a>. Paltel attributes these outages to the ongoing aggression related to the war with Israel.</p><p>The associated outages during the quarter varied in length, from just a few hours to over a week. Each outage is shown in the graphs below, which show Paltel traffic within four Palestinian governorates in the Gaza Strip region. While it appears that the Gaza governorate suffered a disruption to traffic as connectivity remained available, complete outages occurred in the Khan Yunis, Rafah, and Deir al-Balah governorates.</p><p><b>January 12-19</b></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:100%;\">\n    <table class=\"ck-table-resized\" style=\"border:1px solid hsl(0, 0%,

Historically, the exchange of BGP routing information was based on trust between providers, but over time, security mechanisms such as <a href=\"/rpki/\">Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)</a> have been developed to prevent abuse of the system by bad actors. RPKI is a cryptographic method of signing records that associate a BGP route announcement with the correct originating AS number. ROA (Route Origin Authorization) records provide a means of verifying that an IP address block holder has authorized an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/\">AS (Autonomous System)</a> to originate routes to that one or more prefixes within the address block. Cloudflare has <a href=\"/tag/rpki\">published a number of blog posts</a> over the years about the importance of, and our support for, RPKI. Properly implemented and configured, RPKI and ROAs help support routing security, effectively preventing behavior like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/bgp-hijacking/\">BGP hijacking</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ripe.net/\">RIPE NCC</a> (“RIPE”) is one of five <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry\">Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)</a> that provides Internet resource allocation and registration, and coordination activities. RIPE’s region covers Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia. On January 3, a malicious actor took advantage of lax account security on the part of RIPE and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as12479\">AS12479 (Orange España)</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/rpki-signed-but-not-secure\">used credentials found on the public Internet</a> to log into Orange España’s RIPE account. Once in control of the account, the attacker published multiple ROAs with “bogus” origins, rendering thousands of routes originated by AS12479 “RPKI-invalid”, which <a href=\"https://www.kentik.com/blog/digging-into-the-orange-espana-hack/\">resulted in carriers that reject RPKI-invalid routes to stop carrying a large amount of Orange España’s IP space</a>.</p><p>Because Cloudflare enforces RPKI validation, we also rejected the RPKI-invalid routes. We would have started trying to reach Orange España over our default route toward some of our transit providers, but because they also perform RPKI validation, traffic would have been dropped within those provider networks as well. Because of this, from Cloudflare’s perspective, this incident caused a drop in traffic from Orange España between 16:45 and 19:45 local time (14:45 - 17:45 UTC) as well as a <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as12479?dateStart=2024-01-03&dateEnd=2024-01-03\">notable drop in announced IPv4 address space from AS12479</a>.</p><p>Orange España <a href=\"https://twitter.com/orange_es/status/1742616775647265035\">confirmed on social media</a> that its RIPE account had been improperly accessed, and as a result of the incident, <a href=\"https://www.ripe.net/publications/news/mandatory-2fa-on-ripe-ncc-access-accounts/\">RIPE has made two-factor authentication (2FA) mandatory</a> for logins.

Because subscribers were unable to successfully resolve hostnames using Plusnet’s default DNS resolvers, this ultimately manifested itself as a drop in traffic from the network for approximately two hours, between 16:00 and 18:00 local time (and UTC). Users that had configured their systems to use a third-party DNS resolver, such as <a href=\"https://one.one.one.one/dns/\">Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 service</a>, did not experience a service disruption.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3 id=\"russia\">Russia</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>DNS issues also impacted users in Russia during January, though in a different way than Plusnet subscribers in the UK experienced.

(DNSSEC creates a secure domain name system by adding cryptographic signatures to existing DNS records.

At peak, 68.4% of requests received SERVFAIL responses. The Coordination Center for the .ru ccTLD <a href=\"https://t.me/fontankaspb/51445\">confirmed</a> that it was working on the “technical problem affecting the .ru zone associated with the global DNSSEC infrastructure” but didn’t provide any additional details around the root cause of the problem, such as a potential issue with a DNSSEC key rollover.

Given the <a href=\"https://blog.telegeography.com/2023-mythbusting-part-3\">reliance on submarine cables for carrying Internet traffic</a>, this will continue to be an issue for many years to come.</p><p>The Orange España incident also shed light on the importance of securing operationally important resources with <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/\">multi-factor authentication</a>, a topic that Cloudflare has <a href=\"/how-cloudflare-implemented-fido2-and-zero-trust\">written about in the past</a>. Organizations like RIPE play a critically important behind-the-scenes role in functioning of the Internet, arguably obligating them to take all practical precautions when it comes to securing their systems in order to prevent malicious actors from taking actions that could broadly disrupt Internet connectivity.</p><p>The Cloudflare Radar team is constantly monitoring for Internet disruptions, sharing our observations on the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center\">Cloudflare Radar Outage Center</a>, via social media, and in posts on <a href=\"/tag/cloudflare-radar/\">blog.cloudflare.com</a>.
