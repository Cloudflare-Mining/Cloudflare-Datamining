Depending on what your particular worker is accomplishing, you either want it to fail open or failed closed. Failing open means that if something goes horribly wrong, the original request will be passed through as if your worker did not exist, while failing closed means that a request that raises an exception in your worker will not be processed further.</p><p>If you are editing metadata, collecting metrics, or adding new non-critical HTTP headers, to name a few examples, you probably don&#39;t want an unhandled exception in your worker to prevent the request from being serviced.</p><p>In this case, you can leverage <b>event.passThroughOnException</b> as we have above, and it&#39;s recommended that you call this method in the first line of your fetch event handler. This sets a flag that the Cloudflare worker request handler can inspect in case of an exception to determine the desired passthrough behavior.</p><p>On the other hand, if you&#39;re employing your worker in a security-centric role, tasking it with blocking malicious requests from nefarious bots, or blocking access to sensitive endpoints when valid security credentials are not supplied, you may want your worker to fail closed. This is the default behavior, and it will prevent requests that raise exceptions in your worker from being processed further.</p><p>Our services are in the critical path for our customers, yet our use case was to conditionally add a new HTTP header, so we knew we wanted to fail open.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"having-your-worker-generate-pagerduty-and-hipchat-alerts\">Having your worker generate PagerDuty and Hipchat alerts</h3>\n      <a href=\"#having-your-worker-generate-pagerduty-and-hipchat-alerts\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Now that you&#39;ve done the work to get data from your worker logged to Sentry, you can leverage Sentry&#39;s PagerDuty integration to configure alerts for exceptions that occur in your workers.</p><p>This will increase your team&#39;s confidence in your worker-based solutions, and alert you immediately to any new issues that occur in production.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"share-your-worker-recipes\">Share your worker recipes</h3>\n      <a href=\"#share-your-worker-recipes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>You can find additional worker recipes and examples in our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about/\">official documentation</a>.</p><p>Have you written a worker that you&#39;d like to share? <a href=\"mailto:community@cloudflare.com\">Send it to us</a> and you might get featured on our blog or added to our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/recipes/a-b-testing/\">Cloudflare worker recipe collection</a> with a credit.</p>",
