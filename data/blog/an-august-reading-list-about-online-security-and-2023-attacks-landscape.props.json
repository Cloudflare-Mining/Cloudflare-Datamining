Attacks have gotten more sophisticated, while conflicts (online and offline, and at the same time) continue, including in <a href=\"/one-year-of-war-in-ukraine/\">Ukraine</a>. Governments have heightened their cyber warnings and put together strategies, including around critical infrastructure (including health and education). All of this, at a time when there were never so many online risks, but also people online — over five billion in July 2023, <a href=\"https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-july-global-statshot\">64.5%</a> of the now <a href=\"https://population.un.org/dataportal/data/indicators/49/locations/900/start/1950/end/2100/line/linetimeplotsingle\">eight billion</a> that are the world’s total population.</p><p>Here we take a look at what we’ve been discussing in 2023, so far, in our Cloudflare blog related to attacks and online security in general, with several August reading list suggestions. From new trends, products, initiatives or partnerships, including <a href=\"/tag/ai/\">AI</a> service safety, to <a href=\"/cloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack/\">record-breaking blocked cyberattacks</a>. On that note, our AI hub (<a href=\"https://ai.cloudflare.com/\">ai.cloudflare.com</a>) was just launched.</p><p>Throughout the year, Cloudflare has continued to onboard customers while they were <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/under-attack-hotline/\">being attacked</a>, and we have provided protection to many others, including once.net, responsible for the <a href=\"/how-cloudflare-scaled-and-protected-eurovision-2023-voting/\">2023 Eurovision Song Contest online voting system</a> — the European event reached 162 million people.</p><p>Our global network — a.k.a. <a href=\"/welcome-to-the-supercloud-and-developer-week-2022/\">Supercloud</a> — gives us a unique vantage point. Cloudflare’s extensive scale also helps enhance security, with preventive services powered by machine learning, like our recent <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/\">WAF</a> attack scoring system to <a href=\"/stop-attacks-before-they-are-known-making-the-cloudflare-waf-smarter/\">stop attacks before they become known</a> or even <a href=\"/waf-content-scanning/\">malware</a>.</p><p>Recently, we announced our presence in more than <a href=\"/cloudflare-connected-in-over-300-cities/\">300 cities across over 100 countries</a>, with interconnections to over 12,000 networks and still growing. We provide services for around 20% of websites online and to millions of Internet properties.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"attacks-increasing-a-readiness-and-trust-game\">Attacks increasing.

There are all sorts of attacks, but they have been, generally speaking, increasing. In Q2 2023, Cloudflare blocked an average of <b>140 billion</b> cyber threats per day. One year ago, when we wrote a <a href=\"/2022-attacks-an-august-reading-list-to-go-shields-up/\">similar blog post</a>, it was 124 billion, a 13% increase year over year. Attackers are not holding back, with more sophisticated attacks rising, and sectors such as education or healthcare as the target.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/\">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, like machine learning, is not new, but it has been trending in 2023, and certain capabilities are more generally available. This has raised concerns about the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-being-used-hacking-misinfo-top-canadian-cyber-official-says-2023-07-20/\">quality of deception</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-hacking-bruce-schneier/\">AI hackers</a>.</p><p>This year, governments have also continued to release reports and warnings. In 2022, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) created the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up\">Shields Up</a> initiative in response to Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. In March 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration released the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf\">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a> aimed at securing the Internet.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-cyber-strategy-2022/national-cyber-security-strategy-2022\">UK’s Cyber Strategy</a> was launched at the end of 2022, and in March of this year, a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-strategy-to-protect-nhs-from-cyber-attacks\">strategy</a> was released to specifically protect its National Health Service (NHS) from cyber attacks — in May it was time for the UK’s <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/uk-military-security-by-design/\">Ministry of Defence to do the same</a>. In Germany, the new <a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/digital-strategy/2551972\">Digital Strategy</a> is from 2022, but the <a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/themen/-/2601730\">Security Strategy</a> arrived in June.

The topic of post-quantum cryptography, designed to be secure against the threat of quantum computers, is quite interesting and worth some <a href=\"/tag/post-quantum/\">delving into</a>, but even without knowing what it is, it’s good to know that protection is already here.</p><p>If you want to try some security features mentioned, the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/securitycenter/\">Cloudflare Security Center</a> is a good place to start (free plans included).
