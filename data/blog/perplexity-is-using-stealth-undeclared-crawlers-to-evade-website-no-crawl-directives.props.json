Although Perplexity initially crawls from their declared user agent, when they are presented with a network block, they appear to obscure their crawling identity in an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences. We see continued evidence that Perplexity is repeatedly modifying their user agent and changing their source <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/\"><u>ASNs</u></a> to hide their crawling activity, as well as ignoring — or sometimes failing to even fetch — <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-robots-txt/\"><u>robots.txt</u> </a>files.</p><p>The Internet as we have known it for the past three decades is <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/content-independence-day-no-ai-crawl-without-compensation/\"><u>rapidly changing</u></a>, but one thing remains constant: it is built on trust. There are clear preferences that crawlers should be transparent, serve a clear purpose, perform a specific activity, and, most importantly, follow website directives and preferences. Based on Perplexity’s observed behavior, which is incompatible with those preferences, we have de-listed them as a verified bot and added heuristics to our managed rules that block this stealth crawling.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-we-tested\">How we tested</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-we-tested\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We received complaints from customers who had both disallowed Perplexity crawling activity in their <code>robots.txt</code> files and also created WAF rules to specifically block both of Perplexity’s <a href=\"https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots\"><u>declared crawlers</u></a>: <code>PerplexityBot</code> and <code>Perplexity-User</code>. These customers told us that Perplexity was still able to access their content even when they saw its bots successfully blocked. We confirmed that Perplexity’s crawlers were in fact being blocked on the specific pages in question, and then performed several targeted tests to confirm what exact behavior we could observe.</p><p>We created multiple brand-new domains, similar to <code>testexample.com</code> and <code>secretexample.com</code>.

In addition to rotating IPs, we observed requests coming from different ASNs in attempts to further evade website blocks.

All well-intentioned crawlers acting in good faith should:</p><p><b>Be transparent</b>. Identify themselves honestly, using a unique user-agent, a declared list of IP ranges or <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/web-bot-auth/\"><u>Web Bot Auth</u></a> integration, and provide contact information if something goes wrong.</p><p><b>Be well-behaved netizens</b>. Don’t flood sites with excessive traffic, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-data-scraping/\"><u>scrape</u></a> sensitive data, or use stealth tactics to try and dodge detection.</p><p><b>Serve a clear purpose</b>. Whether it’s powering a voice assistant, checking product prices, or making a website more accessible, every bot has a reason to be there. The purpose should be clearly and precisely defined and easy for site owners to look up publicly.</p><p><b>Separate bots for separate activities</b>. Perform each activity from a unique bot. This makes it easy for site owners to decide which activities they want to allow. Don’t force site owners to make an all-or-nothing decision. </p><p><b>Follow the rules</b>. That means checking for and respecting website signals like <code>robots.txt</code>, staying within rate limits, and never bypassing security protections.</p><p>More details are outlined in our official <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/policy/\"><u>Verified Bots Policy Developer Docs</u></a>.</p><p>OpenAI is an example of a leading AI company that follows these best practices. They clearly <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots\"><u>outline their crawlers</u> and </a>give detailed explanations for each crawler’s purpose. They respect robots.txt and do not try to evade either a robots.txt directive or a network level block. And <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/\"><u>ChatGPT Agent</u></a> is signing http requests using the newly proposed open standard <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/web-bot-auth/\"><u>Web Bot Auth</u></a>.</p><p>When we ran the same test as outlined above with ChatGPT, we found that ChatGPT-User fetched the robots file and stopped crawling when it was disallowed. We did not observe follow-up crawls from any other user agents or third party bots. When we removed the disallow directive from the robots entry, but presented ChatGPT with a block page, they again stopped crawling, and we saw no additional crawl attempts from other user agents. Both of these demonstrate the appropriate response to website owner preferences.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/HMJjS7DRmu4octZ99HX8K/753966a88476f80d7a981b1c135fd251/BLOG-2879_-_6.png\" alt=\"BLOG-2879 - 6\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"265\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-can-you-protect-yourself\">How can you protect yourself?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-can-you-protect-yourself\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>All the undeclared crawling activity that we observed from Perplexity’s hidden User Agent was scored by our bot management system as a bot and was unable to pass managed challenges.
