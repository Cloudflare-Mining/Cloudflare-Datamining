This made it hard to use different versions of Wrangler across projects. Further, it was hard to install on some CI systems because of lack of access to a user&#39;s root folder.  Sometimes, folks would forget to add the <code>@cloudflare</code> scope when installing, confusing them when a completely unrelated package was installed and didn&#39;t work as expected.</p><p>Let&#39;s fix that. We&#39;ve simplified this by now publishing to the <code>wrangler</code> package, so you can run <code>npm install wrangler</code> and it works as expected. You can also install it locally to a project&#39;s <code>package.json</code>, like any other regular npm package. It also works across a much broader range of CPU architectures and operating systems, so you can use it on more machines.</p><p>This makes it a lot more convenient when starting.

We heard feedback from many of you who would get frustrated during this step, and how it would take many minutes before you could get to developing a simple Worker.</p><p>Let&#39;s fix that. You no longer need to create a configuration file when starting, and none of the fields are mandatory. Wrangler infers details about your account and project as you start developing, and you can add configuration incrementally when you need to.</p><p>In fact, you don&#39;t even need to install Wrangler to start! You can create a Worker (say, as <code>index.js</code>) and use <code>npx</code> (a utility that comes installed with <code>node.js</code>) to fetch Wrangler from the npm registry and start developing immediately!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 65.85365853658537%;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframe.videodelivery.net/17180d41b7d1046f77076a661db97912?preload=true&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fvideodelivery.net%2F17180d41b7d1046f77076a661db97912%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D16s%26height%3D600\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\" allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This is great for extremely simple Workers, but why stop there?</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"3-wrangler-init-my-worker-y-one-liner-to-set-up-a-full-project\">3. <code>wrangler init my-worker -y</code>, one liner to set up a full project:</h3>\n      <a href=\"#3-wrangler-init-my-worker-y-one-liner-to-set-up-a-full-project\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We noticed users would struggle to set up a project with Wrangler, even after they&#39;d installed Wrangler and configured <code>wrangler.toml</code>.

This is great for making sure the code you develop will behave the same in development, and after you deploy it to production. The trade-off here is it&#39;s harder to develop code when you have a bad Internet connection, or if you&#39;re running tests on a CI machine. It&#39;s also marginally slower to iterate while coding. Users have asked us for a long time to be able to &#39;run&#39; their code locally on their machines, so that they can iterate quickly and run tests in environments like CI.</p><p>Wrangler now lets you develop on your machine by simply calling <code>wrangler dev --local</code>, and no additional configuration. This is powered by <a href=\"https://miniflare.dev\">Miniflare</a>, a fully featured simulator of the Cloudflare Workers runtime.

However, getting started with debugging was still a bit cumbersome, because you would have to start Wrangler with an <code>--inspect</code> flag, then open a special page in your browser (<code>chrome://inspect</code>), configuring it to detect Wrangler running on a special port, and then launching the debugger. This would also mean you might have lost any debugging messages that were logged before you opened the Chrome developer tools.</p><p>We fixed this. Now you don&#39;t need to pass any special flags when starting up. You can simply hit the <code>D</code> hotkey when developing and a developer tools instance pops up in your browser. And by buffering the messages before you even start up the devtools, you don&#39;t lose any logs or errors! You can also use VS Code developer tools to directly hook into your Worker&#39;s debugging session!</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"8-a-modern-module-system\">8.

Previously, Wrangler required that you set up <code>webpack</code> or a custom build with bundlers (like <code>rollup</code>, <code>vite</code>, or <code>esbuild</code>, to name a few) to consume libraries and modules. This introduces a lot of friction, especially when starting a new project and trying out new ideas.</p><p>Now, support for npm modules comes out of the box, with no extra configuration required! You can install any package from the <a href=\"http://npmjs.com/\">npm registry</a>, organize your own code with modules, and it all works as expected. We&#39;re also introducing an experimental <code>node.js</code> compatibility mode for using <code>node.js</code> modules that wouldn&#39;t previously work without setting up your own polyfills! This means you can use popular frameworks and libraries that you&#39;re already familiar with while focusing on delivering value to your users.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"9-closes-many-outstanding-issues\">9.
