You can write Workers with a language you likely already know. Cloudflare built Workers to execute JavaScript and WebAssembly and has continuously added support for new <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/languages/\">languages</a>.</p><p>The Workers you’ll use for processing emails are just regular Workers that listen to incoming events, implement some logic, and reply accordingly. You can use all the features that a normal Worker would.</p><p>The main difference being that instead of:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">export default {\n  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {\n    handleRequest(request);\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>You&#39;ll have:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">export default {\n  async email(message, env, ctx) {\n    handleEmail(message);\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>The new `email` event will provide you with the &quot;from&quot;, &quot;to&quot; fields, the full headers, and the raw body of the message. You can then use them in any way that fits your use case, including calling other APIs and orchestrating complex decision workflows. In the end, you can decide what action to take, including rejecting or forwarding the email to one of your Email Routing destination addresses.</p><p>With these capabilities you can easily create logic that, for example, only accepts messages coming from one specific address and, when one matches the criteria, forwards to one or more of your verified destination addresses while also immediately alerting you on Slack. Code for such feature could be as simple as this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">export default {\n   async email(message, env, ctx) {\n       switch (message.to) {\n           case &quot;marketing@example.com&quot;:\n               await fetch(&quot;https://webhook.slack/notification&quot;, {\n                   body: `Got a marketing email from ${ message.from }, subject: ${ message.headers.get(&quot;subject&quot;) }`,\n               });\n               sendEmail(message, [\n                   &quot;marketing@corp&quot;,\n                   &quot;sales@corp&quot;,\n               ]);\n               break;\n\n           default:\n               message.reject(&quot;Unknown address&quot;);\n       }\n   },\n};</pre></code>\n            <p>Route to Workers enables everyone to programmatically process their emails and use them as triggers for any other action. We think this is pretty powerful.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"process-up-to-100-000-emails-day-for-free\">Process up to 100,000 emails/day for free</h3>\n            <a href=\"#process-up-to-100-000-emails-day-for-free\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The first 100,000 Worker requests (or Email Triggers) each day are free, and paid plans start at just $5 per 10 million requests.
