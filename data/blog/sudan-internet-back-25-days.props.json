This happened after 25 days of an almost complete shutdown that affected the whole country. It’s a simple line going up on a chart for us, but for a country that also meant that Internet access was (at least in part) back on with all of what comes with it for businesses, communities, families and society as a whole.</p><p>You can see that trend on <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/sd?date_filter=last_7_days\">Cloudflare Radar</a>, in particular after 13:00 UTC (15:00 local time). After that Internet traffic went up like we haven’t seen at all in the previous three weeks.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7IbVMIcZrjIwUoJC67Xxa0/10ba546a242f3816c127187413fa7876/image3-33.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1564\" height=\"850\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1lc7RoTkqhjCD2obpnX1cC/65fbef32e8fa28ac51c94bd9797d969a/image5-11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Internet access was mostly cut off on <a href=\"/sudan-woke-up-without-internet/\">October 25, 2021</a>, after a political turmoil in the country.

The biggest Internet access shutdown in recent history in the country was back in 2019 — for a full 36 days.</p><p>Looking back at the last 30 days <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/sd\">Cloudflare Radar</a> shows very distinctively a big difference from what was previously normal in the country.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2jjMhaTOu4tZ6RpK4mdmn6/6177c35206187c597a787fd229685fb9/image1-61.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>On Wednesday, November 17, (around 11:00 UTC) we saw a further drop in traffic getting Internet traffic in the country close to zero.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5C7Y8LKp5lbIAtijL3v5jQ/3b1fefa1bba5361adf58eb0a999e6c4c/image8-10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1570\" height=\"696\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Now our data shows that the Internet in Sudan picked up firstly thanks to two ISPs, Mobitel and MTN.
