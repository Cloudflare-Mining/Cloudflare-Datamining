Creators and viewers alike enjoy being able to make a “clip” of these moments to share across multiple channels. Being able to generate that clip rapidly enables our customers to offer instant replays, showcase key pieces of recordings, and build audiences on social media in real-time.</p><p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/\">Cloudflare Stream</a> is launching Live Instant Clipping in open beta for all customers. With the new Live Clipping API, you can let your viewers instantly clip and share moments from an ongoing stream - without re-encoding the video.</p><p>When planning this feature, we considered a typical user flow for generating clips from live events. Consider users watching a stream of a video game: something wild happens and users want to save and share a clip of it to social media. What will they do?</p><p>First, they’ll need to be able to review the preceding few minutes of the broadcast, so they know what to clip. Next, they need to select a start time and clip duration or end time, possibly as a visualization on a timeline or by scrubbing the video player. Finally, the clip must be available quickly in a way that can be replayed or shared across multiple platforms, even after the original broadcast has ended.</p><p>That ideal user flow implies some heavy lifting in the background. We now offer a manifest to preview recent live content in a rolling window, and we provide the timing information in that response to determine the start and end times of the requested clip relative to the whole broadcast. Finally, on request, we will generate on-the-fly that clip as a standalone video file for easy sharing as well as an HLS manifest for embedding into players.</p><p>Live Instant Clipping is available in beta to all customers starting today! Live clips are free to make; they do not count toward storage quotas, and playback is billed just like minutes of video delivered. To get started, check out the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/stream-live/live-instant-clipping/\">Live Clipping API in developer documentation</a>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"integrate-cloudflare-images-into-your-application-with-only-a-few-lines-of-code\">Integrate Cloudflare Images into your application with only a few lines of code</h3>\n      <a href=\"#integrate-cloudflare-images-into-your-application-with-only-a-few-lines-of-code\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Building applications with user-uploaded images is even easier with the upload widget, a pre-built, interactive UI that lets users upload images directly into your Cloudflare Images account.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1MVN5ibd1UGnokaEm7f1Vq/8efedb285ec93d52867d78ca63cb454b/image3-9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"988\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Many developers use <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/cloudflare-images/\">Cloudflare Images</a> as an end-to-end image management solution to support applications that center around user-generated content, from AI photo editors to social media platforms.

With face cropping for Cloudflare Images, you can now crop and resize images of people’s faces at scale. For example, if you’re building a social media application, you can apply automatic face cropping to generate profile picture thumbnails from user-uploaded images.</p><p>Our existing gravity parameter uses saliency detection to set the focal point of an image based on the most visually interesting pixels, which determines how the image will be cropped. We expanded this feature by using a machine learning model called RetinaFace, which classifies images that have human faces. We’re also introducing a new zoom parameter that you can combine with face cropping to specify how closely an image should be cropped toward the face.</p><p>To apply face cropping to your image optimization, <a href=\"https://forms.gle/2bPbuijRoqGi6Qn36\">sign up for our closed beta</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6JFNk182dDZHu0sxIySMC5/d3821e2f911b7e31bb411addcc10bdb6/image2-10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"956\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Photo by</i> <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@eyeforebony?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\"><i>Eye for Ebony</i></a> <i>on</i> <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/photo-of-woman-wearing-purple-lipstick-and-black-crew-neck-shirt-vYpbBtkDhNE?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\"><i>Unsplash</i></a></p>\n            <pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\">https://example.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=crop,width=500,height=500,gravity=face,zoom=0.6/https://example.com/images/picture.jpg</pre></code>\n            \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"meet-the-media-team-over-discord\">Meet the Media team over Discord</h3>\n      <a href=\"#meet-the-media-team-over-discord\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>As we’re working to build the next set of media tools, we’d love to hear what you’re building for your users.
