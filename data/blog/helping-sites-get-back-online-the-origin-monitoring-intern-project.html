	<p>The most impactful internship experiences involve building something meaningful from scratch and learning along the way. Those can be tough goals to accomplish during a short summer internship, but our experience with Cloudflare’s 2019 intern program met both of them and more! Over the course of ten weeks, our team of three interns (two engineering, one product management) went from a problem statement to a new feature, which is still working in production for all Cloudflare customers.</p>

	<p>Cloudflare sits between customers’ origin servers and end users. This means that all traffic to the origin server runs through Cloudflare, so we know when something goes wrong with a server and sometimes reflect that status back to users. For example, if an origin is refusing connections and there’s no cached version of the site available, Cloudflare will display a <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003011431-Troubleshooting-Cloudflare-5XX-errors#521error">521 error</a>. If customers don’t have monitoring systems configured to detect and notify them when failures like this occur, their websites may go down silently, and they may hear about the issue for the first time from angry users.</p>

	<p>When a customer’s origin server is unreachable, Cloudflare sends a 5xx error back to the visitor.‌‌</p>
	<p>This problem became the starting point for our summer internship project: since Cloudflare knows when customers' origins are down, let’s send them a notification when it happens so they can take action to get their sites back online and reduce the impact to their users! This work became Cloudflare’s <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037465932-Preventing-site-downtime#5Y1o5Sk9v44PGWnjnfvgh">passive origin monitoring</a> feature, which is currently available on all Cloudflare plans.</p>

	<p>Working with data from all requests going through Cloudflare’s 26 million+ Internet properties to look for unreachable origins is unrealistic from a data volume and performance perspective. Figuring out what datasets were available to analyze for the errors we were looking for, and how to adapt our whiteboarded algorithm ideas to use this data, was a challenge in itself.</p>

	<p>Because only a fraction of requests show up in the sampled timing and error dataset we chose to use, false positives/negatives were disproportionately likely to occur for low-traffic sites. These are the sites that are least likely to have sophisticated monitoring systems in place (and therefore are most in need of this feature!). In order to make the notifications as accurate and actionable as possible, we analyzed patterns of failed requests throughout different types of Cloudflare Internet properties. We used this data to determine thresholds that would maximize the number of true positive notifications, while making sure they weren’t so sensitive that we end up spamming customers with emails about sporadic failures.</p>

	<p>Cloudflare has lots of different kinds of customers, from people running personal blogs with interest in DDoS mitigation to large enterprise companies with extremely sophisticated monitoring systems and global teams dedicated to incident response. We wanted to make sure that our notifications were understandable and actionable for people with varying technical backgrounds, so we enabled the feature for small samples of customers and tested many variations of the “origin monitoring email”. Customers responded right back to our notification emails, sent in support questions, and posted on our community forums. These were all great sources of feedback that helped us improve the message’s clarity and actionability.</p>
	<p>We frontloaded our internship with lots of research (both digging into request data to understand patterns in origin unreachability problems and talking to customers/poring over support tickets about origin unreachability) and then spent the next few weeks iterating. We enabled passive origin monitoring for all customers with some time remaining before the end of our internships, so we could spend time improving the supportability of our product, documenting our design decisions, and working with the team that would be taking ownership of the project.</p>
	<p>We were also able to develop some smaller internal capabilities that built on the work we’d done for the customer-facing feature, like notifications on origin outage events for larger sites to help our account teams provide proactive support to customers. It was super rewarding to see our work in production, helping Cloudflare users get their sites back online faster after receiving origin monitoring notifications.</p>
