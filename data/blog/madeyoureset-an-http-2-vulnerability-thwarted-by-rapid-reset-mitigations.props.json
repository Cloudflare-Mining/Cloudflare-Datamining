		"html": "<p><i><sub>(Correction on August 19, 2025: This post was updated to correct and clarify details about the vulnerability and the HTTP/2 protocol.)</sub></i></p><p>On August 13, security researchers at Tel Aviv University disclosed a new HTTP/2 denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability that they are calling MadeYouReset (<a href=\"https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/767506\"><u>CVE-2025-8671</u></a>). This vulnerability exists in a limited number of unpatched HTTP/2 server implementations that do not accurately track use of server-sent stream resets, which can lead to resource consumption. <b>If you’re using Cloudflare for HTTP DDoS mitigation, you’re already protected from MadeYouReset</b>.</p><p>Cloudflare was informed of this vulnerability in May through a coordinated disclosure process, and we were able to confirm that our systems were not susceptible. We foresaw this sort of attack while mitigating the &quot;<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-recent-http-2-dos-attacks/\"><u>Netflix vulnerabilities</u></a>&quot; in 2019, and added even stronger defenses in response to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/\"><u>Rapid Reset</u></a> (<a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-44487\"><u>CVE-2023-44487</u></a>) in 2023. MadeYouReset and Rapid Reset are two conceptually similar attacks that exploit a fundamental feature within <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113#RST_STREAM\"><u>the HTTP/2 specification</u></a> (RFC 9113): stream resets. In the HTTP/2 protocol, a client initiates a bidirectional stream that carries an HTTP request/response exchange, represented as frames sent between the client and server. Typically, HEADERS and DATA frames are used for a complete exchange.  Endpoints can use the RST_STREAM frame to prematurely terminate a stream, essentially cancelling operations and signalling that it won’t process any more request or response data. Furthermore, HTTP/2 requires that RST_STREAM is sent when there are protocol errors related to the stream. For example, <a href=\"http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113#section-6.1-10\"><u>section 6.1 of RFC 9113</u></a> requires that when a DATA frame is received under the wrong circumstances, &quot;...<i>the recipient MUST respond with a stream error (</i><a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113#section-5.4.2\"><i><u>Section 5.4.2</u></i></a><i>) of type STREAM_CLOSED</i>&quot;. </p><p>The vulnerability exploited by both MadeYouReset and Rapid Reset lies in the potential for malicious actors to abuse this stream reset mechanism. By repeatedly causing stream resets, attackers can overwhelm a server&#39;s resources. While the server is attempting to process and respond to a multitude of requests, the rapid succession of resets forces it to expend computational effort on starting and then immediately discarding these operations. This can lead to resource exhaustion and impact the availability of the targeted server for legitimate users; <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/#impact-on-customers\"><u>as described previously</u></a>, the main difference between the two attacks is that Rapid Reset exploits client-sent resets, while MadeYouReset exploits server-sent resets. It works by using a client to persuade a server into resetting streams via intentionally sending frames that trigger protocol violations, which in turn trigger stream errors.</p><p>RFC 9113 details a number of <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113#section-10.5\"><u>denial-of-service considerations</u></a>. Fundamentally, the protocol provides many features with legitimate uses that can be exploited by attackers with nefarious intent. Implementations are advised to harden themselves: &quot;An endpoint that doesn&#39;t monitor use of these features exposes itself to a risk of denial of service. Implementations SHOULD track the use of these features and set limits on their use.&quot;</p><p>Fortunately, the MadeYouReset vulnerability only impacts a relatively small number of HTTP/2 implementations. In most major HTTP/2 implementations already in widespread use today, the proactive measures taken to implement RFC 9113 guidance and counter Rapid Reset in 2023 have also provided substantial protection against MadeYouReset, limiting its potential impact and preventing a similarly disruptive event.</p><blockquote><p><b>A note about Cloudflare’s Pingora and its users:\n</b>Our <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/pingora-open-source/\"><u>open-sourced Pingora framework</u></a> uses the popular Rust-language h2 library for its HTTP/2 support. Versions of h2 prior to 0.4.11 were <a href=\"https://seanmonstar.com/blog/hyper-http2-didnt-madeyoureset/\"><u>potentially susceptible to MadeYouReset</u></a>. Users of Pingora can patch their applications by updating their h2 crate version using the cargo update command. Pingora does not itself terminate inbound HTTP connections to Cloudflare’s network, meaning this vulnerability could not be exploited against Cloudflare’s infrastructure.</p></blockquote><p>We would like to credit researchers <a href=\"https://galbarnahum.com/posts/made-you-reset-intro\"><u>Gal Bar Nahum</u></a>, Anat Bremler-Barr, and Yaniv Harel of Tel Aviv University for discovering this vulnerability and thank them for their leadership in the coordinated disclosure process. Cloudflare always encourages security researchers to submit vulnerabilities like this to our <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/cloudflare?type=team\"><u>HackerOne Bug Bounty program</u></a>.</p>",
