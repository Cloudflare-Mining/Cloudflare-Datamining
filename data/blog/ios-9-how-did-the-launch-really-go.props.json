		"html": "<p>On September 16 2015 at 10:00AM PST, Apple released their latest update to the iPhone: iOS 9. For several days after the announcement, ISPs and customers reported problems downloading iOS 9 due to overloaded servers. Obviously, the demand for iOS 9 was higher than even Apple anticipated, but how much higher? Few organizations outside of Apple have any idea what the actual iOS 9 adoption rates look like.</p><p>By analyzing the user agent strings of requests passing through the CloudFlare network, we were able to piece together a pretty good picture of iOS 9 uptake. Here’s an hour-by-hour look at requests from iOS 8 devices (blue) and iOS 9 devices (orange) for the first 24 hours after the announcement.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2evKuvfY86P7afmY5e1I1/01dfafd7398d70dc5a6ab689f5ca9042/image_0-1.jpg\" alt=\"iOS 9 vs iOS 8 traffic during official launch\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"900\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We started seeing small amounts of iOS 9 usage <i>before</i> it was officially released, followed by a spike immediately after the launch (times are shown in UTC, so the 10:00AM announcement shows up as hour 18). You can also see a second spike at 10:00 UTC when Europe started waking up.</p><h3>What about iOS 9.1?</h3><p>Even though the official release was for iOS 9.0, we also found beta iOS 9.1 in the wild. Curious about the comparative traffic between the two?</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6k72S5uVWVMg9eFUOPbRE/d04cb5e20562ad2c54c67fe83c97ba8a/image_1.jpg\" alt=\"iOS 9.1 beta traffic during launch\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"900\" height=\"525\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>iOS 9.0 is shown in blue, while 9.1 is shown in orange. As you can see, 9.0 adoption exploded after Apple’s official launch, while the 9.1 beta requests remained steady.</p><h3>Current Adoption Rates</h3><p>Fast-forward five days, and it’s clear that iOS 9 adoption didn’t slow down after the launch. As of September 21st, the relative traffic of iOS 9 (orange) to iOS 8 (blue) on the CloudFlare network is around 30-35%.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7mPQ7f7gXseuluOTyxNdIa/29482c0ee5c18b9ce22a4e085507b20e/image_2-2.png\" alt=\"current iOS9 adoption rate\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"900\" height=\"207\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>IPv6 and iOS 9</h3><p>A key part of the iOS 9 announcement was that all iOS apps running on 9.0+ will require IPv6 support. The IPv4 address space is nearly exhausted, and switching to IPv6 is the only way to keep adding more devices to the global Internet.</p><p>iOS 9’s IPv6 requirement compliments CloudFlare’s mission to make a better Internet. We’ve been doing our part to encourage IPv6 adoption by providing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ipv6\">free IPv6 support</a> to all web properties on our network.</p><p>Although it’s still pretty early, we can already see an uptick in IPv6 requests due to iOS 9:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/CUgWWvcpZYinzb6e4h4ds/5e5557f7195d25fd3f68693d8c08fc3d/image_3.png\" alt=\"iOS 9 vs iOS 8 IPv6 traffic\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"900\" height=\"493\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The first chart shows the number of IPv4 vs. IPv6 requests for iOS 8, while the second shows iOS 9. Even after only a few days, we’re seeing a 1.07% increase in IPv6 requests thanks to iOS 9.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Seeing over 5% of global Internet requests gives us an interesting perspective on current events. We get to watch the worldwide impact of everything from product launches like iOS 9 to hiccups in the Internet infrastructure like the <a href=\"/the-internet-is-a-cooperative-system-dns-outage-of-6-july-2015/\">Dyn outage</a> of last July and even <a href=\"/how-syria-turned-off-the-internet/\">governments turning off the Internet</a>. We try our best to use our unique vantage point to better the Internet as a whole and raise awareness for critical technologies like IPv6.</p>",
