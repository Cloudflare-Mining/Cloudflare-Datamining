Yesterday, December 9, 2021, when a serious vulnerability in the popular Java-based logging package <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html\">Log4j</a> was publicly disclosed, our security teams jumped into action to help respond to the first question and answer the second question. This post explores the second.</p><p>We cover the details of how this vulnerability works in a separate blog post: <a href=\"/inside-the-log4j2-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/\">Inside the Log4j2 vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228)</a>, but in summary, this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code on a remote server. Because of the widespread use of Java and Log4j, this is likely one of the most serious vulnerabilities on the Internet since both <a href=\"/searching-for-the-prime-suspect-how-heartbleed-leaked-private-keys/\">Heartbleed</a> and <a href=\"/inside-shellshock/\">ShellShock</a>. The vulnerability is listed as <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228\">CVE-2021-44228</a>. The CVE description states that the vulnerability affects Log4j2 &lt;=2.14.1 and is patched in 2.15. The vulnerability additionally <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126\">impacts all versions of log4j 1.x</a>; however, it is End of Life and has other security vulnerabilities that will not be fixed. Upgrading to 2.15 is the recommended action to take.

But in this case that was much harder. Log4j is a widely used piece of software but not one that people who are not Java developers are likely to be familiar with. Our first action was to refamiliarize ourselves with all places in our infrastructure where we were running software on the JVM, in order to determine which software components could be vulnerable to this issue.</p><p>We were able to create an inventory of all software we have running on the JVM using our centralized code repositories. We used this information to research and determine each individual Java application we had, whether it contained Log4j, and which version of Log4j was compiled into it.</p><p>We discovered that our ElasticSearch, LogStash, and Bitbucket contained instances of the vulnerable Log4j package that was between versions 2.0 and 2.14.1. We were able to use the mitigation strategies described in the official Log4j security documentation to patch the issue. For each instance of Log4j we either removed the JndiLookup class from the classpath:</p><p><code>zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class</code></p><p>Or we set the mitigating system property in the log4j configuration:</p><p><code>log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups</code></p><p>We were able to quickly mitigate this issue in these packages using these strategies while waiting for new versions of the packages to be released.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"reviewing-external-reports\">Reviewing External Reports</h3>\n      <a href=\"#reviewing-external-reports\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Even before we were done making the list of internal places where the vulnerable software was running, we started by looking at external reports - from HackerOne, our bug bounty program, and a public post in GitHub suggesting that we might be at risk.</p><p>We identified at least two reports that seemed to indicate that Cloudflare was vulnerable and compromised. In one of the reports was the following screenshot:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2qkLHVM69u2bAYEKAWf0UV/34d05486738526729369652f219e4aeb/65876613-4802-4014-B265-A28C1B807847.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1155\" height=\"532\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This example is targeting our developer documentation hosted at <a href=\"https://developer.cloudflare.com/\">https://developer.cloudflare.com</a>. On the right-hand side, the attacker demonstrates that a DNS query was received for the payload he sent to our server. However, the IP address flagged here is <code>173.194.95.134</code>, a member of a Google owned IPv4 subnet (<code>173.194.94.0/23</code>).</p><p>Cloudflareâ€™s developer documentation is hosted as a Cloudflare Worker and only serves static assets. The repository is <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs\">public</a>. The Worker relies on Googleâ€™s analytics library as seen <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/blob/production/developers.cloudflare.com/workers-site/index.js#L48\">here</a>, therefore, we hypothesize that the attacker was not receiving a request from Cloudflare but through Google&#39;s servers.</p><p>Our backend servers receive logging from Workers, but exploitation was also not possible in this instance as we leverage robust Kubernetes egress policies that prevent calling out to the Internet. The only communication allowed is to a curated set of internal services.</p><p>When we received a similar report in our vulnerability disclosure program while gathering more information, the researcher was unable to reproduce the issue. This further enforced our hypothesis that it was third party servers, and they may have patched the issue.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"was-cloudflare-compromised\">Was Cloudflare compromised?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#was-cloudflare-compromised\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>While we were running versions of the software as described above, thanks to our speed of response and defense in depth approach, we do not believe Cloudflare was compromised.

As noted above, we leverage Kubernetes network policies to restrict egress to the Internet on our deployments. In this context, it prevents the next-stage of the attack, and the network connection to attacker controlled resources is dropped.</p><p>All of our externally facing services are protected by Cloudflare. The origin servers for these services are set up via authenticated origin pulls. This means that none of the servers are exposed directly to the Internet.</p><p>2. Â  Using Cloudflare to secure Cloudflare</p><p>All of our internal services are protected by our Zero-trust product, Cloudflare Access. Therefore, once we had patched the limited <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-an-attack-surface/\">attack surface</a> we had identified, any exploit attempts to Cloudflareâ€™s systems or customers leveraging Access would have required the attacker to authenticate.</p><p>And because we have the Cloudflare WAF product deployed as part of our effort to secure Cloudflare using Cloudflare, we benefited from all the work being done to protect our customers. All new WAF rules written to protect against this vulnerability were updated with a default action of <code>BLOCK</code>. Like every other customer who has the WAF deployed, we are now receiving protection without any action required on our side.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n      <a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>While our response to this challenging situation continues, we hope that this outline of our efforts helps others.
