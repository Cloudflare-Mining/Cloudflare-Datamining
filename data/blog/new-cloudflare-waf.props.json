That is 650k blocked HTTP requests per second. The original code that filters this traffic was written by Cloudflare’s now CTO and the WAF has since received many accolades including the highest score for ability to execute in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAF.</p><p>Because we value replacing code when it is no longer as maintainable, performant, or scalable as it once was, we regularly rewrite key parts of the Cloudflare stack. That’s necessary as our enormous growth makes yesterday’s solutions unworkable. For some time, we have been working on replacing that original <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlt4XKhucS4\">LuaJIT code John wrote</a> with new code, written in Rust, along with an improved UI.</p><p>We are now excited to announce a new Cloudflare Web Application Firewall.</p><p>Starting today, 10% of newly created accounts on Cloudflare will be given access to the new WAF whenever a Pro plan zone or above is added. This percentage will increase to 100% of new accounts over the month of April, after which migration efforts will commence for existing customers. Enterprise customers may migrate early by contacting their account team.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"whats-changing\">What’s changing</h3>\n      <a href=\"#whats-changing\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">The Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a> is a core component of the Cloudflare platform. As one of the most used products in the portfolio, we have gained a lot of feedback and experience from running it at scale, that helped guide us in this major iteration. The new WAF brings:</p><ul><li><p><i><b>Better rule browsing and configuration</b></i> - easy one click deploy without losing the power tools: advanced filtering, bulk editing, rule tags and more. Turning on all WordPress rules, setting all Cloudflare Managed Rules to LOG or figuring out which rules are not running is now easy.</p></li><li><p><i><b>A new matching engine</b></i> - written in Rust and supporting the <a href=\"/how-we-made-firewall-rules/\">wirefilter</a> syntax - the same syntax used by custom Firewall Rules. This engine will allow us to have faster managed rule deployments and the ability to scale to the next level by allowing the WAF to be deployed on even more traffic. All while improving performance and security.</p></li><li><p><i><b>Updated Rulesets</b></i> -__ the new WAF ships with updated rulesets that provide better control separating rule status from action. The Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset has also been improved based on the latest version of the OWASP Core Ruleset (v3.3 at time of writing), which adds paranoia levels and improves false positives rates compared to the current version available.</p></li><li><p><i><b>Global configuration</b></i> <b><i>-</i></b> deploy the same configuration across your entire account. Group rules as rulesets and make use of native versioning and rollback capabilities.</p></li></ul><p>The list above is only a small subset of the things we are excited about and each point deserves its own post, but here are the highlights.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"better-rule-browsing-and-configuration\">Better rule browsing and configuration</h3>\n      <a href=\"#better-rule-browsing-and-configuration\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Cloudflare Managed Ruleset, which includes the Cloudflare Specials<sup>1</sup> group, is one of the main components of the WAF. It has several hundred rules that are provided and maintained by Cloudflare. In its default configuration we aim to achieve a very low false positive rate, while providing a very good security baseline for any web application. For the best possible security stance though, you should enable as many rules as possible. This means that, sometimes it’s necessary to deep dive and customise the ruleset behaviour based on the underlying application.</p><p>With the new WAF, we wanted to make sure enabling the Managed Ruleset was a one click effort with the default configuration, while allowing a much better configuration experience for those interested.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/HtlOoLLd8T4mIM5odeQ20/5aff0d8c01df1ccc834c276833bd523b/image8-5.png\" alt=\"The new WAF UI.

For example: <i>show me all rules that are off</i> or <i>show me all rules mitigating XSS attacks</i>. Now, all rules are displayed in a single table - but filtering by rule status, action and tag is one click away. Rule tags are also replacing groups, and a rule may have one or more tags, making the system a lot more flexible. Tags will be used for:</p><ul><li><p>Identifying if a rule is applicable to a specific software component</p></li><li><p>Identifying the attack vector (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/cross-site-scripting/\">XSS</a>, SQLi, RCE)</p></li><li><p>Identifying rules that are CVE specific</p></li></ul><p>Finally, we are allowing for bulk editing controls in addition to inline single rule controls to allow for faster configuration changes based on specific use cases.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/WBKkzAO9JYUGzADTkAbIb/4746b903219f03a0750d58f539148ae6/image3-43.png\" alt=\"The new WAF ruleset browser.

Custom Firewall Rules themselves will soon be migrated onto the new engine, allowing for customers to also create their own custom firewall rulesets, and deploy them as needed on any traffic filter.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"a-new-platform-for-new-features\">A new platform for new features</h3>\n      <a href=\"#a-new-platform-for-new-features\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>There is a lot more to the WAF than meets the eye and the team is already busy finalising a set of additional features built on the new WAF — these include improvements to the engine itself, better analytics and visibility into actionable events.
