Enterprises can no longer build a simple castle-and-moat around their data. Users now connect from any location on the planet to applications that live in environments outside that enterprise’s control.</p><p>We have talked to hundreds of customers who have resorted to applying stopgap measures to try and maintain that castle-and-moat model in some form, but each of those band-aids slow down their users or drive up costs - or both. Almost all the short-term options available combine point solutions that ultimately force traffic to back haul through a central location.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3GoiSxQihfFMmceYtVmL0p/db7d2b668aaa8494f31d5f5e07c81906/Announcing-Cloudflare-s-Data-Loss-Prevention-platform-OG-blog-body-1.png\" alt=\"Announcing Cloudflare’s Data Loss Prevention platform\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1309\" height=\"757\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Part of <a href=\"/cloudflare-one/\">Cloudflare One</a>, Cloudflare’s approach to data loss prevention relies on the same infrastructure and global network that accelerates user traffic to the Internet to also perform inline inspection against all traffic regardless of how it arrives on our network.</p><p>We also know that enterprises need more than just scanning traffic for data strings. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/\">Keeping data safe</a> also requires having visibility into how it moves and being able to control who can reach it.

All of a company’s services lived in a private data center. Users connected from managed office networks or virtual private network (VPN) clients. Security teams could monitor every request because everything took place inside a corporate network that resembled a castle-and-moat.</p><p>When users left offices and applications shifted away from the data center, organizations lost visibility into the connections to sensitive data. Organizations who wanted to adopt an “assume breach” model struggled to determine what kind of data loss could even occur, so they threw every possible solution at the problem.</p><p>We talk to enterprises who purchase new scanning and filtering services, delivered in virtual appliances, for problems they are unsure they have. These deployments force users to back haul all traffic to the Internet, slowing down the experience for every team member, in an attempt to rebuild the visibility offered in that castle-and-moat model.</p><p>Over the last year, we launched the first phase of Cloudflare’s DLP solution to help teams solve that problem. You can now use Cloudflare’s network to capture and log every <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/\">DNS query</a>, request, and file upload or download in your organization. Rather than slowing down your team, these features can accelerate how they can connect to both internally-managed and SaaS applications.</p><p>Building that level of visibility should not become a headache for administrators, either. Cloudflare’s DNS filter can be deployed to office networks and roaming devices in less than an hour. We built the DNS filtering solution on the same technology that powers 1.1.1.1, the world’s fastest DNS resolver, to accelerate end user experience too.</p><p>Next, teams can add context to all the traffic leaving their endpoints and devices by layering on Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/\">Secure Web Gateway</a> platform. Like the DNS filter and 1.1.1.1, we built our Gateway product after spending years improving a consumer equivalent, Cloudflare WARP.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2YQlauYlu7H6o5FWk9l0C/1acf3212ffa970a7463ea0cdf4b5b040/image3-28.png\" alt=\"Like the DNS filter and 1.1.1.1, we built our Gateway product after spending years improving a consumer equivalent, Cloudflare WARP.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1639\" height=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We also added new tools to help prevent cases where connections skip the DNS filter or Secure Web Gateway. Your team can capture the HTTP method, URL path, and other metadata about every request without on-premise appliances or traffic back haul.</p><p>Your team can <a href=\"/integrating-cloudflare-gateway-and-access/\">build rules</a> that require every login to a SaaS application pass through Cloudflare’s network before a user signs in to your identity provider, ensuring you never have a blind spot over what data is being accessed.

In many cases, the first target for these rules is an organization’s  customer relationship management (CRM) system. A CRM contains data about buyers, accounts, and revenue. Some of those records are much more sensitive than others but users on other teams - marketing, legal, and finance, for instance -  can connect to anything in the application.</p><p>You can now use Cloudflare’s Secure Web Gateway to <a href=\"/gateway-swg-3/\">create rules</a> that use your identity provider to restrict who can reach a specific part of any application, whether the application supports RBAC controls. If you want to allow team members to reach a record, but prevent users from downloading data, you can also <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/block-uploads\">control</a> who has permission to save data locally with file upload/download policies.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/9UkFcGLQ9Zvk9GbAvoF8G/3b74411e415de92b6f851873e48546b5/image4-28.png\" alt=\"If you want to allow team members to reach a record, but prevent users from downloading data, you can also control who has permission to save data locally with file upload/download policies.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1842\" height=\"1220\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Some applications support this level of identity-based RBAC, but we also hear from customers who need more scrutiny for certain datasets. One example is the requirement of a hard key as a second factor method. You can also use Cloudflare’s Zero Trust platform to add additional requirements when a user connects to certain applications, like forcing a hard key or specifying allowed countries.</p><p>We know that URL paths are not always standard and that applications evolve.
