That’s why for many parts of Pages we want your experience to be <i>limitless</i>.</p><p><b>Unlimited requests</b>: As your idea grows, so does your traffic. While thousands and millions of end users flock to your site, Pages is prepared to handle all of your traffic with no extra cost to you – even when millions turn to <i>billions.</i></p><p><b>Unlimited bandwidth:</b> As your traffic grows, you’ll need more bandwidth – and with Pages, we got you. If your site takes off in popularity one day, the next day shouldn’t be a cause for panic because of a nasty bill. It should be a day of celebration and pride. We’re giving unlimited bandwidth so you can keep your eyes focused on moving up and to the right.</p><p><b>Unlimited free seats:</b> With a rise in demand for your app, you’re going to need more folks working with you. We know from experience that more great ideas don’t just come from one person but a strong team of people. We want to be there every step of the way along with every person you want on this journey with you. Just because your team grows doesn’t mean your bill has to.</p><p><b>Unlimited projects</b>: With one great idea, means many more to follow. With Pages, you can deploy as many projects as you want – keep them coming! Not every idea is going to be the right one – we know this! Prove out your vision in private org-owned repos for free! Try out a plethora of development frameworks until you’ve found the perfect combination for your idea.
