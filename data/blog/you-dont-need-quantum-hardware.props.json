If you can efficiently solve the underlying math problem, you can efficiently break the cryptography and the systems that depend on it. As it turns out, the math problems underlying much of today’s public-key cryptography can be efficiently solved by specialized algorithms, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm\"><u>Shor’s algorithm</u></a>, on large-scale quantum computers. </p><p>The solution? Pick new hard math problems (like finding <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/lattice-crypto-primer/\"><u>“short” vectors in algebraic lattices</u></a>) that are no easier to solve with a quantum computer than with a conventional computer. Then, build new cryptographic systems around them. The <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/\"><u>US National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST)</u></a> launched an <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization\"><u>international competition</u></a> in 2016 to identify and standardize such cryptographic systems, which resulted in several new standards for post-quantum cryptography being published in 2024, and <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/\"><u>several more under consideration</u></a> for future standardization.</p><p>Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) runs on your existing phones, laptops, and servers.

Rather than relying on hard mathematical problems, QKD relies on principles of quantum physics to establish a shared symmetric secret between two parties, while ensuring that eavesdropping can be detected. QKD provides security guarantees that are based on physical properties of the communication channel. Once a shared secret is established, parties can switch to traditional symmetric-key cryptography for secure communication. QKD is the first step towards a futuristic “quantum Internet.” However, there are some fundamental reasons why QKD cannot be a general replacement for classical cryptography running on conventional hardware.</p><p>Most importantly, <i>QKD does not operate at Internet scale</i>. QKD is used to establish an unauthenticated secret between pairs of parties with a direct physical link between them. The parties can then use an authentication mechanism based on conventional cryptography to bootstrap a secure communication channel over that link. While building dedicated physical links may be feasible for cross-datacenter communication or across major Internet backbones, it is not possible for most pairs of parties on the Internet. In particular, deploying QKD for the “last-mile” connection to end-user devices would require that each device has a direct physical connection to every server or device it needs to securely communicate with.</p><p>Connectivity aside, there&#39;s a good reason why the Internet doesn&#39;t rely on secure point-to-point links: they do not scale (or rather, they scale exponentially). Bringing a new device online would require a change to <i>every other device</i> it needs to communicate with, a massive operational burden on everyone. Fortunately, there’s a better way. The <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/\"><u>OSI model</u></a> for networking provides an abstraction such that two parties can communicate even if they don’t share a direct physical link, so long as some chain of physical links exists between them. Public-key cryptography, invented in the seminal “<a href=\"https://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf\"><u>New Directions in Cryptography</u></a>” paper in 1976, allows two parties participating in the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure\"><u>public-key infrastructure</u></a> to establish a secure <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption\"><u>end-to-end encrypted</u></a> communication channel, without requiring any prior setup between them. The massive scaling enabled by these technologies is why the secure Internet exists as we know it. Secure point-to-point links are not part of the solution.</p><p>Lack of scalability is enough for us to disqualify QKD outright: if a technology can’t bring security to the whole Internet, we’re not going to spend much time on it.</p><p>The challenges with QKD don’t stop there though.</p><p>QKD touts theoretical security guarantees, but achieving security in practice is not so simple. QKD systems have been <a href=\"https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Studies/QKD-Systems/QKD-Systems.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3\"><u>plagued by implementation attacks</u></a>, both classical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\"><u>sidechannel attacks</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Studies/QKD-Systems/QKD-Systems.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3\"><u>new ones</u></a> specific to the technology. Further, QKD works best over a special medium: either <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4646568/\"><u>fiber</u></a> or a <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.19.064003\"><u>vacuum</u></a>. QKD has been demonstrated <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/16/4/043003\"><u>over the air</u></a>, but performance and the implementation security mentioned before suffers. We still have not seen QKD work on a mobile phone or over Wi-Fi networks.</p><p>Further, neither QKD nor any other quantum technologies provide authentication to prove that the party on the other end of the key exchange is who you think they are. This opens the door for a classic <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/monsters-in-the-middleboxes/\"><u>monster in the middle (MITM)</u></a> attack, where an adversary intercepts your connection, establishes a separate secure QKD link to you and your intended destination, and then sits in the middle reading and relaying all traffic. To prevent this, you must authenticate the identity of the party you are connecting to, using either <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-shared_key\"><u>pre-shared keys</u></a> or conventional public-key cryptography. The bottom line is, whether or not you invest in QKD, you still need a solution for authentication to protect against active attackers armed with quantum computers. Practically speaking, that means you need PQC, but PQC is already a standalone solution that provides both authentication and key agreement, which leads to questions of why use QKD in the first place.</p><p>Some <a href=\"https://www.amazon.science/blog/qkd-and-authentication-separating-facts-from-myths\"><u>proponents</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.bluequbit.io/quantum-internet\"><u>argue</u></a> that QKD should be integrated into existing systems as an extra security layer. The value proposition of QKD relates to the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later\"><u>harvest now, decrypt later</u></a>” threat. In public-key cryptography, the key exchange messages used to set up encryption keys to secure a communication channel are exchanged in full view of a potential adversary. If an adversary records the key exchange messages, they might hope to use improved techniques in the future to solve the hard math problems upon which the security of the key exchange relies, allowing them to recover the encryption keys and decrypt the communication. If encryption keys are exchanged directly via QKD instead, the eavesdropper protections provided by QKD stop an adversary from recording messages that could later allow them to recover the encryption key (e.g. by using a quantum computer or other advances in cryptanalysis). The problem is, however, that this “extra security layer” is brittle, and limited to a single physical link. As soon as the data is transmitted elsewhere — for instance at an Internet exchange point or to travel to an end-user — the QKD security ends.

Other types of classical (non-quantum) TRNGs use physical phenomena that exhibit random properties, such as <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/982700\"><u>thermal noise</u></a> from electrical components, the motion of hot wax in <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production/\"><u>lava lamps</u></a>, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/harnessing-office-chaos/#londons-unpredictable-pendulums\"><u>double pendulums</u></a>, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/harnessing-office-chaos/#austins-mesmerizing-mobiles\"><u>hanging mobiles</u></a>, or <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/chaos-in-cloudflare-lisbon-office-securing-the-internet-with-wave-motion/\"><u>water wave machines</u></a>.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6hDsBCSgInfwiAP7Qlnmth/8c1601c30a8982a164edfd096a3792a6/image_-_2025-09-19T141347.781.png\" alt=\"lava lamps image\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1612\" height=\"381\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>In cryptography and computer security, the essential property required from a random number generator is that the outputs are unpredictable and unbiased. This can be achieved by taking a small seed (say, 256 bits) of true randomness and feeding it to a cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to produce an essentially limitless stream of pseudorandom output indistinguishable from true randomness. The randomness used to seed the CSPRNG can be based on either classical or quantum physical processes, as long as it is not known to the adversary. Whether or not you use a QRNG to generate the seed, a CSPRNG is essential for cryptographic applications.</p><p>We are the first to get excited about <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production/\"><u>fun</u></a> <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/chaos-in-cloudflare-lisbon-office-securing-the-internet-with-wave-motion/\"><u>new</u></a> <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/harnessing-office-chaos/\"><u>sources</u></a> of <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/league-of-entropy/\"><u>randomness</u></a>. However, we’d like to emphasize that randomness derived from quantum effects is not necessary to combat threats from quantum computers. Quantum computers do not enable any practical new attacks against classical TRNGs in widespread use today. Your decision to invest in QRNGs should be based on a perceived improvement in the quality of randomness they produce and not on a perceived threat to classical TRNGs from quantum computing.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"post-quantum-cryptography-at-cloudflare\">Post-quantum cryptography at Cloudflare</h2>\n      <a href=\"#post-quantum-cryptography-at-cloudflare\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare has been at the forefront of developing and deploying PQC, and we are committed to making PQC available <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-crypto-should-be-free\"><u>for free and by default</u></a> for all of our products.
