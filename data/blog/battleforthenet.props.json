Net Neutrality Call-A-Thon »</a></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/\">Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</a> has scheduled a vote to terminate its net neutrality rules this Thursday, December 14th. Unfortunately, the expectation is that the FCC will vote to repeal its net neutrality rules. Read about this on <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-will-lead-to-higher-prices-fewer-choices-2017-12\">Business Insider</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-15/killing-net-neutrality-rules-is-said-readied-for-december-vote\">Bloomberg</a>, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/16/fcc-reportedly-planning-vote-that-could-kill-net-neutrality-next-month/\">TechCrunch</a>.</p><p>Net neutrality is the principle that networks should not discriminate against content that passes through them. The FCC’s net neutrality rules protect the Internet, users, and companies from abusive behavior by the largest Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Without net neutrality rules in place, ISPs may be able to legally create a &quot;pay to play&quot; system and charge websites to provide content to their customers more quickly. This will create a disadvantage for startups, bloggers, and everyone else who cannot afford to pay fees for their websites to offer faster service.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare</a> founders and employees strongly believe in the principle of network neutrality. Cloudflare co-founder and COO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zatlyn\">Michelle Zatlyn</a>, sat on the FCC&#39;s Open Internet Advisory Committee, which guided the FCC to vote to preserve net neutrality in 2015. Cloudflare co-founder and CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eastdakota\">Matthew Prince</a> and other employees have written four blog posts <a href=\"/moving-beyond-the-dc-circuit-court-decision-on-the-fccs-open-internet-order/\">1</a>, <a href=\"/net-neutrality/\">2</a>, <a href=\"/net-neutrality-day-of-action/\">3</a>, <a href=\"/netneutrality-cloudflare-fftf/\">4</a>, describing Cloudflare’s views on net neutrality.</p><p>I am extremely disappointed that net neutrality is under threat. I am extremely grateful that I work at a company made of people who are fighting for it and I&#39;m hopeful our community (you) can make a difference.</p><p><b>Read, watch, listen, and learn much more about net neutrality and its importance below.</b></p><p>For now, here is my <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fpbOEoRrHyU\">favorite video explanation</a> of net neutrality, by <a href=\"http://iamjohnoliver.com/\">John Oliver</a>, host of <a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver\">Last Week Tonight</a> on HBO.</p><p>---------------- ### Battle for the Net</p><p>Because net neutrality is under attack, the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/net-neutrality\">Battle for the Net</a> app is once again live on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/\">Cloudflare Apps</a>.

This will initiate a process where users will receive calls at the same time each day, connecting them to their congresspeople.</p><p>To make one-time calls, users can just stay on the line. The recording delivers a recommended script to inform the congressperson on the line that the user supports net neutrality and wants the congressperson to contact FCC Chairman Pai and oppose the repeal.</p><p>Here&#39;s the written script:</p><p><b>Be polite, introduce yourself, and say: “I support the </b><i><b>existing</b></i><b> Title II net neutrality rules and I would like you to publicly oppose the FCC’s plan to repeal them.”</b></p><p>When done with the first call, users may press * to be directed to another call to their next congressperson.</p><p>I live in San Francisco, so my first call was directed to <a href=\"https://pelosi.house.gov/\">Representative Nancy Pelosi</a>.

There were no clear legal protections requiring net neutrality until 2015.</p></li><li><p>2015: The FCC classified broadband as a Title II communication service with providers being &quot;common carriers&quot;, not &quot;information providers&quot;, under former <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwheelerfcc?lang=en\">Chairman Tom Wheeler</a>. Adoption of this notion would reclassify Internet service from one of information to one of telecommunications and ensure net neutrality. Wheeler stated, &quot;This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. They both stand for the same concept.&quot; Read more about the 2015 rules in <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/fcc-passes-new-rules-net-neutrality-and-municipal-broadband-309715\">this Newsweek article</a>.</p></li><li><p>January, 2017: Ajit Pai was named the new Chairman of the FCC by President Trump.
