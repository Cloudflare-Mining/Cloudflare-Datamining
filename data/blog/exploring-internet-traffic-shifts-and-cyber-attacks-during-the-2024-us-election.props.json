They depend on citizens being able to register to vote and accessing information about candidates and the election process, which in turn depend on the strength and security of the Internet. Despite the risks posed by potential cyberattacks aimed to disrupt democracy, Cloudflare did not observe any significant disruptions to campaigns or local government websites from cyberattack.</p><p>Tuesday, November 5, 2024 was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election\"><u>Election Day in the United States</u></a>. It not only decided the next president and vice president but also included elections for the US Senate, House of Representatives, state governorships, and state legislatures. Results confirm that Republican Donald Trump won the presidential election.</p><p>In this blog post, we examine online attacks against election-related sites — some of which were notable but none were disruptive — and how initial election results impacted Internet traffic across the US at both national and state levels, with increases in traffic as much as 15% nationwide. We’ll also explore email phishing trends and general DNS data around news interest, the candidates, and election-related activity.</p><p>We’ve been tracking 2024 elections globally through our <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/election-security/\"><u>blog</u></a> and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/elections-2024\"><u>election report on Cloudflare Radar</u></a>, covering some of the more than 60 national elections around the globe this year. At Cloudflare, we support many of these efforts to ensure a secure and trustworthy election process. We worked closely with election officials, government agencies, and civil society groups across the country to ensure that groups working in the election space had the tools they needed to stay online. </p><p>Regarding the US elections, we have previously reported on trends surrounding the first <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-first-2024-us-presidential-debate-influenced-internet-traffic-and-security-trends\"><u>Biden vs. Trump debate</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/exploring-internet-traffic-during-the-2024-us-republican-national-convention\"><u>attempted assassination of Trump and the Republican National Convention</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-security-trends-2024-us-democratic-convention\"><u>Democratic National Convention</u></a>, and the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-harris-trump-us-presidential-debate-influenced-internet-traffic\"><u>Harris-Trump presidential debate</u></a>.</p><p>Key takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>In the 24 hour period from October 31 - November 1, Cloudflare automatically mitigated over 6 billion HTTP DDoS requests that targeted US election-related websites–such as state and local government election sites and political campaigns. There were no significant disruptions to the targeted websites during this time period.</p></li><li><p>The day before the election, DNS traffic to Trump/Republican and Harris/Democrat websites peaked, with daily DNS traffic rising 59% and 4% respectively.</p></li><li><p>On election day, states in the midwest saw the highest traffic growth across the US, as compared to the previous week. </p></li><li><p>Internet traffic in the US peaked after the first polling stations closed, with a 15% increase over the previous week. </p></li><li><p>DNS traffic to news, polling, and election websites also saw large traffic jumps.
