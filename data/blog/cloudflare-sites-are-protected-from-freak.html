	<p>The newly announced <a href="https://freakattack.com">FREAK</a> vulnerability is not a concern for CloudFlare's SSL customers. We do not support 'export grade' cryptography (which, by its nature, is weak) and we upgraded to the non-vulnerable version of OpenSSL the day it was released in early January.</p>

	<p>Our OpenSSL configuration is freely available on our Github account <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/sslconfig">here</a> as are our patches to OpenSSL 1.0.2.</p>
	<p>We strive to stay on top of vulnerabilities as they are announced; in this case no action was necessary as we were already protected by decisions to eliminate cipher suites and upgrade software.</p>
	<p>We are also pro-active about disabling protocols and ciphers that are outdated (such as <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sslv3-support-disabled-by-default-due-to-vulnerability">SSLv3</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/end-of-the-road-for-rc4">RC4</a>) and keep up to date with the latest and most secure ciphers (such as <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/do-the-chacha-better-mobile-performance-with-cryptography">ChaCha-Poly</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-on-top-of-tls-attacks">forward secrecy</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography">elliptic curves</a>).</p>
