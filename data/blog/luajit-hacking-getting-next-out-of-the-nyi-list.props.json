But it’s not always easy to get the most out of it, and sometimes a small change in one part of your code can negatively impact other, already optimized, parts.</p><p>One of the first pieces of advice anyone receives when writing Lua code to run quickly using LuaJIT is “avoid the NYIs”: the language or library features that can’t be compiled because they’re NYI (not yet implemented). And that means they run in the interpreter.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1iZfOn4qOz1IUbak9b2uFF/dd3dee6346b8d8cb1faee553a4c04c7c/6822250770_d6f8399cf2_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"434\" height=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC BY-SA 2.0</a> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/zengei/6822250770/in/photolist-boRPth-7xeiAm-e6H8w5-dSoqGF-FiYGj-okoVwy-e1ugbE-dXhvop-8fQNCX-974Bts-ekbDjn-p9HV9L-971y78-bdb8Hi-e2Us2u-8fU4pm-9ZFfXg-g469T-7Ft9Jc-9YWa6m-95HYN2-95J19D-5JeU76-95M3qb-PFZRj-9uYpbM-6bJrpt-D2DfZK-Ccqoxs-Jqvvxd-kSQzNX-JyLzNN-dEnx4T-dezBQR-e2NN7a-6aP8op-971xFi-974BBJ-qR8GWh-5De3Sy-974CTy-gyUry-dezAkY-7qHBJ2-eHJH4W-9v2qQs-dCQMt7-nBkbJ7-eZ8yc-e3u6kJ\">image</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/zengei/\">Dwayne Bent</a></p><p>Another very attractive feature of LuaJIT is the FFI library, which allows Lua code to directly interface with C code and memory structures. The JIT compiler weaves these memory operations in line with the generated machine language, making it much more efficient than using the traditional Lua C API.</p><p>Unfortunately, if for any reason the Lua code using the FFI library has to run under the interpreter, it takes a very heavy performance hit. As it happens, under the interpreter the FFI is usually much slower than the Lua C API or the basic operations. For many people, this means either avoiding the FFI or committing to a permanent vigilance to maintain the code from falling back to the interpreter.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"optimizing-luajit-code\">Optimizing LuaJIT Code</h3>\n            <a href=\"#optimizing-luajit-code\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Before optimizing any code, it’s important to identify which parts are actually important. It’s useless to discuss what’s the fastest way to add a few numbers before sending some data, if the send operation will take a million times longer than that addition. Likewise, there’s no benefit avoiding NYI features in code like initialization routines that might run only a few times, as it’s unlikely that the JIT would even try to optimize them, so they would always run in the interpreter. Which, by the way, is also very fast; even faster than the first version of LuaJIT itself.</p><p>But optimizing the core parts of a Lua program, like any deep inner loops, can yield huge improvements in the overall performance. In similar situations, experienced developers using other languages are used to inspecting the assembly language generated by the compiler, to see if there’s some change to the source code that can make the result better.</p><p>The command line LuaJIT executable provides a bytecode list when running with the <code>-jbc</code> option, a statistical profiler, activated with the <code>-jp</code> option, a trace list with <code>-jv</code>, and finally a detailed dump of all the JIT operations with <code>-jdump</code>.</p><p>The last two provide lots of information very useful for understanding what actually happens with the Lua code while executing, but it can be a lot of work to read the huge lists generated by <code>-jdump</code>. Also, some messages are hard to understand without a fairly complete understanding of how the tracing compiler in LuaJIT actually works.</p><p>One very nice feature is that all these JIT options are implemented in Lua. To accomplish this the JIT provides ‘hooks’ that can execute a Lua function at important moments with the relevant information. Sometimes the best way to understand what some <code>-jdump</code> output actually means is to read the code that generated that specific part of the output.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3ofHRCoePgNqk4t0T1HlqM/99308b3b82e6c6f60f2a00a1c596e7e6/6353190489_1363ec7f16_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">CC BY 2.0</a> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevandotorg/6353190489/in/photolist-aFpLc4-6Rorty-gvhKC9-8UEeqU-aBoHof-9qr8bs-9qo6Ai-9qrafb-FhYA4L-CH4r5G-8HZcMK-pX32R-6SJMc6-pX39e-oXee8D-aBoHBJ-cLgitL-cLgeKY-3THPb-hzKrGL-cLggDJ-6Rh35p-dqkQyJ-7Ey5Pz-6RkwNh-6RgYDe-7C7F9S-6RgxKH-6RkLFN-i4HqqU-6Rktx9-6RkXKQ-6RgRqD-6RkmBs-6RgML2-6RkE4j-6Rg5nT-6RjKkq-6RfDK2-6RfRRc-6RfYfK-6RfUT8-6RjN4d-hzMBtc-hzNnyN-hzJiM8-hzJVpv-hzLE56-hzKU4c-9mQrRy\">image</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevandotorg/\">Kevan</a></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"introducing-loom\">Introducing Loom</h3>\n            <a href=\"#introducing-loom\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>After several rounds there, and being frustrated by the limitations of the sequentially-generated dump, I decided to write a different version of <code>-jdump</code>, one that gathered more information to process and add cross-references to help see how things are related before displaying.

Each one shows some bytecode instructions, an IR listing, and the final mcode. There are several options to turn on and off each listing, and more info like the registers allocated to some IR instructions, the “snapshot” structures that allow the interpreter to continue when a compiled trace exits, etc.</p><p>Now using loom:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=/content/images/2017/02/image00.png>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2gsTyF05jZO2nJd8HvEec8/574ce9cc0591d4ac83e49ae3d2b863ad/image00.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1913\" height=\"1534\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>There’s the source code, with the corresponding bytecodes, and the same two traces, with IR and mcode listings.

And then, I was able to use loom not only to analyze and optimize Cloudflare’s Lua code, but also to watch the steps the compiler goes through to make it run fast, and also what happens when it’s not happy.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-code-is-the-code-is-the-code-is-the-code\">The code is the code is the code is the code</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-code-is-the-code-is-the-code-is-the-code\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>LuaJIT handles up to four different representation of a program’s code:</p><p>First comes the source code, what the developer writes.</p><p>The parser analyzes the source code and produces the Bytecode, which is what the interpreter actually executes. It has the same flow of the source code, grouped in functions, with all the calls, iterators, operations, etc. Of course, there’s no nice formatting, comments, the local variable names are replaced by indices, and all constants (other than small numbers) are stored in a separate area.</p><p>When the interpreter finds that a given point of the bytecode has been repeated several times, it’s considered a “hot” part of the code, and interprets it once again but this time it records each bytecode it encounters, generating a “code trace” or just “a trace”. At the same time, it generates an “intermediate representation”, or IR, of the code as it’s executed. The IR doesn’t represent the whole of the function or code portion, just the actual options it actually takes.</p><p>A trace is finished when it hits a loop or a recursion, returns to a lower level than when started, hits a NYI operation, or simply becomes too long. At this point, it can be either compiled into machine language, or aborted if it has reached some code that can’t be correctly translated. If successful, the bytecode is patched with an entry to the machine code, or “mcode”. If aborted, the initial trace point is “penalized” or even “blocklisted” to avoid wasting time trying to compile it again.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"whats\">What’s </h3>\n            <a href=\"#whats\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>One of the most visible characteristics of the Lua language is the heavy use of dictionary objects called <i>tables</i>. From the <a href=\"https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.2\">Lua manual</a>:</p><p><i>“Tables are the sole data structuring mechanism in Lua; they can be used to represent ordinary arrays, symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees, etc.”</i></p><p>To iterate over all the elements in a table, the idiomatic way is to use the standard library function <code>pairs()</code> like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">for k, v in pairs(t) do\n    -- use the key in ‘k’ and the value in ‘v’\nend</pre></code>\n            <p>In the standard Lua manual, <code>pairs()</code> is <a href=\"https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-pairs\">defined</a> as “Returns three values: the <code>next</code> function, the table <code>t</code>, and <code>nil</code>”, so the previous code is the same as:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">for k, v in next, t, nil do\n    -- use the key in ‘k’ and the value in ‘v’\nend</pre></code>\n            <p>But unfortunately, both the <code>next()</code> and <code>pairs()</code> functions are listed as “not compiled” in the feared <a href=\"http://wiki.luajit.org/NYI#libraries_base-library\">NYI list</a>. That means that any such code runs on the interpreter and is not compiled, unless the code inside is complex enough, and has other inner loops (loops that doesn’t use <code>next()</code> or <code>pairs()</code>, of course). Even in that case, the code would have to fall back to the interpreter at each loop end.</p><p>This sad news creates a tradeoff: for performance sensitive parts of the code, don’t use the most Lua-like code style. That motivates people to come up with several contortions to be able to use numerical iteration (which is compiled, and very efficient), like replacing any key with a number, storing all the keys in a numbered array, or store both keys and values at even/odd numeric indices.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"getting\">Getting </h3>\n            <a href=\"#getting\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>So, I finally have a non-NYI <code>next()</code> function!

The only conditional branches are the &quot;guards&quot; that make sure that the code to be executed is the appropriate one. If a condition changes and it must now do something different, the trace must be exited. If it happens several times, it will spawn a side trace and the exit will be patched into a conditional branch.

In addition, every instruction can be a type guard, if the arguments are not of the expected type the trace will be exited.</p><p>Lua is dynamically typed, every value is tagged with type information so the bytecode interpreter can apply the correct operations on it. This allows us to have variables and tables that can contain and pass around any kind of object without changing the source code. Of course, this requires the interpreter to be coded very &quot;defensively&quot;, to consider all valid ramifications of every instruction, limiting the possibility of optimizations. The IR traces, on the other hand, are optimized for a single variation of the code, and deal with only the value types that are actually observed while executing.</p><p>For example, this simple code creates a 1,000 element array and then copies to another table:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">local t,t2 = {},{}\nfor i=1,1000 do\n    t[i] = i\nend\nfor i,v in ipairs(t) do\n    t2[i]=v\nend</pre></code>\n            <p>resulting in this IR for the second loop, the one that does the copy:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">0023 ------------ LOOP ------------\n0024          num CONV   0017  num.int\n0025       &gt;  int ABC    0005  0017\n0026          p32 AREF   0007  0017\n0027          num ASTORE 0026  0022\n0028 rbp    + int ADD    0017  +1\n0029       &gt;  int ABC    0018  0028\n0030          p32 AREF   0020  0028\n0031 xmm7  &gt;+ num ALOAD  0030\n0032 xmm7     num PHI    0022  0031\n0033 rbp      int PHI    0017  0028\n0034 rbx      nil RENAME 0017  #3\n0035 xmm6     nil RENAME 0022  #2</pre></code>\n            <p>Here we see the <code>ALOAD</code> in instruction <code>0031</code> assures that the value loaded from the table is in effect a number.

To get <code>pairs()</code> compiled, I just disabled the <code>ISNEXT</code>/<code>ITERN</code> optimization, so it actually uses <code>next()</code>. In the third test the variable in the addition is initialized to <code>0ULL</code> instead of just <code>0</code>, triggering the use of FFI.</p><p>First test is with all 10,000 elements on sequential integers, making the table a valid sequence, so <code>ipairs()</code> (which is already compiled) can be used just as well:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=/content/images/2017/02/image02.png>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4m2lJk0jSnK7D5qd81PEgz/78b165a0310c4f1f82b2f67afa6bdae1/image02.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>So, compiled <code>next()</code> is quite a lot faster, but the <code>pairs()</code> optimization in the interpreter is very fast. On the other hand, the smallest smell of FFI completely trashes interpreter performance, while making compiled code slightly tighter. Finally, <code>ipairs()</code> is faster, but a big part of it is because it stops on the first <code><b>nil</b></code>, while <code>next()</code> has to skip over every <code><b>nil</b></code> at the end of the array, which by default can be up to twice as big as the sequence itself.</p><p>Now with 5,000 (sequential) integer keys and 5,000 string keys. Of course, we can&#39;t use <code>ipairs()</code> here:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=/content/images/2017/02/image01.png>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2c4yKNAwBjIqqQDz8Em4Hr/539facf85d6f05e6c8252f223d39178d/image01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>Roughly the same pattern: the compiled <code>next()</code> performance is very much the same on the three forms (used directly, under <code>pairs()</code> and with FFI code), while the interpreter benefits from the <code>pairs()</code> optimization and almost dies with FFI. In this case, the interpreted <code>pairs()</code> actually surpasses the compiled <code>next()</code> performance, hinting that separately optimizing <code>pairs()</code> is still desirable.</p><p>A big factor in the interpreter <code>pairs()</code> is that it doesn&#39;t use <code>next()</code>; instead it directly drives the loop with a hidden variable to iterate in the <code>Node</code> table without having to perform a hash lookup on every step.</p><p>Repeating that in a compiled <code>pairs()</code> would be equally beneficial; but has to be done carefully to maintain compatibility with the interpreter. On any trace exit the interpreter would kick in and must be able to seamlessly continue iterating. For that, the rest of the system has to be aware of that hidden variable.</p><p>The best part of this is that we have lots of very challenging, yet deeply rewarding, work ahead of us!
