	<p>The early hours of Sunday, January 23, 2022, started in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso" target="_blank">Burkina Faso</a> with an Internet outage or shutdown. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-burkina-faso-ouagadougou-roch-marc-christian-kabore-b5f6654b95362410df94852ff7a774d9" target="_blank">Heavy gunfire</a> in an army mutiny could be related to the outage according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/23/world/africa/burkina-faso-mutiny-gunfire.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> (“mobile Internet services were shut down”). As of today, there are three countries affected by major Internet disruptions — Tonga and Yemen are the others.</p>
	<p><a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/bf?date_filter=last_7_days" target="_blank">Cloudflare Radar</a> shows that Internet traffic dropped significantly in the West African country after ~09:15 UTC (the same in local time) and remains low more than 24 hours later. Burkina Faso also had a mobile <a href="https://afriksoir.net/actualite/burkina-faso-internet-encore-coupe-au-lendemain-sommet-cedeao/" target="_blank">Internet shutdown</a> on January 10, 2022, and another we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/burkina-faso-internet-shutdown/">reported</a> in late November 2021.</p>

	<p>The main ISPs from Burkina Faso were affected. The two leading Internet Service Providers Orange and FasoNet lost Internet traffic after 09:15 UTC, but also Telecel Faso, as the next chart shows. This morning, at around 10:00 UTC there was some traffic from FasoNet but less than half of what we saw at the same time in preceding days.</p>

	<p>It’s not only mobile traffic that is affected. Desktop traffic is also impacted. In Burkina Faso, our data shows that mobile devices normally represent 70% of Internet traffic.</p>

	<p>With the Burkina Faso disruption, three countries are currently mostly without access to the Internet for different reasons.</p>
	<p>In <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ye" target="_blank">Yemen</a>, as we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-outage-in-yemen-amid-airstrikes/">reported</a>, the four day-long outage is related to airstrikes that affected a telecommunications building in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hudaydah" target="_blank">Al-Hudaydah</a> where the <a href="https://www.submarinenetworks.com/en/systems/asia-europe-africa/falcon" target="_blank">FALCON undersea cable</a> lands.</p>

	<p>In <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/to?date_filter=last_30_days" target="_blank">Tonga</a>, the nine day-long outage that we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tonga-internet-outage/">also explained</a> is related to problems in the undersea cable caused by the large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Hunga_Tonga_eruption_and_tsunami" target="_blank">volcanic eruption</a> in the South Pacific archipelago.</p>
