But real-world customer experiences showed us that stopping attacks at the edge isn’t always enough. We saw ransomware disrupt financial operations, data breaches cripple real estate firms, and misconfigurations cause major data losses.</p><p>In each case, the real damage occurred <i>inside</i> networks.</p><p>These internal breaches uncovered another problem: customers had to hand off incidents to separate internal teams for investigation and remediation. Those handoffs created delays and fractured the response. The result was a gap that attackers could exploit. Critical context collected at the edge didn’t reach the teams managing cleanup, and valuable time was lost. Closing this gap has become essential, and we recognized the need to take responsibility for providing customers with a more unified defense.</p><p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/\"><u>Cloudforce One</u></a> is launching a new suite of <a href=\"http://cloudflare.com/cloudforce-one/services/incident-response\"><u>incident response and security services</u></a> to help organizations prepare for and respond to breaches.</p><p>These services are delivered by <b>Cloudforce One REACT (Respond, Evaluate, Assess, Consult Team)</b>, a group of seasoned responders and security veterans who investigate threats, hunt adversaries, and work closely with executive leadership to guide response and decision-making.\n\nCustomers already trust Cloudforce One to provide industry-leading <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudforce-one/research/\"><u>threat intelligence</u></a>, proactively identifying and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/research/report/cloudflare-participates-in-global-operation-to-disrupt-raccoono365/\"><u>neutralizing</u></a> the most sophisticated threats. REACT extends that partnership, bringing our expertise directly to customer environments to stop threats wherever they occur. In this post, we’ll introduce REACT, explain how it works, detail the top threats our team has observed, and show you how to engage our experts directly for support.</p><p>Our goal is simple: to provide an end-to-end<b> security partnership</b>. We want to eliminate the painful gap between defense and recovery. Now, customers can get everything from proactive preparation to decisive incident response and full recovery—all from the partner you already trust to protect your infrastructure.</p><p>It’s time to move beyond fragmented responses and into one unified, powerful defense.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-react-works\">How REACT works</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-react-works\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>REACT services consist of two main components: Security advisory services to prepare for incidents and incident response for emergency situations.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5NvO487oZA6GrphFGNORGt/a49489f86f7a556dd9fcbffdf42a8b33/image5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1716\" height=\"1036\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>A breakdown of the Cloudforce One incident readiness and response service offerings.</i></sup></p><p>Advisory services are designed to assess and improve an organization&#39;s security posture and readiness. These include proactive threat hunting, backed by Cloudflare’s real-time global threat intelligence, to find existing compromises, tabletop exercises to test response plans against simulated attacks, and both incident readiness and maturity assessments to identify and address systemic weaknesses.</p><p>The Incident Response component is initiated during an active security crisis. The team specializes in handling a range of complex threats, including APT and nation-state activity, ransomware, insider threats, and business email compromise. The response is also informed by Cloudflare&#39;s threat intelligence and, as a network-native service, allows responders to deploy mitigation measures directly at the Cloudflare edge for faster containment.</p><p>For organizations requiring guaranteed availability, incident response retainers are offered. These retainers provide priority response, the development of tailored playbooks, and ongoing advisory support.</p><p>Cloudflare’s REACT services are vendor-agnostic in their scope. We are making REACT available to both existing Cloudflare customers and non-customers, regardless of their current technology stack, and regardless of whether their environment is on-premise, public cloud, or hybrid.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"what-makes-cloudflares-approach-different\">What makes Cloudflare&#39;s approach different?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#what-makes-cloudflares-approach-different\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Our new service provides significant advantages over traditional incident response, where engagement and data sharing occur over separate, out-of-band channels. The integration of the service into the platform enables a more efficient and effective response to threats.</p><p>The core differentiators of this approach are:</p><ul><li><p><b>Unmatched threat visibility. </b>With roughly 20% of the web sitting behind Cloudflare&#39;s network, Cloudforce One has unique visibility into emerging attacks as they unfold globally. This lets REACT accelerate their investigations and quickly correlate incident details with emerging attack vectors and known adversary tactics.</p></li><li><p><b>Network-native mitigation.</b> The service is designed for network-native response. This allows the team, with customer authorization, to deploy mitigations directly at the Cloudflare edge, such as a <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/\"><u>WAF rule</u></a> or <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/\"><u>Secure Web Gateway policy</u></a>. This capability reduces the time between threat identification and containment. All response actions are tracked within the dashboard for full visibility.</p></li><li><p><b>Service delivery by proven experts.</b> Cloudforce One is composed of seasoned threat researchers, consultants, and incident responders. The team has a documented history of managing complex security incidents, including nation-state activity and sophisticated financial fraud.</p></li><li><p><b>Vendor-agnostic scope.</b> While managed through the Cloudflare dashboard, the scope of the response is vendor-agnostic. The team is equipped to conduct investigations and coordinate remediation across diverse customer environments, including on-premise, public cloud, and hybrid infrastructures.</p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"key-threats-seen-during-engagements-so-far\">Key Threats Seen During Engagements So Far</h2>\n      <a href=\"#key-threats-seen-during-engagements-so-far\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Analysis of security engagements by the REACT team over the last six months reveals three prevalent and high-impact trends.
