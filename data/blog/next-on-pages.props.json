Next.js is the fourth full-stack web framework that the Pages platform officially supports, and it is <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/jamstack\">one of the most popular in the &#39;Jamstack-y&#39; space</a>.</p><p>Cloudflare Pages started its journey as a platform for static websites, but with <a href=\"/cloudflare-pages-goes-full-stack/\">last year&#39;s addition of Pages Functions</a> powered by Cloudflare Workers, the platform has progressed to support an even more diverse range of use cases. Pages Functions allows developers to sprinkle in small pieces of server-side code with its simple file-based routing, or, as we&#39;ve seen with the adoption from other frameworks (namely <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-svelte-site/\">SvelteKit</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/remix/\">Remix</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-qwik-site/\">Qwik</a>), Pages Functions can be used to power your entire full-stack app. The folks behind <a href=\"/remix-on-cloudflare-pages/\">Remix previously talked about the advantages of adopting open standards</a>, and we&#39;ve seen this again with Next.js&#39; Edge Runtime.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"next-js-edge-runtime\">Next.js' Edge Runtime</h2>\n            <a href=\"#next-js-edge-runtime\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime\">Next.js&#39; Edge Runtime</a> is an experimental mode that developers can opt into which results in a different type of application being built. Previously, Next.js applications which relied on server-side rendering (SSR) functionality had to be deployed on a Node.js server. Running a Node.js server has significant overhead, and our Cloudflare Workers platform was fundamentally built on a different technology, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works/\">V8</a>.</p><p>However, when Next.js <a href=\"https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-the-edge-runtime\">introduced the Edge Runtime mode</a> in June 2022, we saw the opportunity to bring this widely used framework to our platform. We&#39;re very excited that this is being developed in coordination with the <a href=\"/introducing-the-wintercg/\">WinterCG</a> standards to ensure interoperability across the various web platforms and to ensure that developers have the choice on where they run their business, without fearing any significant vendor lock-in.</p><p>It’s important to note that some existing Next.js apps built for Node.js won&#39;t immediately work on Pages. If your application relies on any Node.js built-ins or long-running processes, then Pages may not support your app with today’s announcement as we&#39;re working on <a href=\"/node-js-support-cloudflare-workers/\">expanding our support for Node.js</a>.</p><p>However, we see the migration to the Edge Runtime as an effort that&#39;s worthy of investment, to run your applications, well, on the edge! These applications are cheaper to run, respond faster to users and have the latest features that full-stack frameworks offer. We&#39;re seeing increased interest in third-party npm packages and libraries that support standardized runtimes, and in combination with Cloudflare&#39;s data products (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/\">KV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/durable-objects/\">Durable Objects</a> and <a href=\"/whats-new-with-d1/\">D1</a>), we&#39;re confident that the edge is going to be the first place that people will want to deploy applications going forward.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"deploy-your-next-js-app-to-cloudflare-pages\">Deploy your Next.js app to Cloudflare Pages</h2>\n            <a href=\"#deploy-your-next-js-app-to-cloudflare-pages\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Let’s walk through an example, creating a new Next.js application that opts into this Edge Runtime and deploying it to Cloudflare Pages.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">npx create-next-app@latest my-app</pre></code>\n            <p>This will create a new Next.js app in the <code>my-app</code> folder.

This will enable us to use <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-server-side-props\">the <code>getServerSideProps()</code> API</a> and server-side render (SSR) our webpages.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">// next.config.js\n\n/** @type {import(&#039;next&#039;).NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    runtime: &#039;experimental-edge&#039;,\n  },\n  reactStrictMode: true,\n  swcMinify: true,\n}\nmodule.exports = nextConfig</pre></code>\n            <p>Finally, we&#39;re ready to deploy the project. Publish it to a GitHub or GitLab repository, create a new Pages project, and select &quot;Next.js&quot; from the list of framework presets. This will configure your project to use <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages\">the <code>@cloudflare/next-on-pages</code> CLI</a> which builds and transforms your project into something we can deploy on Pages. Navigate to the project settings and add an environment variable, <code>NODE_VERSION</code> set to <code>14</code> or greater, as well as the following compatibility flags: <code>streams_enable_constructors</code> and <code>transformstream_enable_standard_constructor</code>.

We&#39;ve decided to hook into this same API as a way to build Next.js projects consistently that we can understand and deploy.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages\">open-source</a> <code>[@cloudflare/next-on-pages](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages)</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages\">CLI</a> runs <code>npx vercel build</code> behind the scenes, which produces a <code>.vercel/output</code> directory. This directory conforms to the <a href=\"https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3\">Build Output API</a>, and of particular interest, contains a <code>config.json</code>, <code>static</code> folder and folder of <code>functions</code>. The <code>@cloudflare/next-on-pages</code> CLI then parses this <code>config.json</code> manifest, and combines all the <code>functions</code> into a single <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/#advanced-mode\">Pages Functions &#39;advanced mode&#39; <code>_worker.js</code></a>.</p><p>At this point, the build is finished. Pages then automatically picks up this <code>_worker.js</code> and deploys it with Pages Functions atop the <code>static</code> directory.</p><p>Although currently just an implementation detail, we opted to use this Build Output API for a number of reasons. We’re also exploring other similar functionality natively on the Pages platform. We already have one &quot;magical&quot; directory, the <code>functions</code> directory which we use for the file-based routing of Pages Functions. It&#39;s possible that we offer other fixed directory structures which would reduce the need for configuration of any projects using frameworks which adopt the API. Let us know <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/595317990191398933/910978223968518144\">in Discord</a> if you have any thoughts or preferences on what you would like to see!</p><p>Additionally, if more full-stack frameworks do adopt Vercel&#39;s Build Output API, we may have automatic support for them running on Pages with this CLI. We&#39;ve only been experimenting with Next.js here so far (and SvelteKit, Remix and Qwik all have their own way of building their projects on Pages at the moment), but it&#39;s possible that in the future we may converge on a standard approach which could be shared between frameworks and platforms. We&#39;re excited to see how this might transpire.

This means that each function ends up looking something like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">let _ENTRIES = {};\n(() =&gt; {\n  // webpackBootstrap\n})();\n\n(self[&quot;webpackChunk_N_E&quot;] = self[&quot;webpackChunk_N_E&quot;] || []).push([100], {\n\n  123: (() =&gt; {\n    // webpack chunk #123\n  }),\n  234: (() =&gt; {\n    // webpack chunk #234\n  }),\n  345: (() =&gt; {\n    // webpack chunk #345\n  }),\n\n  // …lots of webpack chunks…\n\n}, () =&gt; {\n  // webpackRuntimeModules\n}]);\n\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {\n    return _ENTRIES[&#039;some_function&#039;].default.call(request);\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>The script contains everything that&#39;s needed to deploy this function, and most of the logic exists in these webpack chunks, but that means that each function has a lot of code shared with its siblings. Quickly, you&#39;ll reach the 1MB limit, if you naively deployed all these functions together.</p><p>Our <code>@cloudflare/next-on-pages --experimental-minify</code> CLI argument deals with this problem by analyzing webpack chunks which are re-used in multiple places in this <code>.vercel/output/functions</code> directory and extracts out that code to a common place. This allows our compiler (esbuild) to efficiently combine this code, without duplicating it in all of these places. This process is experimental for the time being, while we look to make this as efficient as possible, without introducing any bugs as a result. Please <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/issues/\">file an issue on GitHub</a> if you notice any difference in behavior when using <code>--experimental-minify</code>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"whats-next\">What's next?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Pages Functions has been in beta for almost a year, and we&#39;re very excited to say that general availability is just around the corner. We&#39;re polishing off the last of the remaining features which includes analytics, logging, and billing. In fact, for billing, we recently made <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/billing/\">the announcement of how you&#39;ll be able to use the Workers Paid plan to remove the request limits of the Pages Functions beta from November 15</a>.</p><p>Finally, we&#39;re also looking at how we can bring Wasm support to Pages Functions which will unlock ever more use-cases for your full-stack applications. Stay tuned for more information on how we&#39;ll be offering this soon.</p><p>Try creating a Next.js Edge Runtime application and deploying it to Cloudflare Pages with the example above or by following <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-nextjs-site/\">the guide in our documentation</a>. Let us know if you have any questions or face any issues in <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/595317990191398933/910978223968518144\">Discord</a> or on <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/issues/\">GitHub</a>, and please report any quirks of the <code>--experimental-minify</code> argument. As always, we&#39;re excited to see what you build!</p>",
