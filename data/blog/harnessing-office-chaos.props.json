What was initially just a single species of physical entropy source – lava lamps – has grown and diversified. We want to catch you up a little on the story of LavaRand. This blog post will cover the new sources of “chaos” that have been added to LavaRand and how you can make use of that harnessed chaos in your next application. We’ll cover how public randomness can open up uses of publicly trusted randomness — imagine not needing to take the holders of a “random draw” at their word when they claim the outcome is not manipulated in some way. And finally we’ll discuss timelock encryption which is a way to ensure that a message cannot be decrypted until some chosen time in the future.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"lavarand-origins\">LavaRand origins</h2>\n      <a href=\"#lavarand-origins\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The entropy sourced from our wall of lava lamps in San Francisco has long played its part in the randomness that secures connections made through Cloudflare.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5XdIuQkEWKat2c9YanaCY0/aa873b127b5eea8cea19982f3552ccc2/image11-3.png\" alt=\"Lava lamps with flowing wax.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1612\" height=\"381\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Lava lamps with flowing wax.</p><p>Cloudflare’s servers collectively handle upwards of 55 million HTTP requests per second, the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#http-vs-https\">vast majority of which are secured via the TLS protocol</a> to ensure authenticity and confidentiality. Under the hood, cryptographic protocols like TLS require an underlying source of secure randomness – otherwise, the security guarantees fall apart.</p><p>Secure randomness used in cryptography needs to be computationally indistinguishable from “true” randomness. For this, it must both pass <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness_test\">statistical randomness tests</a>, and the output needs to be unpredictable to any computationally-bounded adversary, no matter how much previous output they’ve already seen. The typical way to achieve this is to take some random ‘seed’ and feed it into a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator\"><i>Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator</i></a> (CSPRNG) that can produce an essentially-endless stream of unpredictable bytes upon request. The properties of a CSPRNG ensure that all outputs are practically indistinguishable from truly random outputs to anyone that does not know its internal state. However, this all depends on having a secure random seed to begin with. Take a look at <a href=\"/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details\">this blog</a> for more details on true randomness versus pseudorandomness, and this blog for some great examples of <a href=\"/why-randomness-matters\">what can go wrong with insecure randomness</a>.</p><p>For many years, Cloudflare’s servers relied on local sources of entropy (such as the precise timing of packet arrivals or keyboard events) to seed their entropy pools. While there’s no reason to believe that the local entropy sources on those servers are insecure or could be easily compromised, we wanted to hedge our bets against that possibility. Our solution was to set up a system where our servers could periodically refresh their entropy pools with true randomness from an external source.</p><p>That brings us to LavaRand. “Lavarand” has long been the name given to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand\">systems used for the generation of randomness</a> (first by Silicon Graphics in 1997). Cloudflare <a href=\"/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production/\">launched its instantiation of a LavaRand</a> system in 2017 as a system that collects entropy from the wall of lava lamps in our San Francisco office and makes it available via an internal API. Our servers then periodically query the API to retrieve fresh randomness from LavaRand and incorporate it into their entropy pools. The contributions made by LavaRand can be considered spice added to the entropy pool mix! (For more technical details on <a href=\"/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details\">contributions made by LavaRand</a>, read our previous blog post.)</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1IPp9Lizp0pL83clLWGGNa/19d397787b5a5adbb337f581d9639fce/image10.jpg\" alt=\"Lava lamps in Cloudflare’s San Francisco office.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Lava lamps in Cloudflare’s San Francisco office.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"adding-to-the-office-chaos\">Adding to the office chaos</h2>\n      <a href=\"#adding-to-the-office-chaos\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Our lava lamps in San Francisco have been working tirelessly for years to supply fresh entropy to our systems, but they now have siblings across the world to help with their task!

As we’ve <a href=\"/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details\">previously described</a>, our servers periodically request fresh private randomness from LavaRand to help to update their entropy pools. Because of this, randomness from LavaRand is essentially available to the outside world! One easy way for developers to tap into private randomness from LavaRand is to use the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto/#methods\">Web Crypto API’s getRandomValues function</a> from a Cloudflare Worker, or use one that someone has already built, like <a href=\"https://csprng.xyz/\">csprng.xyz</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/ejcx/csprng.xyz\">source</a>).</p><p><b>Public randomness</b> consists of unpredictable and unbiased random values that are made available to everyone once they are published, and for this reason <b><i>should not be used for generating cryptographic keys</i></b>. The winning lottery numbers and the coin flip at the start of a sporting event are some examples of public random values. A double-headed coin would <i>not</i> be an unbiased and unpredictable source of entropy and would have drastic impacts on the sports betting world.</p><p>In addition to being unpredictable and unbiased, it’s also desirable for public randomness to be <i>trustworthy</i> so that consumers of the randomness are assured that the values were faithfully produced. Not many people would buy lottery tickets if they believed that the winning ticket was going to be chosen unfairly! Indeed, there are known cases of corrupt insiders subverting public randomness for personal gain, like the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/03/magazine/money-issue-iowa-lottery-fraud-mystery.html\">state lottery employee</a> who co-opted the lottery random number generator, allowing his friends and family to win millions of dollars.</p><p>A fundamental challenge of public randomness is that one must trust the authority producing the random outputs. Trusting a well-known authority like <a href=\"https://beacon.nist.gov/home\">NIST</a> may suffice for many applications, but could be problematic for others (especially for applications where decentralization is important).</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"drand-distributed-and-verifiable-public-randomness\">drand: distributed and verifiable public randomness</h2>\n      <a href=\"#drand-distributed-and-verifiable-public-randomness\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>To help solve this problem of trust, Cloudflare joined forces with seven other independent and geographically distributed organizations back in 2019 to form the <a href=\"/league-of-entropy/\">League of Entropy</a> to launch a public randomness beacon using the <a href=\"/inside-the-entropy\">drand</a> (pronounced dee-rand) protocol.

Decentralization ensures that one or two bad actors cannot subvert or bias the randomness beacon, and verifiability allows anyone to check that the random values are produced according to the drand protocol and with participation from a threshold (at least half, but usually more) of the participants in the drand network.

This creates a chain of randomness rounds all the way to the first “genesis” round. Chained randomness provides some nice properties for single-source randomness beacons, and is included as a requirement in <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons\">NIST’s spec for interoperable public randomness beacons</a>.</p><p>However, back in 2022 the drand team introduced the notion of <a href=\"https://drand.love/blog/2022/02/21/multi-frequency-support-and-timelock-encryption-capabilities/#unchained-randomness-timed-encryption\">unchained randomness</a>, where the message to be signed is <i>predictable</i> and doesn’t depend on any randomness from previous rounds, and showed that it provides the same security guarantees as chained randomness for the drand network (both require an honest threshold of nodes). In the implementation of unchained randomness in the <a href=\"https://drand.love/blog/2023/10/16/quicknet-is-live/\">quicknet</a>, the message to be signed simply consists of the round number.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"># chained randomness\nsignature = group_sign(round || previous_signature)\n\n# unchained randomness\nsignature = group_sign(round)</pre></code>\n            <p>Unchained randomness provides some powerful properties and usability improvements. In terms of usability, a consumer of the randomness beacon does not need to reconstruct the full chain of randomness to the genesis round to fully validate a particular round – the only information needed is the current round number and the group public key. This provides much more flexibility for clients, as they can choose how frequently they consume randomness rounds without needing to continuously follow the randomness chain.</p><p>Since the messages to be signed are known in advance (since they’re just the round number), unchained randomness also unlocks a powerful new property: timelock encryption.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5PVw1hyLALNYG3p20U2f2D/eeac0fd2fe805cabc1b75055cc0b0076/image7-7.png\" alt=\"Rotating double pendulums.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"381\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Rotating double pendulums.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"timelock-encryption\">Timelock encryption</h2>\n      <a href=\"#timelock-encryption\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Timelock (or “timed-release”) encryption is a method for encrypting a message such that it cannot be decrypted until a certain amount of time has passed.

An important observation is that since drand networks produce randomness at fixed intervals, each round in a drand beacon is closely tied to a specific timestamp (modulo small delays for the network to actually produce the beacon) which can be easily computed taking the beacon’s genesis timestamp and then adding the round number multiplied by the beacon’s period.</p><p>Once the round is decided upon, the properties of bilinear groups allow you to encrypt your message to some round with the drand beacon’s group public key.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">ciphertext = EncryptToRound(msg, round, beacon_public_key)</pre></code>\n            <p>After the nodes in the drand network cooperate to derive the randomness for the round (really, just the signature on the round number using the beacon’s group secret key), <i>anyone</i> can decrypt the ciphertext (this is where the magic of bilinear groups comes in).</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">random = Randomness(round)\nmessage = Decrypt(ciphertext,random)</pre></code>\n            <p>To make this practical, the timelocked message is actually the secret key for a symmetric scheme. This means that we encrypt the message with a symmetric key and encrypt the key with timelock, allowing for a decryption in the future.</p><p>Now, for a practical demonstration of timelock encryption, we use a tool that one of our own engineers built on top of Cloudflare Workers. The <a href=\"https://github.com/thibmeu/tlock-worker\">source code</a> is publicly available if you’d like to take a look under the hood at how it works.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\"># 1.
