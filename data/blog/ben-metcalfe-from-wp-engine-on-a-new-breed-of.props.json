With more than 11 years industry experience under his belt, Ben has previously spent time working on the development of MySpace and websites at the BBC.</p><p>He is the founder of two companies, Swordfish Corp and <a href=\"http://wpengine.com/\">WP Engine</a>. Having used the Internet since 1992, Ben is passionate about the Internet&#39;s ability to enrich, inform, educate and entertain our lives and connect us with others.</p><p>CloudFlare was lucky enough to catch up with Ben to hear the latest on his newest company, WP Engine.</p><p>&quot;We are one of a new breed of webhosts, we are a managed <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a> hosted platform,&quot; said Ben. &quot;What that means is we only support WordPress, we are not a traditional hosting account. You point a domain at our IP address, and we provide you an instant WordPress site that&#39;s running on our platform. We can immediately make sure that (your site) is set up in a way that is most optimum in way of speed, security, performance and scalability.&quot;</p><p>Having been around the Internet for some time, it&#39;s no surprise that Benis active in social media and encourages his company and staff to have asocial media presence.</p><p>&quot;We use Twitter a lot at WP Engine,&quot; said Ben. &quot;I think it&#39;s important that the business itself and my employees get their own following and reputation. It&#39;s a really tricky medium for support, but we use it to highlight and add value, encouraging customers through Twitter to use email support.&quot;</p><p>Ben&#39;s biggest mistake in social media? Not claiming @ben when he had the opportunity in 2006.</p><p>Listen in to hear the latest on WP Engine and what&#39;s next for the company.</p><p><i>At HostingCon 2012, </i><a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/\"><i>CloudFlare</i></a><i> co-founder </i><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/zatlyn\"><i>Michelle Zatlyn</i></a><i> sat down with 28 leading experts in the hosting industry. Their conversations were captured live and offer insight into the latest trends and news in hosting.</i></p>",
