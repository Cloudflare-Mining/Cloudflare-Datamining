Below, you can see how well our ML model recognized these requests as automated, before and after we updated the button, adding new rules. To keep things simple, we have shown only the top 5 bots by the volume of requests on the chart. With the introduction of our new managed rule, we have observed an improvement in our detection capabilities for the majority of these AI bots. Button v1 represents the old option that let customers block only verified AI crawlers, while Button v2 is the newly introduced feature that includes managed rule detections.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2CZVGyDCp9ZtMrZdIi49fE/aacd04d240e9348b5a9b65bad4b470e2/BLOG-2564_6.jpg\" alt=\"BLOG-2564 6\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1887\" height=\"1406\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>So how did we make our detections more robust? As we have mentioned before, sometimes <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-bot-management-machine-learning-and-more/\"><i><u>a single attribute can give a bot away</u></i></a>. We developed a sophisticated set of heuristics tailored to these AI bots, enabling us to effortlessly and accurately classify them as such. Although our ML model was already detecting the vast majority of these requests, the integration of additional heuristics has resulted in a noticeable increase in detection rates for each bot, and ensuring we score every request correctly 100% of the time. Transitioning from a purely machine learning approach to incorporating heuristics offers several advantages, including faster detection times and greater certainty in classification. While deploying a machine learning model is complex and time-consuming, new heuristics can be created in minutes. </p><p>The initial launch of the AI bots block button was well-received and is now used by over 133,000 websites, with significant adoption even among our Free tier customers. The newly updated button, launched on August 20, 2024, is rapidly gaining traction. Over 90,000 zones have already adopted the new rule, with approximately 240 new sites integrating it every hour. Overall, we are now helping to protect the intellectual property of more than 146,000 sites from AI bots, and we are currently blocking 66 million requests daily with this new rule. Additionally, we’re excited to announce that support for configuring AI bots protection via Terraform will be available by the end of this year, providing even more flexibility and control for managing your bot protection settings.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"bot-behavior\">Bot behavior</h3>\n      <a href=\"#bot-behavior\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>With the enhancements to our detection capabilities, it is essential to assess the impact of these changes to bot activity on the Internet.

User-agent matches are important to monitor because they indicate the bot is transparently announcing who they are when they’re crawling a website. </p><p>The graph below shows a volume of traffic we label as AI bot over the past two months. The blue line indicates the daily request count, while the red line represents the monthly average number of requests. In the past two months, we have seen an average reduction of nearly 30 million requests, with a decrease of 40 million in the most recent month.This decline coincides with the release of Button v1 and Button v2. Our hypothesis is that with the new AI bots blocking feature, Cloudflare is blocking a majority of these bots, which is discouraging them from crawling. </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/23ULxmxBIRskEONlWVIvlA/1dbd3d03239047492c2d4f7307217d97/BLOG-2564_7.jpg\" alt=\"BLOG-2564 7\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>This hypothesis is supported by the observed decline in requests from several top AI crawlers. Specifically, the Bytespider bot reduced its daily requests from approximately 100 million to just 50 million between the end of June and the end of August (see graph below). This reduction could be attributed to several factors, including our new AI bots block button and changes in the crawler&#39;s strategy.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5UwtyZSXULrVzIqLcICGKd/fdf02c15d17e1d7ed248ba5f8a97eb54/BLOG-2564_8.jpg\" alt=\"BLOG-2564 8\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"993\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>We have also observed an increase in the accountability of some AI crawlers. The most basic fingerprinting technique we use to identify AI bot looking for simple user-agent matches. User-agent matches are important to monitor because they indicate the bot is transparently announcing who they are when they’re crawling a website. These crawlers are now more frequently using their agents, reflecting a shift towards more transparent and responsible behavior. Notably, there has been a dramatic surge in the number of requests from the Perplexity user agent. This increase might be linked to <a href=\"https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/\">previous accusations<u> </u></a>that Perplexity did not properly present its user agent, which could have prompted a shift in their approach to ensure better identification and compliance. </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7Hq2vUMqqdNCyaxNTCg3JD/610ad53d57203203c5176229245c8086/BLOG-2564_9.jpg\" alt=\"BLOG-2564 9\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"991\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>These trends suggest that our updates are likely affecting how AI crawlers interact with content. We will continue to monitor AI bot activity to help users control who accesses their content and how. By keeping a close watch on emerging patterns, we aim to provide users with the tools and insights needed to make informed decisions about managing their traffic. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"wrap-up\">Wrap up</h2>\n      <a href=\"#wrap-up\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We’re excited to continue to explore the AI landscape, whether we’re finding more ways to make the Cloudflare dashboard usable or new threats to guard against.
