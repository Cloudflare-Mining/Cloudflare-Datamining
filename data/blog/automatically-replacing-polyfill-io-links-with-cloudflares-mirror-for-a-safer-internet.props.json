This is a real threat to the Internet at large given the popularity of this library.</p><p>We have, over the last 24 hours, released an automatic JavaScript URL rewriting service that will rewrite any link to polyfill.io found in a website proxied by Cloudflare <a href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/\">to a link to our mirror under cdnjs</a>. This will avoid breaking site functionality while mitigating the risk of a supply chain attack.</p><p>Any website on the free plan has this feature automatically activated now.

We have asked them to remove the false statement, and they have, so far, ignored our requests. This is yet another warning sign that they cannot be trusted.</p><p>If you are not using Cloudflare today, we still highly recommend that you remove any use of polyfill.io and/or find an alternative solution. And, while the automatic replacement function will handle most cases, the best practice is to remove polyfill.io from your projects and replace it with a secure alternative mirror like Cloudflare’s even if you are a customer.</p><p>You can do this by searching your code repositories for instances of polyfill.io and replacing it with <a href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/\">cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/</a> (Cloudflare’s mirror). This is a non-breaking change as the two URLs will serve the same polyfill content.

This led us to spin up our own mirror of the polyfill.io code hosted under cdnjs, a JavaScript library repository sponsored by Cloudflare.</p><p>The new owner was unknown in the industry and did not have a track record of trust to administer a project such as polyfill.io. The concern, <a href=\"https://x.com/triblondon/status/1761852117579427975\">highlighted even by the original author</a>, was that if they were to abuse polyfill.io by injecting additional code to the library, it could cause far-reaching security problems on the Internet affecting several hundreds of thousands websites. Or it could be used to perform a targeted supply-chain attack against specific websites.</p><p>Unfortunately, that worry came true on June 25, 2024, as the polyfill.io service was being used to inject nefarious code that, under certain circumstances, redirected users to other websites.</p><p>We have taken the exceptional step of using our ability to modify HTML on the fly to replace references to the polyfill.io CDN in our customers’ websites with links to our own, safe, mirror created back in February.</p><p>In the meantime, additional threat feed providers have also taken the decision to <a href=\"https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/commit/91dfc54aed0f0aa514c1a481c3e63ea16da94c03\">flag the domain as malicious</a>. We have not outright blocked the domain through any of the mechanisms we have because we are concerned it could cause widespread web outages given how broadly polyfill.io is used with some estimates indicating <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-polyfillio\">usage on nearly 4% of all websites</a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"corroborating-data-with-page-shield\">Corroborating data with Page Shield</h3>\n            <a href=\"#corroborating-data-with-page-shield\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The original report indicates that malicious code was injected that, under certain circumstances, would redirect users to betting sites.

This has been made possible by leveraging <a href=\"/rust-nginx-module\">ROFL (Response Overseer for FL)</a>. ROFL powers various Cloudflare products that need to alter HTML as it streams, such as <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/fonts/\">Cloudflare Fonts,</a> <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/email-address-obfuscation/\">Email Obfuscation</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/rocket-loader/\">Rocket Loader</a></p><p>ROFL is developed entirely in Rust. The memory-safety features of Rust are indispensable for ensuring protection against memory leaks while processing a staggering volume of requests, measuring in the millions per second. Rust&#39;s compiled nature allows us to finely optimize our code for specific hardware configurations, delivering performance gains compared to interpreted languages.</p><p>The performance of ROFL allows us to rewrite HTML on-the-fly and modify the polyfill.io links quickly, safely, and efficiently. This speed helps us reduce any additional latency added by processing the HTML file.</p><p>If the feature is turned on, for any HTTP response with an HTML Content-Type, we parse all JavaScript script tag source attributes. If any are found linking to polyfill.io, we rewrite the src attribute to link to our mirror instead. We map to the correct version of the polyfill service while the query string is left untouched.</p><p>The logic will not activate if a Content Security Policy (CSP) header is found in the response. This ensures we don’t replace the link while breaking the CSP policy and therefore potentially breaking the website.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"default-on-for-free-customers-optional-for-everyone-else\">Default on for free customers, optional for everyone else</h3>\n            <a href=\"#default-on-for-free-customers-optional-for-everyone-else\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Cloudflare proxies millions of websites, and a large portion of these sites are on our free plan.
