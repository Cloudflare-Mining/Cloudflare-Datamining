From the way we shop online, engage with our communities, access critical healthcare resources, sustain the worldwide digital economy, and beyond. Our dependence on the Internet has led to cyber attacks that are bigger and more widespread than ever, worsening the so-called defender’s dilemma: attackers only need to succeed once, while defenders must succeed every time.</p><p>In the past year alone, we <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2024-q4/\"><u>discovered and mitigated the largest DDoS attack</u></a> ever recorded in the history of the Internet – three different times – underscoring the rapid and persistent efforts of threat actors. We helped <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/elections-2024-internet/\"><u>safeguard the largest year of elections</u></a> across the globe, with more than half the world’s population eligible to vote, all while witnessing geopolitical tensions and war reflected in the digital world.</p><p>2025 already promises to follow suit, with cyberattacks estimated to cost the global economy $10.5 trillion in 2025. As the rapid advancement of <a href=\"https://x.com/i/grok?text=AI%20advancements\">AI</a> and emerging technologies increases, and as threat actors become more agile and creative, the security landscape continues to drastically evolve. Organizations now face a higher volume of attacks, and an influx of more complex threats that carry real-world consequences, such as state-sponsored cyber attacks and assaults on critical infrastructure. </p><p>My job is to protect Cloudflare as an organization and support our customers in staying one step ahead of threat actors. While every week is a security week at Cloudflare, it’s time to ship — that’s what Innovation Weeks are all about! Welcome to Security Week 2025.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"my-perspective-on-the-security-landscape\">My perspective on the security landscape</h2>\n      <a href=\"#my-perspective-on-the-security-landscape\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>As CSO, I have the privilege of collaborating with world-class security leaders who are navigating the dynamic threat and regulatory landscape. Through meaningful exchanges at forums like the World Economic Forum at Davos, RSA, and Black Hat, I&#39;ve gained useful perspectives on the shared difficulties we encounter while handling today’s security needs:</p><ul><li><p><b>Complexity: </b>Complexity has become the enemy of security. Teams are struggling with fragmented technology stacks, multi-cloud environments and continued gaps in security talent. Situational awareness is limited, disparate systems increase operational overhead, and the ability to modernize becomes daunting.</p></li><li><p><b>Artificial Intelligence: </b>AI presents both opportunity and risk. Organizations are racing to leverage AI faster than they can train their workforce on how to mitigate the unique risks it introduces. Security teams are being asked to secure AI models to protect sensitive data and support operational stability, all on constrained budgets and resources.</p></li><li><p><b>Security blind spots: </b>The attack surface continues to expand. With remote work, cloud migration, and the acceleration of digital transformation, security teams struggle to maintain visibility across increasingly distributed environments. This expansion has created blind spots that sophisticated threat actors are quick to exploit.</p></li><li><p><b>Trusted vendors: </b>Supply chain security incidents increase year over year. Recent high-profile incidents have demonstrated how vulnerabilities in third-party components can cascade through the digital ecosystem. Security teams must account for risks far beyond their immediate perimeter, extending to every dependency in their technology stack.</p></li><li><p><b>Detection velocity: </b>The time it takes to detect a threat actor in your environment remains too long. Despite investments in monitoring and detection technologies, the average dwell time for attackers still exceeds industry targets. Security leaders express frustration that sophisticated adversaries can operate undetected within networks for extended periods of time.</p></li></ul><p>What&#39;s clear across the security community is that the traditional approach of layering point solutions is not sustainable. Security leaders need integrated platforms that reduce complexity while providing comprehensive protection and visibility. This is precisely <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-i-joined-cloudflare-as-chief-security-officer/\"><u>why I joined Cloudflare nearly two years ago</u></a> — to help build innovative solutions for today’s threat landscape and the future, not the threat landscape from five years ago.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"security-week-priorities-in-2025\">Security Week priorities in 2025</h2>\n      <a href=\"#security-week-priorities-in-2025\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Over the following week we will showcase innovation that will help security practitioners solve the challenges faced every day.

By leveraging our network footprint, customers will have a comprehensive view of cyber threats based on attacks occurring across the Internet. </p><p>This product will enable users to self-serve with contextual insights into attacks occurring on the Internet, enhancing their ability to proactively adjust defenses and respond to emerging threats. As security practitioners, stopping threats at the gate isn’t enough — we need to be ahead of the next vector. The Threat Events feed provides that additional layer of forensic analysis to give us that edge — dissecting the who, how, and why behind each attack.
