This marks the most extensive election cycle worldwide until the year 2048. Elections are a cornerstone of democracy, providing citizens with the means to shape their government, hold leaders accountable, and participate in the political process.</p><p>At Cloudflare, we’ve been supporting state and local governments that run elections for free for the last seven years. As we look at the upcoming elections around the world, we are reminded how important our services are in keeping information related to elections reliable and secure from those looking to disrupt these processes. Unfortunately, the problems that election officials face in keeping elections secure has only gotten more complicated and requires facilitating information sharing, capacity building, and joint efforts to safeguard democratic processes.</p><p>At Cloudflare, we support a range of players in the election space by providing security, performance, and reliability tools to help facilitate the democratic process. With <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/impact/\">Cloudflare Impact projects,</a> we have found a way to protect a range of stakeholders who play an important role in the election process and better prepare them for the unexpected. As we have grown our various Impact projects to protect more than 2,900 domains, we have learned how best to protect vulnerable groups online.</p><p>During Security Week, we want to provide a look at how we are preparing groups that work in elections around the world for 2024, as well as exploring emerging threat trends.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"a-look-at-the-year-ahead\">A look at the year ahead</h3>\n      <a href=\"#a-look-at-the-year-ahead\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-government/\">State and local governments</a> play a critical role in various aspects of the election process. From voter registration to candidate filing, polling place setup, distribution of ballots, tabulations of voters, and reporting of election results, they ensure that elections are conducted fairly, securely, and efficiently.</p><p>If we have learned anything from the last seven years, it is that election officials have even more on their plate when it comes to conducting free and fair elections. Countries conducting elections this year are likely to face a complicated array of threats, from voter manipulation to physical violence. Unfortunately, in many countries, people have been blamed for election results that displeased certain politicians and constituents, and numerous election officials have encountered death threats, online harassment, and mistreatment. In April 2023, the <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-shows-high-turnover-amid-safety-threats-and\">Brennan Center found that 45%</a> of local election officials said they fear for the safety of their colleagues.</p><p>When it comes to safeguarding online infrastructure, securing voter registration systems, ensuring the integrity of election-related information, and planning effective incident response are necessary as online threats grow more and more sophisticated. For example, in the three months leading up to the 2022 US midterm elections, <a href=\"/securing-the-inboxes-of-democracy/\">Cloudflare prevented around 150,000 phishing emails</a> targeting campaign officials.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-we-use-our-services-to-promote-free-and-fair-elections\">How we use our services to promote free and fair elections</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-we-use-our-services-to-promote-free-and-fair-elections\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The core principle driving our work in the election space is the idea that access to accurate voting information, as provided by state and local governments, is fundamental to the proper functioning of democracy. We see ourselves as one piece of a larger puzzle when it comes to safeguarding elections.</p><p>Protecting election entities is an enormous task, and there is strength in partnerships that provide with a broad range of roles and expertise. We have seen groups such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-security-2024-voting-cybersecurity-8bda7ab6b3f921d363ab3257fd4b378b\">increase their role in boosting election security</a> efforts throughout the last few years. There have been partnerships between governments, organizations, and private companies assisting election officials with the tools and expertise on the best ways to secure the democratic process.</p><p>In 2020, <a href=\"/cloudflares-athenian-project-expands-internationally\">we partnered</a> with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems to find a way to expand our protections to election management bodies outside the United States. In our partnership, we have been able to provide our Enterprise-level services to six election management bodies, including the Central Election Commission of Kosovo, State Election Commission of North Macedonia, and many local election bodies in Canada.</p><blockquote><p><i>“Cloudflare is a technology enabler for the State Election Committee (SEC) in North Macedonia, and its tools help us ensure that early election results will be accessible to the general population, thus promoting visibility and transparency.”</i><i><b>- Vladislav Bidikov,</b></i> <i>Cybersecurity Task Force Member, State Election Commission of North Macedonia</i>        </p></blockquote>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"internet-trends-during-elections\">Internet trends during elections</h3>\n      <a href=\"#internet-trends-during-elections\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Looking at Internet trends during elections, we have seen in several countries that Internet traffic typically drops during the day, when people are going to the polling booths.

We look forward to learning more about threats to these groups and how our products can help keep their internal data safe from attacks.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"super-tuesday\">Super Tuesday</h3>\n      <a href=\"#super-tuesday\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5KYvGOgAoSDgn1qEo3MyTz/cf9423e6ec90213bc597e7b15b2d2c7e/image11-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"451\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Because Super Tuesday in the United States involves several states, including California, Alabama, Iowa, North Carolina, and more, that hold their primaries or caucuses on the same day, it is often seen as a critical turning point in the presidential primary process.</p><p>On March 6, 2024, <a href=\"https://therecord.media/cisa-no-credible-threats-to-super-tuesday-voting\">CISA reported</a> there had been no credible digital threats to Super Tuesday, to the relief of many security experts.
