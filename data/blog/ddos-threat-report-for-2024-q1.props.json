A DDoS attack, short for <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\">Distributed Denial of Service attack</a>, is a type of cyber attack that aims to take down or disrupt Internet services such as websites or mobile apps and make them unavailable for users.

Cloudflare’s systems automatically detected and mitigated the attack.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/\">Mirai botnet</a>, infamous for its massive DDoS attacks, was primarily composed of infected IoT devices. It notably disrupted Internet access across the US in 2016 by targeting DNS service providers. Almost eight years later, Mirai attacks are still very common. Four out of every 100 HTTP DDoS attacks, and two out of every 100 L3/4 DDoS attacks are launched by a Mirai-variant botnet.

Among the top growing attack vectors (emerging threats), Jenkins Flood experienced the largest growth of over 826% QoQ.</p><p>Jenkins Flood is a DDoS attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the <a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/\">Jenkins automation server</a>, specifically through UDP multicast/broadcast and DNS multicast services. Attackers can send small, specially crafted requests to a publicly facing UDP port on Jenkins servers, causing them to respond with disproportionately large amounts of data. This can amplify the traffic volume significantly, overwhelming the target&#39;s network and leading to service disruption. Jenkins addressed this vulnerability (<a href=\"https://smartermsp.com/cybersecurity-threat-advisory-0013-20-jenkins-udp-ddos-attack-cve-2020-2100/\">CVE-2020-2100</a>) in 2020 by disabling these services by default in later versions.

This attack vector is made possible by a vulnerability that was <a href=\"https://nowotarski.info/http2-continuation-flood-technical-details/\">discovered and reported publicly by researcher Bartek Nowotarski</a> on April 3, 2024.</p><p>The HTTP/2 Continuation Flood vulnerability targets HTTP/2 protocol implementations that improperly handle HEADERS and multiple CONTINUATION frames. The threat actor sends a sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS flag, leading to potential server issues such as out-of-memory crashes or CPU exhaustion. HTTP/2 Continuation Flood allows even a single machine to disrupt websites and APIs using HTTP/2, with the added challenge of difficult detection due to no visible requests in HTTP access logs.</p><p>This vulnerability poses a potentially severe threat more damaging than the previously known <a href=\"/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/\">HTTP/2 Rapid Reset</a>, which resulted in some of the largest HTTP/2 DDoS attack campaigns in recorded history. During that campaign, thousands of hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks targeted Cloudflare. The attacks were multi-million requests per second strong. The average attack rate in that campaign, recorded by Cloudflare, was 30M rps. Approximately 89 of the attacks peaked above 100M rps and the largest one we saw hit 201M rps.
