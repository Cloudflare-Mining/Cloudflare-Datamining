Our <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-first-2024-us-presidential-debate-influenced-internet-traffic-and-security-trends\">earlier analysis</a> covered email trends involving “Joe Biden” or “Donald Trump” since January, concluding just after the Biden-Trump <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-first-2024-us-presidential-debate-influenced-internet-traffic-and-security-trends\">debate</a> in late June. From June 1, 2024, through August 21, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/\">Cloudflare’s Cloud Email Security</a> service processed around 14 million emails that included the names “Donald Trump”, “Joe Biden”, or “Kamala Harris” in the subject, with 7.4 million referencing Trump.</p><p>The next chart highlights a surge in emails mentioning Trump in mid-July, contrasting with a drop of emails mentioning Biden in the subject, who saw a brief uptick on July 22-23 following his withdrawal from the race, and on August 20, the day after his DNC speech.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7yEc8RR7awFKzK8a4rHeCA/d6767f764dc9cdd7dafebc5b2779f46c/Screenshot-2024-08-23-at-12.02.42.png.crdownload\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2072\" height=\"602\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p></p><p>Focusing on the period since July 21 – when changes in the presumptive Democratic candidate occurred – over 3.2 million emails mentioned “Donald Trump”, around 1.2 million mentioned “Joe Biden”, and over 2 million mentioned “Kamala Harris” in the subject. Examining spam and phishing messages, 34% of emails with Trump’s name were spam, and 3% were malicious. For Kamala Harris, 0.8% were spam and 0.2% were malicious, while Biden’s figures were 1.1% for spam and 0.1% for malicious.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4HGaebyHPR9jp7G6DfYC21/834fe5b8bf5e831befe8a2bb06771a06/1000-9.png\" alt=\"1000-9\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1824\" height=\"608\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p></p><p>To better understand the elevated percentages of spam and malicious emails mentioning “Donald Trump,” it’s important to look at the trend over time. Notably, after July 15, there was a significant rise in all emails mentioning Trump in the subject, as the previous line chart also shows, and that also included a higher percentage of emails classified as spam.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/Fh5yqhrivXQGpN9LrMNk5/5565b59c1ed0127b12a094edc1fd01c0/1000-10.png\" alt=\"1000-10\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2030\" height=\"596\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Additionally, Republican Vice Presidential Candidate JD Vance and Democratic Vice Presidential Candidate Tim Walz also influenced email trends. JD Vance was announced as Donald Trump’s running mate on July 15, so we start there – Tim Walz’s announcement came later, on August 6. Emails with “Tim Walz” mentioned in the subject (over 530,000) outnumbered those with “JD Vance” (over 241,000). Spam made up 1% of emails with Vance’s name and 0.1% were malicious, and for Walz, 0.7% were spam and 0.03% malicious.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1hV9KPjdHaeliYvafhi6KK/4811276c824d3e2ebb600f2817231b7a/1000-11.png\" alt=\"1000-11\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1772\" height=\"606\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"conclusion-high-intensity-election-year\">Conclusion: high intensity election year</h2>\n      <a href=\"#conclusion-high-intensity-election-year\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In this analysis of the Democratic National Convention, we’ve observed trends similar to those seen during the Republican National Convention.
