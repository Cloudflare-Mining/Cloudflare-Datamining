Last month this changed - I became fascinated with the promise of this data structure, but I quickly realized it had some drawbacks. This blog post is the tale of my brief love affair with Bloom filters.</p><p>While doing research about <a href=\"/the-root-cause-of-large-ddos-ip-spoofing/\">IP spoofing</a>, I needed to examine whether the source IP addresses extracted from packets reaching our servers were legitimate, depending on the geographical location of our data centers. For example, source IPs belonging to a legitimate Italian ISP should not arrive in a Brazilian datacenter. This problem might sound simple, but in the ever-evolving landscape of the internet this is far from easy. Suffice it to say I ended up with many large text files with data like this:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4EyhhPLD0IymvVMr3R8pMz/2c30f18b77fdee9184c438f80e94781b/Screenshot-from-2020-03-01-23-57-10.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-from-2020-03-01-23-57-10\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"634\" height=\"176\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This reads as: the IP 192.0.2.1 was recorded reaching Cloudflare data center number 107 with a legitimate request. This data came from many sources, including our active and passive probes, logs of certain domains we own (like cloudflare.com), public sources (like BGP table), etc. The same line would usually be repeated across multiple files.</p><p>I ended up with a gigantic collection of data of this kind. At some point I counted 1 billion lines across all the harvested sources. I usually write bash scripts to pre-process the inputs, but at this scale this approach wasn&#39;t working. For example, removing duplicates from this tiny file of a meager 600MiB and 40M lines, took... about an eternity:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7lzqpR8gHJRr6XC4fbcepJ/91185ef0b6036ecd484bd791f5a72651/Screenshot-from-2020-03-01-23-25-19a.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-from-2020-03-01-23-25-19a\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"800\" height=\"126\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Enough to say that deduplicating lines using the usual bash commands like &#39;sort&#39; in various configurations (see &#39;--parallel&#39;, &#39;--buffer-size&#39; and &#39;--unique&#39;) was not optimal for such a large data set.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"bloom-filters-to-the-rescue\">Bloom filters to the rescue</h2>\n            <a href=\"#bloom-filters-to-the-rescue\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/vR5EB9TdKmVJDjStuvpwL/fe51959f24694cc5c072f3263aa42ab0/Bloom_filter.png\" alt=\"Bloom_filter\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"649\" height=\"233\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter#/media/File:Bloom_filter.svg\">Image</a> by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:David_Eppstein\">David Eppstein</a> Public Domain</p><p>Then I had a brainwave - it&#39;s not necessary to sort the lines! I just need to remove duplicated lines - using some kind of &quot;set&quot; data structure should be much faster. Furthermore, I roughly know the cardinality of the input file (number of unique lines), and I can live with some data points being lost - using a probabilistic data structure is fine!</p><p>Bloom-filters are a perfect fit!</p><p>While you should go and read <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter#Algorithm_description\">Wikipedia on Bloom Filters</a>, here is how I look at this data structure.</p><p>How would you implement a &quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)\">set</a>&quot;? Given a perfect hash function, and infinite memory, we could just create an infinite bit array and set a bit number &#39;hash(item)&#39; for each item we encounter. This would give us a perfect &quot;set&quot; data structure. Right? Trivial. Sadly, hash functions have collisions and infinite memory doesn&#39;t exist, so we have to compromise in our reality. But we can calculate and manage the probability of collisions. For example, imagine we have a good hash function, and 128GiB of memory. We can calculate the probability of the second item added to the bit array colliding would be 1 in 1099511627776. The probability of collision when adding more items worsens as we fill up the bit array.</p><p>Furthermore, we could use more than one hash function, and end up with a denser bit array. This is exactly what Bloom filters optimize for. A Bloom filter is a bunch of math on top of the four variables:</p><ul><li><p>&#39;n&#39; - The number of input elements (cardinality)</p></li><li><p>&#39;m&#39; - Memory used by the bit-array</p></li><li><p>&#39;k&#39; - Number of hash functions counted for each input</p></li><li><p>&#39;p&#39; - Probability of a false positive match</p></li></ul><p>Given the &#39;n&#39; input cardinality and the &#39;p&#39; desired probability of false positive, the Bloom filter math returns the &#39;m&#39; memory required and &#39;k&#39; number of hash functions needed.</p><p>Check out this excellent visualization by Thomas Hurst showing how parameters influence each other:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://hur.st/bloomfilter/\">https://hur.st/bloomfilter/</a></p></li></ul>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"mmuniq-bloom\">mmuniq-bloom</h2>\n            <a href=\"#mmuniq-bloom\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Guided by this intuition, I set out on a journey to add a new tool to my toolbox - &#39;mmuniq-bloom&#39;, a probabilistic tool that, given input on STDIN, returns only unique lines on STDOUT, hopefully much faster than &#39;sort&#39; + &#39;uniq&#39; combo!</p><p>Here it is:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2020-02-mmuniq/mmuniq-bloom.c\">&#39;mmuniq-bloom.c&#39;</a></p></li></ul><p>For simplicity and speed I designed &#39;mmuniq-bloom&#39; with a couple of assumptions. First, unless otherwise instructed, it uses 8 hash functions k=8. This seems to be a close to optimal number for the data sizes I&#39;m working with, and the hash function can quickly output 8 decent hashes. Then we align &#39;m&#39;, number of bits in the bit array, to be a power of two. This is to avoid the pricey % modulo operation, which compiles down to slow assembly &#39;div&#39;. With power-of-two sizes we can just do bitwise AND.

I&#39;m using a pretty non-trivial &#39;siphash24&#39; hash function, so it surely burns the CPU, right?

Let&#39;s do the math: 40 million lines, 8 hashes counted for each line. Since our Bloom filter is 128MiB, on <a href=\"/gen-x-performance-tuning/\">our older hardware</a> it doesn&#39;t fit into L3 cache! The hashes are uniformly distributed across the large memory range - each hash generates a memory miss.

The real program is faster, taking only 12s. This is because, although the Bloom filter data does not completely fit into L3 cache, it still gets some benefit from caching. It&#39;s easy to see with &#39;perf stat -d&#39;:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7pgVS7zKpVhueO7rAhQDRI/5145db41e7b06f5875d1da4adfa92142/image9.png\" alt=\"image9\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1214\" height=\"568\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Right, so we should have had at least 320M LLC-load-misses, but we had only 280M. This still doesn&#39;t explain why the program was running only 12 seconds. But it doesn&#39;t really matter. What matters is that the number of cache misses is a real problem and we can only fix it by reducing the number of memory accesses. Let&#39;s try tuning Bloom filter to use only one hash function:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/30BFuINOqYvVgCCdYXCzUB/0893742e7bc41b923af6e67f53629049/image12.png\" alt=\"image12\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1174\" height=\"156\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Ouch! That really hurt! The Bloom filter required 64 GiB of memory to get our desired false positive probability ratio of 1-error-per-10k-lines. This is terrible!</p><p>Also, it doesn&#39;t seem like we improved much. It took the OS 22 seconds to prepare memory for us, but we still burned 11 seconds in userspace. I guess this time any benefits from hitting memory less often were offset by lower cache-hit probability due to drastically increased memory size. In previous runs we required only 128MiB for the Bloom filter!</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"dumping-bloom-filters-altogether\">Dumping Bloom filters altogether</h2>\n            <a href=\"#dumping-bloom-filters-altogether\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>This is getting ridiculous.

This gives us much stronger probability guarantees, with probability of false positives much better than one error in 10k lines.</p><p>Let&#39;s do the math. Adding a new item to a hash table containing, say 40M, entries has &#39;40M/2^64&#39; chances of hitting a hash collision. This is about one in 461 billion - a reasonably low probability. But we are not adding one item to a pre-filled set! Instead we are adding 40M lines to the initially empty set. As per <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem\">birthday paradox</a> this has much higher chances of hitting a collision at some point. A decent approximation is &#39;n^2/2m&#39;, which in our case is &#39;(40M<sup>2)/(2*(2</sup>64))&#39;. This is a chance of one in 23000. In other words, assuming we are using good hash function, every one in 23 thousand random sets of 40M items, will have a hash collision. This practical chance of hitting a collision is non-negligible, but it&#39;s still better than a Bloom filter and totally acceptable for my use case.</p><p>The hash table code runs faster, has better memory access patterns and better false positive probability than the Bloom filter approach.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7i3tnYhlVqJ7NEfutgywVD/dafe27be80727cd61533f548457bc4a3/image7.png\" alt=\"image7\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1160\" height=\"190\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Don&#39;t be scared about the &quot;hash conflicts&quot; line, it just indicates how full the hash table was.

This is fine and, since we iterate over the buckets in linear order, we can expect the memory to be nicely prefetched.</p><p>From the previous exercise we know our hash function takes about 2 seconds of this.

Frankly - in most cases it doesn&#39;t matter. The cost of counting even complex hash functions like &#39;siphash24&#39; is small compared to the cost of random memory access. In our case simplifying the hash function will bring only small benefits.
