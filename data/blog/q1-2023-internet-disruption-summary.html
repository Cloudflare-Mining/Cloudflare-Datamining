	<p>Cloudflare operates in more than 285 cities in over 100 countries, where we interconnect with over 11,500 network providers in order to provide a broad range of services to millions of customers. The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions.</p>
	<p>We entered 2023 with Internet disruptions due to causes that ran the gamut, including several government-directed Internet shutdowns, cyclones, a massive earthquake, power outages, cable cuts, cyberattacks, technical problems, and military action. As we have noted in the past, this post is intended as a summary overview of observed disruptions, and is not an exhaustive or complete list of issues that have occurred during the quarter.</p>
	<h2 id="government-directed">Government directed</h2>
	<h3 id="iran">Iran</h3>
	<p>Over the last six-plus months, government-directed Internet shutdowns in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ir" target="_blank">Iran</a> have largely been in response to protests over the death of Mahsa Amini while in police custody. While these shutdowns are still occurring in a limited fashion, a notable shutdown observed in January was intended to <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1616061427948699648" target="_blank">prevent cheating on academic exams</a>. Internet shutdowns with a similar purpose have been observed across a number of other countries, and have also <a href="https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-cuts-internet-access-to-prevent-cheating-in-university-exams/30058425.html" target="_blank">occurred in Iran in the past</a>. Access was restricted across <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as44244" target="_blank">AS44244 (Irancell)</a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as197207" target="_blank">AS197207 (MCCI)</a>, with lower traffic levels observed in Alborz Province, Fars, Khuzestan, and Razavi Khorasan between 08:00 to 11:30 local time (04:30 to 08:00 UTC) on January 19.</p>

	<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1637126453320994816" target="_blank">shutdown of mobile Internet connectivity</a> in Punjab, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/in" target="_blank">India</a> began on March 19, ordered by the local government amid concerns of protest-related violence. Although the initial shutdown was ordered to take place between March 18, 12:00 local time and March 19, 12:00 local time, it was extended several times, ultimately lasting for three days. Traffic for <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as38266" target="_blank">AS38266 (Vodafone India)</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as45271" target="_blank">AS45271 (Idea Cellular Limited</a>), <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as45609" target="_blank">AS45609 (Bharti Mobility)</a>, and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as55836" target="_blank">AS55836 (Reliance Jio Infocomm)</a> began to fall around 12:30 local time (07:00 UTC) on March 18, recovering around 12:30 local time (07:00 UTC) on March 21. However, it was <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/amritpal-crackdown-mobile-internet-services-restored-sangrur-moga-suspended-tarn-taran-ferozepur-8514057" target="_blank">subsequently reported</a> that connectivity remained shut down in some districts until March 23 or 24.</p>

During the last couple of days in February, a few small outages were observed on CANTV’s network in several Venezuelan states. However, a more significant near-complete outage <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1630623104790675471" target="_blank">occurred on February 28</a>, starting around midnight local time (04:00 UTC), and lasting for the better part of the day, with traffic recovering at 17:30 local time (21:30 UTC). A <a href="https://twitter.com/salaprensaCantv/status/1630584346200424450" target="_blank">Tweet posted the morning of February 28 by CANTV</a> referenced an outage in their fiber optic network, which was presumably the cause.</p>

	<h2 id="power-outages">Power outages</h2>
	<h3 id="pakistan">Pakistan</h3>
	<p>A <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/power-outage-plunges-pakistan-into-darkness/a-64484771" target="_blank">country-wide power outage</a> in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/pk" target="_blank">Pakistan</a> on January 23 impacted more than 220 million people, and resulted in a significant drop in Internet traffic <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1617506479296188416" target="_blank">being observed</a> in the country. The power outage began at 07:34 local time (02:34 UTC), with Internet traffic starting to drop almost immediately. The figure below shows that traffic volumes dropped as much as 50% from normal levels before recovering around 04:15 local time on January 24 (23:15 UTC on January 23). This power outage was reportedly due to a “sudden drop in the frequency of the power transmission system”, which led to a “widespread breakdown”. Nationwide power outages have also occurred in Pakistan in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/10/pakistan-power-gradually-being-restored-after-nationwide-blackout" target="_blank">January 2021</a>, <a href="https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/05/16/technical-fault-at-tarbela-leaves-several-cities-without-electricity" target="_blank">May 2018</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/25/massive-power-failure-plunges-80-of-pakistan-into-darkness" target="_blank">January 2015</a>.</p>

BELCO’s tweet was posted at 16:10 local time (20:10 UTC), approximately one hour after a <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1621616687240953856" target="_blank">significant drop was observed</a> in Bermuda’s Internet traffic. The power outage, and subsequent Internet disruption, lasted over five hours, as BELCO <a href="https://twitter.com/BELCOBERMUDA/status/1621690284311515137" target="_blank">later tweeted</a> that “<em>As of 9.45 pm [00:45 UTC, February 4], all circuits have been restored.</em>”</p>

	<h3 id="turkey">Turkey</h3>
	<p>On February 5, a <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000jllz/executive" target="_blank">magnitude 7.8 earthquake</a> occurred 23 km east of Nurdağı, Turkey, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/05/europe/earthquake-hits-turkey-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">leaving many thousands dead and injured</a>. The quake, which occurred at 04:17 local time (01:17 UTC), was believed to be the strongest to hit Turkey since 1939. The widespread damage and destruction resulted in significant disruptions to Internet connectivity in multiple areas of the country, as shown in the figures below. Although Internet traffic volumes were relatively low because it was so early in the morning, the graphs show it <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1622560385411825665" target="_blank">dropping even further</a> at or around the time of the earthquake. Nearly half a day later, traffic volumes in selected locations were between 63-94% lower than at the same time the previous week. A month later, after several aftershocks, <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1633145887961542662" target="_blank">traffic volumes had mostly recovered</a>, although some regions were still struggling to recover.</p>

However, full restoration of services across all of RSAWEB’s impacted platforms took a full week, according to a February 8 <a href="https://twitter.com/RSAWEB/status/1623254114057478145" target="_blank">tweet</a>.</p>

	<p>An unspecified “international interconnectivity problem” impacting Telecom Italia caused a <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1622253904036597760" target="_blank">multi-hour Internet disruption</a> in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/it" target="_blank">Italy</a> on February 5. At a country level, a nominal drop in traffic is visible in the figure below starting around 11:45 local time (10:45 UTC) with some volatility visible in the lower traffic through 17:15 local time (16:15 UTC). However, the impact of the problem is more obvious in the traffic graphs for <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as3269" target="_blank">AS3269</a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as16232" target="_blank">AS16232</a>, both owned by Telecom Italia. Both graphs show a more significant loss of traffic, as well as greater volatility through the five-plus hour disruption.</p>

The impact of this disruption is clearly visible at a <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/cg" target="_blank">country</a> level, with <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1635969801859260419" target="_blank">traffic dropping sharply</a> at 00:45 local time (23:45 on March 14 UTC), driven by complete outages at <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as37463" target="_blank">MTN Congo</a> and Congo Telecom, as seen in the graphs below. While traffic at MTN Congo began to recover around 08:00 local time (07:00 UTC), Congo Telecom’s recovery took longer, with traffic beginning to increase around 17:00 local time (16:00 UTC). Congo Telecom <a href="https://twitter.com/CongoOfficiel/status/1636440652899598368" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on March 16 that the nationwide Internet outage had been resolved.

	<p>In February, the conflict in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ua" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> entered its <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/one-year-of-war-in-ukraine">second year</a>, and over this past year, we have tracked its impact on the Internet, highlighting <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-traffic-patterns-in-ukraine-since-february-21-2022">traffic shifts</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ukraine-update">attacks</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tracking-shifts-in-internet-connectivity-in-kherson-ukraine">routing changes</a>, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q4-2022-internet-disruption-summary">connectivity disruptions</a>. In the fourth quarter of 2022, a number of disruptions were related to attacks on electrical infrastructure, and this pattern continued into the first quarter of 2023.</p>
	<p>One such disruption occurred in Odessa on <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1618602213965692930" target="_blank">January 27</a>, amid <a href="https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/russian-missile-attack-in-ukraine-hits-kyiv-and-energy-plants-near-odessa" target="_blank">news</a> of Russian airstrikes on local energy infrastructure. As seen in the figure below, Internet traffic in Odessa usually begins to climb just before 08:00 local time (06:00 UTC), but failed to do so that morning after several energy infrastructure facilities near Odessa were hit and damaged. Traffic remained lower than levels seen the previous week for <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1618929482366066691" target="_blank">approximately 18 hours</a>.</p>

As seen in the figures below, traffic dropped below normal levels after 02:00 local time (00:00 UTC) on March 9. Traffic in Kharkiv fell over 50% as compared to previous week, while in Odessa, traffic fell as much as 60%. In Odessa, Mykolaiv, and Kirovohrad Oblast, <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1633801985777442823" target="_blank">traffic recovered</a> by around 08:00 local time (06:00 UTC), while in Kharkiv, the disruption lasted nearly two days, <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1635258134758391808" target="_blank">returning to normal levels</a> around 23:45 local time (21:45 UTC) on Friday, March 10.</p>

	<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The first quarter of 2023 seemed to be particularly active from an Internet disruption perspective, but hopefully it is not a harbinger of things to come through the rest of the year. This is especially true of government-directed shutdowns, which occurred fairly regularly through 2022. To that end, civil society organization <a href="https://www.accessnow.org" target="_blank">Access Now</a> recently published their <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdowns-2022" target="_blank"><em>Internet shutdowns in 2022</em></a> report, finding that In 2022, governments and other actors disrupted the internet at least 187 times across 35 countries. Cloudflare Radar is proud to support Access Now’s <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/campaign/keepiton" target="_blank">#KeepItOn</a> initiative, using our data to help illustrate the impact of Internet shutdowns and other disruptions.</p>
