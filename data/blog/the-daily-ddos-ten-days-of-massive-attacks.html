	<p>Back in March my colleague Marek wrote about a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-winter-of-400gbps-weekend-ddos-attacks">Winter of Whopping Weekend DDoS Attacks</a> where we were seeing 400Gbps attacks occurring mostly at the weekends. We speculated that attackers were busy with something else during the week.</p>
	<p>This winter we've seen a new pattern, and attackers aren't taking the week off, but they do seem to be working regular hours.</p>

	<p>On November 23, the day before US Thanksgiving, our systems detected and mitigated an attack that peaked at 172Mpps and 400Gbps. The attack started at 1830 UTC and lasted non-stop for almost exactly 8.5 hours stopping at 0300 UTC. It felt as if an attacker 'worked' a day and then went home.</p>

	<p>The very next day the same thing happened again (although the attack started 30 minutes earlier at 1800 UTC).</p>

	<p>On the third day the attacker started promptly at 1800 UTC but went home a little early at around 0130 UTC. But they managed to peak the attack over 200Mpps and 480Gbps.</p>

	<p>And the attacker just kept this up day after day. Right through <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-truth-about-black-friday-and-cyber-monday">Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday</a> and into this week. Night after night attacks were peaking at 400Gbps and hitting 320Gbps for hours on end.</p>

	<p>This Tuesday things got interesting. The attacker stopped taking the night off and moved onto working 24 hours a day.</p>
	<p>Another curiosity with these attacks is that they are <i>not</i> coming from the much talked about Mirai botnet. They are using different attack software and are sending very large L3/L4 floods aimed at the TCP protocol. The attacks are also highly concentrated in a small number of locations mostly on the US west coast.</p>
	<p>Throughout we've mitigated the attack without impact on customers.</p>
