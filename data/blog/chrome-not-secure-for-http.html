	<p>Less than one month from today, on July 24*, Google will start prominently labeling any site loaded in Chrome without HTTPS as "<b>Not Secure</b>".</p>
	<p>When we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/https-or-bust-chromes-plan-to-label-sites-as-not-secure">wrote about</a> Google’s plans back in February, the percent of sites loaded over HTTPS clocked in at 69.7%. Just one year prior to that only 52.5% of sites were loaded using SSL/TLS—the encryption protocol behind HTTPS—so tremendous progress has been made.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, quite a few popular sites on the web still don’t support HTTPS (or fail to redirect insecure requests) and will soon be flagged by Google. I spent some time scanning the top one million sites, and here’s what I learned about the 946,039 reachable over plaintext (unencrypted) HTTP:</p>

		</a>
	</figure>
	<p>If you were to ask the operators of these sites why they don’t protect themselves and their visitors with HTTPS, the responses you’d get could be bucketed into the following three groups: "I don’t need it", "it’s difficult to do", or "it’s slow".</p>
	<p>None of these are legitimate answers, but they’re common misconceptions so let’s take each in turn.</p>

	<p>This was true.. in the mid 1990s, when I placed my first SSL certificate order. All that has changed.</p>
	<p>Back then, I was a high school student writing software for my friend’s mom’s company. We were getting ready to launch her website and I learned that we needed something called an "SSL certificate" to transact securely online, but I had no idea how to get one.</p>
	<p>After a bit of research conducted over my blazingly fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USRobotics#/media/File:Fax_modem_antigo.jpg">US Robotics Sportster 14.4k</a> modem (we had recently upgraded from the relatively slow MultiTech 9600), I found out that we had to mail the company’s "original" Articles of Incorporation, emblazoned with the State Seal of Massachusetts and signed by company officers, along with a hefty check to some far away office. I asked her what to put for my title, so she shrugged and said "CTO" as that sounded more official and likely to get us approved. A week or so later, the CA <i>finally</i> emailed the certificate.</p>
	<p>Thankfully, we’ve come a long way since then. Today, you can protect your site with HTTPS in a matter of seconds, for free, either by signing up for Cloudflare or using a CA such as Let’s Encrypt. If you use Cloudflare we’ll renew your certificate automatically, and store it within milliseconds of your users for optimal performance, using our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network">150+ data centers</a> around the world. As an added benefit, once we’re handling your SSL/TLS traffic, you can start using technologies like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/workers">Cloudflare Workers</a> to implement any logic you want at the edge.</p>

	<p>While the "it’s difficult" excuse rings hollow for individual site operators, things do get a bit more challenging when you’re dealing with issuing (and regularly renewing) hundreds, thousands, or even millions of certificates. Such is the case for SaaS providers who write and deploy software on another company’s domain, e.g., <a href="https://blog.example.com">https://blog.example.com</a> or <a href="https://mystore.example">https://mystore.example</a>.</p>
	<p>The reason that it can seem difficult to manage SSL certificates on behalf of other companies (putting aside performance and scale for a second), is that Certificate Authorities are only supposed to give out SSL certificates for hostnames where the requestor has "demonstrated control". Fortunately, methods such as HTTP-based validation, i.e., placing a random token on a well-defined path that the CA can access, have reduced the burden on the end-customer to a single step.</p>
	<p>For those that want the benefits of having an edge provider like Cloudflare in front of their servers for acceleration and protection, our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl-for-saas-providers">SSL for SaaS</a> product reduces this process to a single API call. Alternatively, those that wish to handle their own issuance, renewal, certificate hosting, and DDoS protection, the HTTP validation method or <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme">ACME protocol</a> can be used.</p>

	<p>This argument is the most puzzling to me, especially <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp">when spouted</a> by people who should know better. Even if you don’t care about performance—see myth #3 below—surely you care about the safety and privacy of those visiting your site.</p>
	<p>Without HTTPS, anyone in the path between your visitor’s browser and your site or API can snoop on (or modify) your content without your consent. This includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_and_surveillance_by_country">governments</a>, employers, and even especially <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/how-a-banner-ad-for-hs-ok">internet</a> <a href="http://forums.xfinity.com/t5/Customer-Service/Are-you-aware/td-p/3009551">service</a> <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2016/02/china-hacker-malware.html">providers</a>.</p>
	<p>If you care about your users receiving your content unmodified and being safe from maliciously injected advertisements or malware, you care about—and must use—HTTPS.</p>
	<p>Besides safety, there are additional benefits such as <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html">SEO</a> and access to new web features: increasingly, the major browser vendors such as Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft, are <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1072859">restricting functionality</a> to only work over HTTPS. As for mobile apps, Google will soon block <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/previewing-android-p.html">unencrypted connections</a> by default, in their upcoming version of Android. Apple also <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/706">announced</a> (and will soon hopefully follow through on their requirement) that apps must use HTTPS.</p>

	<p>Lastly, the other common myth about HTTPS is that it’s “slow”. This belief is a holdover from an era when SSL/TLS could actually have a negative performance impact on a site, but that's <a href="https://istlsfastyet.com/#cdn-paas">no longer the case</a> today. In fact, HTTPS is required to enable and enjoy the performance benefits of HTTP/2.</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">
		<a href="http://staging.blog.mrk.cfdata.org/content/images/2018/06/is-tls-fast-yet.png">

		</a>
	</figure>
	<p>Detractors typically think HTTPS is slow for two primary reasons: i) it takes marginally more CPU power to encrypt and decrypt data; and ii) establishing a TLS session takes two network round trips between the browser and the server.</p>
	<p>Even with decade old hardware, SSL/TLS adds less than 1% of CPU load, as Adam Langley <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html">explained</a> while debunking the HTTPS performance/cost myth. Today’s processors also come with instruction sets such as AES-NI, that help performance. Further, session resumption technologies reduce the TLS 1.2 overhead and TLS 1.3 aims to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-0-rtt">eliminate these round-trips</a> entirely.</p>
	<p>When HTTPS content is served from the edge, typically 10–20 milliseconds away from your users in the case of Cloudflare, SSL/TLS enabled sites are incredibly fast and performant. And even when they are not served from an edge provider it bears repeating that SSL/TLS is not a performance burden! There’s really no excuse not to use it.</p>
