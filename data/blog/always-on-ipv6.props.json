And to make up for the time lost before the toggle was default on, in August 2016 we went back retroactively and enabled IPv6 for those millions of domains that joined before IPv6 was the default. Over those next few months, we <a href=\"/98-percent-ipv6/\">enabled IPv6 for nearly four million domains</a> –– you can see Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.vyncke.org/ipv6status/plotsite.php?metric=w&global=legacy&pct=y\">dent in the IPv6 universe</a> below –– and by the time we were done, 98.1% of all of our domains had IPv6 connectivity.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1yqnG0ahmUyEnfeUjLrqOi/083db64874e3322e8080e0c44183722e/plotsite.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1024\" height=\"700\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As an interim step, we added an extra feature –– when you turn off IPv6 in our dashboard, we remind you just how archaic we think that is.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3oXyg84nb4l00KrDpmbrez/e7828711f44a4cf0fe78d16277d912be/modal.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"463\" height=\"283\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>With close to 100% IPv6 enablement, it no longer makes sense to offer an IPv6 toggle.

The top operating systems by percent IPv6 traffic are iOS, ChromeOS, and MacOS respectively. These operating systems push significantly more IPv6 traffic than their peers because they use a routing choice algorithm called Happy Eyeballs. Happy Eyeballs opportunistically chooses IPv6 when available by doing two <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/\">DNS</a> lookups –– one for an IPv6 address (this IPv6 address is stored in the DNS AAAA record - pronounced quad-A) and then one for the IPv4 address (stored in the DNS A record). Both DNS queries are flying over the Internet at the same time and the client chooses the address that comes back first. The client even gives IPv6 a few milliseconds head start (iOS and MacOS give IPv6 lookups a 25ms head start for example) so that IPv6 may be chosen more often. This works and has fueled some of IPv6’s growth. But it has fallen short of the goal of a 100% IPv6 world.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/27vp45uqt2lIMVqjzndv86/f6136dbc91d329894a131433df044bfb/A-AAAA.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"637\" height=\"120\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>While there are perfectly good historical reasons why IPv6 and IPv4 addresses are stored in separate DNS types, today clients are IP version agnostic and it no longer makes sense for it to require two separate round trips to learn what addresses are available to fetch a resource from.</p><p>Alongside OpenDNS, we are testing a new idea - what if you could ask for all the addresses in just one DNS query?</p><p>With OpenDNS, we are prototyping and testing just that –– a new DNS metatype that returns all available addresses in one DNS answer –– A records and AAAA records in one response. (A metatype is a query type in DNS that end users can’t add into their DNS zone file, it’s assembled dynamically by the authoritative nameserver.)</p><p>What this means is that in the future if a client like an iPhone wants to access a mobile app that uses Cloudflare DNS or using another DNS provider that supports the spec, the iPhone DNS client would only need to do one DNS lookup to find where the app’s API server is located, cutting the number of necessary round trips in half.</p><p>This reduces the amount of bandwidth on the DNS system, and pre-populates global DNS caches with IPv6 addresses, making IPv6 lookups faster in the future, with the side benefit that Happy Eyeballs clients prefer IPv6 when they can get the address quickly, which increases the amount of IPv6 traffic that flows through the Internet.</p><p>We have the metaquery working in code with the reserved TYPE65535 querytype. You can ask a Cloudflare nameserver for TYPE65535 of any domain on Cloudflare and get back all available addresses for that name.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ dig cloudflare.com @ns1.cloudflare.com -t TYPE65535 +short\n198.41.215.162\n198.41.214.162\n2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d6a2\n2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2\n$</pre></code>\n            <p>Did we mention Taylor Swift earlier?</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ dig taylorswift.com @ns1.cloudflare.com -t TYPE65535 +short\n104.16.193.61\n104.16.194.61\n104.16.191.61\n104.16.192.61\n104.16.195.61\n2400:cb00:2048:1::6810:c33d\n2400:cb00:2048:1::6810:c13d\n2400:cb00:2048:1::6810:bf3d\n2400:cb00:2048:1::6810:c23d\n2400:cb00:2048:1::6810:c03d\n$</pre></code>\n            <p>We believe in proving concepts in code and through the <a href=\"https://ietf.org/\">IETF</a> standards process.
