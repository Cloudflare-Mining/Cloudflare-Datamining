This change came as a result of an outage where an update added a regular expression which backtracked enormously on certain HTTP requests, resulting in exponential execution time.</p><p>After the migration was finished, we saw no measurable difference in CPU consumption at the edge, but noticed execution time outliers in the 95th and 99th percentiles decreased, something we expected given RE2&#39;s guarantees of a linear time execution with the size of the input.</p><p>As the <a href=\"/the-problem-with-event-loops/\">WAF engine uses a thread pool</a>, we also had to implement and tune a regex cache shared between the threads to avoid excessive memory consumption (the first implementation turned out to use a staggering amount of memory).</p><p>These changes, along with others outlined in the <a href=\"/details-of-the-cloudflare-outage-on-july-2-2019/#what-s-happened-since-last-tuesday\">postmortem blog post</a>, helped us improve reliability and safety at the edge and have the confidence to explore further performance improvements.</p><p>But while we’ve highlighted regular expressions, they are only one of the many capabilities of the WAF engine.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"matching-stages\">Matching Stages</h2>\n            <a href=\"#matching-stages\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>When an HTTP request reaches the WAF, it gets organized into several logical sections to be analyzed: method, path, headers, and body. These sections are all stored in <a href=\"/cloudflares-new-waf-compiling-to-lua/\">Lua variables</a>. If you are interested in more detail on the implementation of the WAF itself you can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlt4XKhucS4\">watch this old presentation</a>.</p><p>Before matching these variables against specific malicious request signatures, some transformations are applied. These transformations are functions that range from simple modifications like lowercasing strings to complex tokenizers and parsers looking to fingerprint certain malicious payloads.</p><p>As the WAF currently uses a variant of the <a href=\"https://www.modsecurity.org/\">ModSecurity</a> syntax, this is what a rule might look like:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">SecRule REQUEST_BODY &quot;@rx /\\x00+evil&quot; &quot;drop, t:urlDecode, t:lowercase&quot;</pre></code>\n            <p>It takes the request body stored in the <code>REQUEST_BODY</code> variable, applies the <code>urlDecode()</code> and <code>lowercase()</code> functions to it and then compares the result with the regular expression signature <code>\\x00+evil</code>.</p><p>In pseudo-code, we can represent it as:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">rx( &quot;/\\x00+evil&quot;, lowercase( urlDecode( REQUEST_BODY ) ) )</pre></code>\n            <p>Which in turn would match a request whose body contained <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding\">percent encoded</a> NULL bytes followed by the word &quot;evil&quot;, e.g.:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">POST /cms/admin?action=post HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 16\n\nthiSis%2F%00eVil</pre></code>\n            <p>The WAF contains thousands of these rules and its objective is to execute them as quickly as possible to minimize any added latency to a request. And to make things harder, it needs to run most of the rules on nearly every request. That’s because almost all HTTP requests are non-malicious and no rules are going to match. So we have to optimize for the worst case: execute everything!</p><p>To help mitigate this problem, one of the first matching steps executed for many rules is pre-filtering. By checking if a request contains certain bytes or sets of strings we are able to potentially skip a considerable number of expressions.</p><p>In the previous example, doing a quick check for the NULL byte (represented by <code>\\x00</code> in the regular expression) allows us to completely skip the rule if it isn’t found:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">contains( &quot;\\x00&quot;, REQUEST_BODY )\nand\nrx( &quot;/\\x00+evil&quot;, lowercase( urlDecode( REQUEST_BODY ) ) )</pre></code>\n            <p>Since most requests don’t match any rule and these checks are quick to execute, overall we aren’t doing more operations by adding them.</p><p>Other steps can also be used to scan through and combine several regular expressions and avoid execution of rule expressions. As usual, doing less work is often the simplest way to make a system faster.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"memoization\">Memoization</h2>\n            <a href=\"#memoization\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Which brings us to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization\">memoization</a> - caching the output of a function call to reuse it in future calls.</p><p>Let’s say we have the following expressions:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">1. rx( &quot;\\x00+evil&quot;, lowercase( url_decode( body ) ) )\n2. rx( &quot;\\x00+EVIL&quot;, remove_spaces( url_decode( body ) ) )\n3. rx( &quot;\\x00+evil&quot;, lowercase( url_decode( headers ) ) )\n4. streq( &quot;\\x00evil&quot;, lowercase( url_decode( body ) ) )</pre></code>\n            <p>In this case, we can reuse the result of the nested function calls (1) as they’re the same in (4). By saving intermediate results we are also able to take advantage of the result of <code>url_decode( body )</code> from (1) and use it in (2) and (4). Sometimes it is also possible to swap the order functions are applied to improve caching, though in this case we would get different results.</p><p>A naive implementation of this system can simply be a hash table with each entry having the function(s) name(s) and arguments as the key and its output as the value.</p><p>Some of these functions are expensive and caching the result does lead to significant savings.
