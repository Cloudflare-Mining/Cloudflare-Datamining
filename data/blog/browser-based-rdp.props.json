If you have never heard of that Windows version, it’s because, well, there’s been 16 major Windows releases since then. Regardless, RDP is still used across thousands of organizations to enable remote access to Windows servers. It’s a bit of a strange protocol that relies on a graphical user interface to display screen captures taken in very close succession in order to emulate the interactions on the remote Windows server. (There’s more happening here beyond the screen captures, including drawing commands, bitmap updates, and even video streams. Like we said — it’s a bit strange.) Because of this complexity, RDP can be computationally demanding and poses a challenge for running at high performance over traditional <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-vpn/\">VPNs</a>.</p><p>Beyond its quirks, RDP has also had a rather <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/rdp-security-risks/\"><u>unsavory reputation</u></a> in the security industry due to early vulnerabilities with the protocol. The two main offenders are weak user sign-in credentials and unrestricted port access. Windows servers are commonly protected by passwords, which often have inadequate security to start, and worse still, may be shared across multiple accounts. This leaves these RDP servers open to brute force or credential stuffing attacks. </p><p>Bad actors have abused RDP’s default port, 3389, to carry out on-path attacks. One of the most severe RDP vulnerabilities discovered is called BlueKeep. Officially known as <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0708\"><i>CVE-2019-0708</i></a>, BlueKeep is a vulnerability that allows <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-remote-code-execution/\">remote code execution (RCE) </a>without authentication, as long as the request adheres to a specific format and is sent to a port running RDP. Worse still, it is wormable, meaning that BlueKeep can spread to other machines within the network with no user action. Because bad actors can compromise RDP to gain unauthorized access, attackers can then <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-lateral-movement/\">move laterally</a> within the network, escalating privileges, and installing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/malware/\">malware</a>. RDP has also been used to deploy <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/ransomware/what-is-ransomware/\">ransomware</a> such as Ryuk, Conti, and DoppelPaymer, earning it the nickname “Ransomware Delivery Protocol.” </p><p>This is a subset of vulnerabilities in RDP’s history, but we don’t mean to be discouraging. Thankfully, due to newer versions of Windows, CVE patches, improved password hygiene, and better awareness of privileged access, many organizations have reduced their <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-an-attack-surface/\">attack surface</a>. However, for as many secured Windows servers that exist, there are still countless unpatched or poorly configured systems online, making them easy targets for ransomware and botnets. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-need-for-a-browser-based-rdp-solution\">The need for a browser-based RDP solution</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-need-for-a-browser-based-rdp-solution\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Despite its <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/rdp-security-risks/\">security risks</a>, RDP remains essential for many organizations, particularly those with distributed workforces and third-party contractors. It provides value for compute-intensive tasks that require high-powered Windows servers with CPU/GPU resources greater than users’ machines can offer. For security-focused organizations, RDP grants better visibility into who is accessing Windows servers and what actions are taken during those sessions. </p><p>Because issuing corporate devices to contractors is costly and cumbersome, many organizations adopt a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy. This decision instead requires organizations to provide contractors with a means to RDP to a Windows server with the necessary corporate resources to fulfill their role.</p><p>Traditional RDP requires client software on user devices, so this is not an appropriate solution for contractors (or any employees) using personal machines or unmanaged devices. Previously, Cloudflare customers had to rely on self-hosted third-party tools like <a href=\"https://guacamole.apache.org/\"><u>Apache Guacamole</u></a> or <a href=\"https://devolutions.net/gateway/\"><u>Devolutions Gateway</u></a> to enable browser-based RDP access. This created several operational pain points:</p><ul><li><p><b>Infrastructure complexity:</b> Deploying and maintaining RDP gateways increases operational overhead.</p></li><li><p><b>Maintenance burden:</b> Commercial and open-source tools may require frequent updates and patches, sometimes even necessitating custom forks.</p></li><li><p><b>Compliance challenges:</b> Third-party software requires additional security audits and risk management assessments, particularly for regulated industries.</p></li><li><p><b>Redundancy, but not the good kind</b> - Customers come to Cloudflare to reduce the complexity of maintaining their infrastructure, <i>not add to it</i>.</p></li></ul><p>We’ve been listening. Cloudflare has architectured a high-performance RDP proxy that leverages the modern security controls already part of our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/\"><u>Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)</u></a> service. We feel that the “security/performance tradeoff” the industry commonly touts is a dated mindset.

It was selected because it is a modern, well-maintained, RDP client implementation that offers an efficient and responsive experience. Unlike Java-based Apache Guacamole, another popular RDP client implementation, IronRDP is built with Rust and integrates very well with Cloudflare’s development ecosystem.</p><p>While selecting the right tools can make all the difference, using a browser to facilitate an RDP session faces some challenges. From a practical perspective, browsers just can&#39;t send RDP messages. RDP relies directly on the Layer 4 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for communication, and while browsers can use TCP as the underlying protocol, they do not expose APIs that would let apps build protocol support directly on raw TCP sockets.</p><p>Another challenge is rooted in a security consideration: the username and password authentication mechanism that is native to RDP leaves a lot to be desired in the modern world of Zero Trust.</p><p>In order to tackle both of these challenges, the IronRDP client encapsulates the RDP session in a WebSocket connection. Wrapping the Layer 4 TCP traffic in HTTPS enables the client to use native browser APIs to communicate with Cloudflare’s RDP proxy. Additionally, it enables Cloudflare Access to secure the entire session using identity-aware policies. By attaching a Cloudflare Access authorization JSON Web Token (JWT) via cookie to the WebSocket connection, every inter-service hop of the RDP session is verified to be coming from the authenticated user.  </p><p>A brief aside into how security and performance is optimized: in conventional client-based RDP traffic, the client and server negotiate a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/\">TLS</a> connection to secure and verify the session. However, because the browser WebSocket connection is already secured with TLS to Cloudflare, we employ IronRDP’s RDCleanPath protocol extension to eliminate this second encapsulation of traffic. Removing this redundancy avoids unnecessary performance degradation and increased complexity during session handshakes.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h5 id=\"the-server\">The server</h5>\n      <a href=\"#the-server\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The IronRDP client initiates a WebSocket connection to a dedicated WebSocket proxy, which is responsible for authenticating the client, terminating the WebSocket connection, and proxying tunneled RDP traffic deeper into Cloudflare’s infrastructure to facilitate connectivity. The seemingly simple task of determining how this WebSocket proxy should be built turned out to be the most challenging<b> </b>decision in the development process. </p><p>Our initial proposal was to develop a new service that would run on every server within our network. While this was feasible, operating a new service would introduce a non-trivial maintenance burden, which ultimately turned out to be more overhead than value-add in this case. The next proposal was to build it into <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/upgrading-one-of-the-oldest-components-in-cloudflare-software-stack/\"><u>Front Line</u></a> (FL), one of Cloudflare’s oldest services that is responsible for handling tens of millions of HTTP requests per second. This approach would have sidestepped the need to expose new IP addresses and benefitted from the existing scaffolding to let the team move quickly. Despite being promising at first, this approach was decided against because FL is undergoing significant investment, and the team didn&#39;t want to build on shifting sands.</p><p>Finally, we identified a solution that implements the proxy service using <a href=\"https://workers.cloudflare.com/\"><u>Cloudflare Workers</u></a>! Fortunately, Workers automatically scales to massive request rates, which eliminates some of the groundwork we’d lay if we had chosen to build a new service. Candidly, this approach was not initially preferred due to some ambiguities around how Workers communicates with internal Cloudflare services, but with support from the Workers team, we found a path forward. </p><p>From the WebSocket proxy Worker, the tunneled RDP connection is sent to the Apollo service, which is responsible for routing traffic between on-ramps and off-ramps for <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/\">Cloudflare Zero Trust</a>. Apollo centralizes and abstracts these complexities to let other services focus on application-specific functionality. Apollo determines which Cloudflare colo is closest to the target Cloudflare Tunnel and establishes a connection to an identical Apollo instance running in that colo. The egressing Apollo instance can then facilitate the final connection to the Cloudflare Tunnel. By using Cloudflare&#39;s global network to traverse the distance between the ingress colo and the target Cloudflare Tunnel, network disruptions and congestion is managed.</p><p>Apollo connects to the RDP server and passes the ingress and egress connections to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/from-ip-packets-to-http-the-many-faces-of-our-oxy-framework/\"><u>Oxy</u></a>-teams, the service responsible for inspecting and proxying the RDP traffic. It functions as a pass-through (strictly enabling traffic connectivity) as the web client authenticates to the RDP server. Our initial release makes use of <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/ntlm-overview\"><u>NT Lan Manager (NTLM)</u></a> authentication, a challenge-response authentication protocol requiring username and password entry. Once the client has authenticated with the server, Oxy-teams is able to proxy all subsequent RDP traffic!</p><p>This may sound like a lot of hops, but every server in our network runs every service. So believe it or not, this complex dance takes place on a single server and by using UNIX domain sockets for communication, we also minimize any performance impact. If any of these servers become overloaded, experience a network fault, or have a hardware problem, the load is automatically shifted to a neighboring server with the help of <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/\"><u>Unimog</u></a>, Cloudflare’s L4 load balancer.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"putting-it-all-together\">Putting it all together</h4>\n      <a href=\"#putting-it-all-together\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <ol><li><p><b>User initiation:</b> The user selects an RDP server from Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/app-launcher/\"><u>App Launcher</u></a> (or accesses it via a direct URL).
