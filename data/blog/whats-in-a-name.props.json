We needed a placeholder so we initially chose &quot;Project\nWebWall.&quot; That wasn&apos;t very sexy, but it essentially described what we\nwere initially trying to do: build a &quot;firewall in the cloud.&quot;</p>\n<p>We tried a bunch of names along those lines: FireCloud, CloudWall,\nFireCloudWallandOtherCoolStuff... either things didn&apos;t sound right, they\nwere being used by someone else, or their domains were already taken. At\nsome point my friend Emily suggested Cloudflare. It was perfect, the\ndomain unregistered, and so we snapped it up.</p>\n<p>After we had a name the next step was to create a logo. Years ago I&apos;d\nmet Lindon Leader at a Chamber of Commerce event in my home town of Park\nCity, Utah. He&apos;d recently retired there with his wife who was originally\nfrom the area. Lindon is amazing. He designed the branding for companies\nlike Double Tree Hotels, Ryder Trucks, Hawaiian Airlines, the NCAA, and\nmany more you&apos;d immediately recognize. The one he may be most famous for\nis FedEx, which is definitely one of the coolest logos ever. If you\ndon&apos;t know the story of its design, you can read an <a href=\"http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/000273.php\">interview with\nLindon</a> about it.</p>\n<p>I&apos;d saved Lindon&apos;s card over the years and gave him a call to see if\nhe&apos;d be willing to work on our logo. It was a long shot given his\nreputation and our limited budget. He thought the project sounded cool\nand put together the design you see today. He was amazing to work with\nand we remain flattered he&apos;d take the time to help us start to build our\nbrand.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare has turned out to be a terrific name and we love our logo. As\nwe&apos;ve added more performance-related features to complement our original\nideas around security the brand has continued to hold up and feel right.\nGoing forward we think Cloudflare is a brand that can support our lofty\nmission: to secure and better power the entire Internet.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
