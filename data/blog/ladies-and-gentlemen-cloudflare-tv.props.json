In the background, throughout much of it, was linear television we watched together. Over the last few months I&#39;ve learned that Michelle Zatlyn, my co-founder and Cloudflare&#39;s COO, and I shared a love of Children&#39;s Television Network&#39;s education program &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2-LEBc2sO8\">3-2-1 Contact</a>.&quot; John Graham-Cumming, Cloudflare&#39;s CTO, and I spent much of the late-90&#39;s and early-00’s watching programs like &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rp6BcRK9Z4\">Call for Help</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbTFF3NNCdM\">The Screensavers</a>&quot; on TechTV. Talking to many people across the Cloudflare team, we all shared common touchstones in our lives geeking out on nerdy programming about technical topics.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3G7uKNeGt9Usd6wrY0LLkc/953b5e17cc32f8fe6280b3cd3de3027d/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"650\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In some ways, a bit of that shared experience has been replaced by the modern tech conference. Tech conferences have four key features that keep people coming back in, I think, the following order of importance (from least to most): 1. Keynotes from interesting people; 2. Product and new feature demos; 3. Conversations with technical experts; and 4. Social interactions with peers.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"rsa-and-ces-aint-workin-but-thats-the-way-you-do-it\">RSA and CES Ain’t Workin… But That’s the Way You Do It?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#rsa-and-ces-aint-workin-but-thats-the-way-you-do-it\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Tech conferences have a lot of downsides too. Everyone complains about going to the Consumer Electronic Show or RSA because, in a lot of ways, spending a lot of money to be away from families, stay in difficult to book hotels, eat unhealthy food, and get herded around like cattle is awful. And yet, the value of the four things above is enough that we all continue to attend.</p><p>Or… we did. But, given the current pandemic, it feels like a long time before we&#39;re going to be attending tech conferences again. So, at Cloudflare, we started to wonder, is there a way to replicate their best features (and not suffer their worst) in a COVID-19 world?</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"covid-changes-everything\">COVID Changes Everything</h3>\n      <a href=\"#covid-changes-everything\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare has offices in Asia, and we source the hardware for our equipment from the region, and so, since the virus hit those parts of the world first, we were aware of its impacts early. We adjusted our work and travel policies in our Asian offices early. Then we did something else: call around to companies in the impacted regions to ask them what they were doing that was still working even when everyone was working from home.</p><p>The answer that stood out from multiple companies was empowering more of their team to experiment with new ideas to reach customers. I remember a conversation with a cosmetics company that, prior to the conference, had used in-person events to sell most of their products. They were forced to invent new strategies as soon as the pandemic hit. They didn&#39;t know what would work — no one did. So they empowered everyone on their sales team to run experiments. &quot;Some of them proved so successful,&quot; the head of marketing for this firm told me, &quot;that I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever go back to in-person events even after this time of the virus has passed.&quot;</p><p>So, as we shut down conferences and travel, and transitioned to remote work globally, I went to Jake Anderson, who runs Cloudflare&#39;s marketing team, and asked him to pivot to empower everyone on our sales and marketing team to be able to run experiments. That&#39;s the sort of thing that makes a ton of sense to a founder-CEO like me. It&#39;s the sort of thing that strikes abject terror in the mind of any experienced marketing professional like Jake.</p><p>Jake took a deep breath and explained the danger of that strategy. Hundreds of different people on our team each running their own experiments may result in some good things, but also potentially a lot of chaos along the way. &quot;Your last company was an anti-spam company, right?&quot; he asked, rhetorically. &quot;Do you really want the risk of everyone on the team thinking sending out mass emails is a good idea?&quot; And now you understand why Jake runs our marketing team.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"tv-as-the-new-tech-conference\">TV as the New Tech Conference</h3>\n      <a href=\"#tv-as-the-new-tech-conference\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>But he was a good sport and didn&#39;t fully nix the idea. Instead we started brainstorming whether there could be a way to let our team run experiments — let them even be zany, crazy ideas — but do it in a way that had some structure and a framework and where any missteps could be contained. And that’s how the idea for Cloudflare TV was born.</p><p>If you read the history, it&#39;s actually not that different from how MTV was born. It was an experiment. No one knew if the format would work. Early hosts were given a lot of leeway to try new things. And, out of it, many incredible things emerged. In the process, it brought a community and a generation together.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"introducing-cloudflare-tv-a-platform-to-experiment\">Introducing Cloudflare TV: A Platform to Experiment</h3>\n      <a href=\"#introducing-cloudflare-tv-a-platform-to-experiment\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare is unlikely to morph into a television network.

I&#39;m looking forward to kicking off that conversation with Chris Young on Monday (<a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/schedule/7ADOoIIKxFMhvG89to4VQn\">add to calendar</a>).</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"tune-in-geek-out\">Tune In, Geek Out</h3>\n      <a href=\"#tune-in-geek-out\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We&#39;re aiming to make as much of the content interactive as possible. We&#39;ll be interviewing existing customers and partners. We’re hosting as much of the content live so that the hosts of many programs will respond to questions from the audience. If you tune in, you&#39;ll get to hear from the product managers and engineers that are building Cloudflare, ask them questions, and get responses live.</p><p>There will be lots of snafus. None of us have ever been television producers before. In MTV&#39;s early days, they regularly failed to a blank screen. The production quality was low. And some experiments didn&#39;t work. If we&#39;re lucky, this won&#39;t be any different. But, if we&#39;re really lucky, hopefully some great things will also come out of it. I keep reminding our team that if we&#39;re trying to follow in the footsteps of MTV — and its greatest success was &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; — then the bar is pretty low.</p><p>So hope you&#39;ll tune in, geek out, feel part of our community, and learn more about Cloudflare and the people who are building it. And, if it works, maybe none of us will ever need to go to RSA again.</p><p>Check out the Cloudflare TV Guide: <a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/schedule\">cloudflare.tv/schedule</a></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2YSSNKRZmLOhHtcM3HDAKV/89054c000cde9c002040382d600a91fa/twitter-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>",
