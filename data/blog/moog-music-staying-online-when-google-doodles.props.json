The site celebrates Bob Moog&#39;s legacy and sells versions of his keyboards and other devices (including a <a href=\"http://www.moogmusic.com/products/apps/animoog-iphone-99-until-5292012\">pretty sweet iPhoneapp</a>). Google contacted the site owners to give them notice that there was going to be a doodle four days ago. The only catch, they had to keep the information strictly confidential until the doodle went live in Australia (the first region to see new doodles every day). Oh, and, by the way, Google noted, they should prepare for a crushing load of traffic to their website.</p><p>That presented a bit of a conundrum. Moog Music turned to their web developers, a technically savvy shop called <a href=\"http://purplecat.net/\">PurpleCat.net</a>. The site was designed to handle half a million hits a day, so the team at PurpleCat spent the next threedays making several improvements to the site to increase its capacity. They migrated the site to new hardware, secured a dedicated gigabit port, migrated the mysql database to its own server, upgraded the backend of the site replacing Apache with NGINX and added layers of caching and optimizations. Needless to say, it was a busy three days for the PurpleCat team while they did all the upgrades to prepare for the traffic surge. The site, however, was on a single virtual private server (VPS) with limited resources and it didn&#39;t make sense to upgrade the whole infrastructure for a one-day spike in traffic.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"turning-to-cloudflare-to-help\">Turning to CloudFlare to Help</h3>\n            <a href=\"#turning-to-cloudflare-to-help\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As soon as the doodle went live in Australia and the embargo was lifted, PurpleCat called us at CloudFlare and explained what was about to happen.

While some of the site is dynamic, large portions are relatively static. That meant a Page Rule could define the static portions -- like the front page and a history of Moog&#39;s legacy -- and instruct CloudFlare to Cache Everything, even the HTML. That means we will serve all requests to the pages that match the rule from our infrastructure without <i>any</i> requests getting sent to the VPS.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6FUYxDYabfTCo7UHijaJEU/dc99ee5de3ca9b7703e09389a4f3f008/moogmusic_page_rules_cache_everything.png.scaled500.png\" alt=\"Moog Music: Staying online when Google doodles you\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"133\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The results were dramatic. Approximately 92% of requests that would have previously hit the VPS were instead fielded directly by CloudFlare. We also reduced bandwidth needed to serve the requests to MoogMusic.com by more than 90%.

And so does everyone else at CloudFlare.
