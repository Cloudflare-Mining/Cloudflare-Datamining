A reasonable person’s expectations of what the Internet should be able to deliver in 2022 are simply unmet by the dominant set of protocols carried over from past eras.</p><p><b>Viewers</b> increasingly expect “live” to mean “real-time”. People want to place bets on sports broadcasts in real-time, interact and ask questions to presenters in real-time, and never feel behind their friends at a live event.</p><p>In practice, the HLS and DASH standards used to deliver video have 10+ seconds of latency. LL-HLS and LL-DASH bring this down to closer to 5 seconds, but only as a hack on top of the existing protocol that delivers segments of video in individual HTTP requests. Sending mini video clips over TCP simply cannot deliver video in real-time. HLS and DASH are here to stay, but aren’t the future of real-time live video.</p><p><b>Creators and broadcasters</b> expect to be able to go live from anywhere, on any device.</p><p>In practice, people creating live content are stuck with a limited set of native apps, and can’t go live using RTMP from a web browser. Because it’s built on top of TCP, the RTMP broadcasting protocol struggles under even the slightest network disruption, making it a poor or often unworkable option when broadcasting from mobile networks. RTMP, originally built for use with Adobe Flash Player, was <a href=\"https://rtmp.veriskope.com/pdf/rtmp_specification_1.0.pdf\">last updated in 2012</a>, and while Stream supports the <a href=\"/magic-hdmi-cable/\">newer SRT protocol</a>, creators need an option that works natively on the web and can more easily be integrated in native apps.</p><p><b>Developers</b> expect to be able to build using standard APIs that are built into web browsers and native apps.</p><p>In practice, RTMP can’t be used from a web browser, and creating a native app that supports RTMP broadcasting typically requires diving into lower-level programming languages like C and Rust. Only those with expertise in both live video protocols and these languages have full access to the tools needed to create novel live streaming client applications.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"were-solving-this-by-using-new-open-webrtc-standards-whip-and-whep\">We’re solving this by using new open WebRTC standards: WHIP and WHEP</h3>\n            <a href=\"#were-solving-this-by-using-new-open-webrtc-standards-whip-and-whep\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>WebRTC is the real-time communications protocol, supported across all web browsers, that powers video calling services like Zoom and Google Meet. Since inception it’s been designed for real-time, ultra low-latency communications.</p><p>While WebRTC is well established, for most of its history it’s lacked standards for:</p><ul><li><p><b>Ingestion</b> — how broadcasters should <b><i>send</i></b> media content (akin to RTMP today)</p></li><li><p><b>Egress</b> — how viewers request and <b><i>receive</i></b> media content (akin to DASH or HLS today)</p></li></ul><p>As a result, developers have had to implement this on their own, and client applications on both sides are often tightly coupled to provider-specific implementations. Developers we talk to often express frustration, having sunk months of engineering work into building around a specific vendor’s SDK, unable to switch without a significant rewrite of their client apps.</p><p>At Cloudflare, our mission is broader — we’re helping to build a better Internet. Today we’re launching not just a new feature of Cloudflare Stream, but a vote of confidence in new WebRTC standards for both ingestion and egress. We think you should be able to start using Stream without feeling locked into an SDK or implementation specific to Cloudflare, and we’re committed to using open standards whenever possible.</p><p>For ingestion, <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-wish-whip-03.html\">WHIP</a> is an IETF draft on the Standards Track, with many applications already successfully using it in production. For delivery (egress), <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-murillo-whep-00.html\">WHEP</a> is an IETF draft with broad agreement. Combined, they provide a standardized end-to-end way to broadcast one-to-many over WebRTC at scale.</p><p><b>Cloudflare Stream is the first cloud service to let you both broadcast using WHIP and playback using WHEP — no vendor-specific SDK needed.</b> Here’s how it works:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/19Hq5GYMLCWmxGoKQBiifO/2d27697b3337afa9eb5117a31a1dbe9e/image2-44.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"834\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Cloudflare Stream is already built on top of the Cloudflare developer platform, using Workers and Durable Objects running on Cloudflare’s global network, within 50ms of 95% of the world’s Internet-connected population.</p><p>Our WebRTC implementation extends this to relay WebRTC video through our network. Broadcasters stream video using WHIP to the point of presence closest to their location, which tells the Durable Object where the live stream can be found. Viewers request streaming video from the point of presence closest to them, which asks the Durable Object where to find the stream, and video is routed through Cloudflare’s network, all with sub-second latency.</p><p>Using Durable Objects, we achieve this with zero centralized state. And just like the rest of Cloudflare Stream, you never have to think about regions, both in terms of pricing and product development.</p><p>While existing ultra low-latency streaming providers charge significantly more to stream over WebRTC, because Stream runs on Cloudflare’s global network, we’re able to offer WebRTC streaming at the same price as delivering video over HLS or DASH. We don’t think you should be penalized with higher pricing when choosing which technology to rely on to stream live video. Once generally available, WebRTC streaming will cost $1 per 1000 minutes of video delivered, just like the rest of Stream.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"what-does-sub-second-latency-let-you-build\">What does sub-second latency let you build?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#what-does-sub-second-latency-let-you-build\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Ultra low latency unlocks interactivity within your website or app, removing the time delay between creators, in-person attendees, and those watching remotely.</p><p>Developers we talk to are building everything from live sports betting, to live auctions, to live viewer Q&amp;A and even real-time collaboration in video post-production.

We intend to support the full <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-wish-whip-03.html\">WHIP specification</a>, including supporting <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8838\">Trickle ICE</a> for fast NAT traversal.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"play-a-live-stream-in-a-browser-with-sub-second-latency-no-sdk-required\">Play a live stream in a browser, with sub-second latency, no SDK required</h3>\n            <a href=\"#play-a-live-stream-in-a-browser-with-sub-second-latency-no-sdk-required\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Once you’ve started streaming, copy the playback URL from the live input you just created, and paste it into the example linked below.</p><p>Read the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/webrtc-beta/\">docs</a> or <a href=\"https://workers.new/stream/webrtc\">run the example code below in your browser using Stackbltiz</a>.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;video id=&quot;playback&quot; controls autoplay muted&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</pre></code>\n            \n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">import WHEPClient from &#039;./WHEPClient.js&#039;;\nconst url = &quot;&lt;WEBRTC_PLAYBACK_URL_FROM_YOUR_LIVE_INPUT&gt;&quot;;\nconst videoElement = document.getElementById(&quot;playback&quot;);\nconst client = new WHEPClient(url, videoElement);</pre></code>\n            <p>Just like the WHIP example before, this one uses an example WHEP client we’ve written that has zero dependencies.
