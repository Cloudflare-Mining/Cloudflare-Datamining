Photo by Sam Barnes/Web Summit</p><p>Global in-person events were back in a big way at the start of November (1-4) in Lisbon, Portugal, with Web Summit 2021 gathering more than 42,000 attendees from 128 countries. I was there to discover Internet trends and meet interesting people. What I saw was the contagious excitement of people from all corners of the world coming together for what seemed like a type of normality in a time when the Internet “is almost as important as having water”, according to Sonia Jorge from the World Wide Web Foundation.</p><p>Here’s some of what I heard in the halls.</p><p>With a lot happening on a screen, the lockdowns throughout the pandemic showed us a glimpse of what the metaverse could be, just without VR or AR headsets. Think about the way many were able to use virtual tools to work all day, learn, collaborate, order food, supplies, and communicate with friends and family — all from their homes.</p><p>While many had this experience, many others were unable to, with some talks at the event focusing on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide\">digital divide</a> and how “Internet access is a basic human right”, according to the grandson of Nelson Mandela — we interviewed him, and you can watch the conversation below.</p><p>The future already has some paths laid out, and many were discussed at the event.</p><p>The pandemic helped to accelerate most of them, especially by bringing more people (in some countries) to the digital world.</p><p>The CPO of Meta, Chris Cox, shared how the company previously known as Facebook has some ideas about the future of augmented reality, and how they want to see those ideas play out in the next five to 10 years. “We want to get the conversation going,” he said.</p><p>Also present at the event was Jon Vlassopulos, Global Head of Music, Roblox. He explained how virtual concerts on the video game platform could be the future of music performances, and even bring free tickets to fans of famous music stars like Adele. Stars like Zara Larsson, KSI and Ava Max have already performed on Roblox and “they’re making big money from selling digital merchandise”.</p><p>On the other hand, Paddy Cosgrave, CEO of Web Summit, says that there’s something magical about in-person big events that can’t be replicated in full online events. However, the real and virtual world can complement each other — it was announced that CES 2022 will use a combination of Web Summit online and offline software.</p><p>Web3 was another big part of the discussion, sometimes in clear sight, other times embedded in the many conversations about blockchain, NFTs and cryptocurrencies, and as <a href=\"/what-is-web3/\">a vision for a decentralized web</a> (we’re actually <a href=\"/announcing-web3-gateways/\">working on that</a>).</p><p>Speakers also focused on data privacy and security, ethics in AI and data protection. Ownership to the user and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-data-sovereignty/\">sovereignty</a> were topics discussed and emphasized by Sir Tim Berners-Lee on the last day of the event.</p><p>The workplace was also a popular topic, as well as the changes it underwent in the past couple of years. We heard about the importance of diversity in the workplace, as well as the future of work — is it going to be flexible, hybrid, full remote or something in between? Speakers also mentioned <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation\">The Great Resignation</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/focus/the-great-reset\">reset</a> of people’s and organizations’ mindsets.</p><p>Using AI to hire and motivate people was also in the air, as well as big topics like the digitalization of healthcare, mental health, behaviour changes in humans (young and adult) who are more and more on the Internet and even the decentralization of financial services.</p><p>And here are some examples of the different speakers at the event we talked to:</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"vice-admiral-gouveia-e-melo-vaccination-misinformation-and-leadership\">Vice-Admiral Gouveia e Melo: Vaccination, misinformation and leadership</h3>\n      <a href=\"#vice-admiral-gouveia-e-melo-vaccination-misinformation-and-leadership\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><b>Portuguese Navy officer and coordinator of the Task Force for the Portugal COVID-19 vaccination plan</b></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframe.videodelivery.net/d7ce362ea7d517808ec88d7b8809230f?preload=true&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fvideodelivery.net%2Fd7ce362ea7d517808ec88d7b8809230f%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D14s%26height%3D600&primaryColor=%23f6821f\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\" allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Portugal has achieved an 86% vaccination rate on the vice-admiral’s watch.

In some places people have to go to a particular plaza to have access to the Internet <b>—</b> five years ago John Graham-Cumming saw <a href=\"/the-cuban-cdn/\">something similar in Cuba</a>. Sonia Jorge knows that very well. She is trying to bring affordable Internet to everyone and that challenge is more difficult than it appears.</p><p>She explains that the world is far behind in the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/sdi20-united-nations-sdg-digital-cooperation/\">UN’s goals for Internet access</a> — today only about half of the earth’s population has any Internet access at all. But many of those who have access to the World Wide Web have limited possibilities to be online: “some have access once a month, for example.” So the digital divide is real, and it “should worry everyone”.</p><p>The pandemic caused health and economic difficulties that didn’t help the mission of bringing good, fast and reliable Internet to everyone. Nevertheless, Sonia — who is Portuguese and moved to the US to study when she was 17 — saw that many African countries like Nigeria began to realize that the Internet is really important for knowledge and also for the possibilities it opens in terms of cultural, financial and societal growth.</p><p>Sonia also highlights that there is a big disparity in the world between men and women in terms of Internet access.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"david-kiron-the-future-of-work-and-how-ai-and-philosophy-can-help\">David Kiron: The future of work and how AI (and philosophy) can help</h3>\n      <a href=\"#david-kiron-the-future-of-work-and-how-ai-and-philosophy-can-help\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><b>Editorial director of MIT Sloan Management Review</b></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframe.videodelivery.net/ecdf4803e83866182ef1f9b9d6509106?preload=true&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fvideodelivery.net%2Fecdf4803e83866182ef1f9b9d6509106%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D13s%26height%3D600&primaryColor=%23f6821f\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\" allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Technology will play a significant role in the future of work. In a way, that “future” is already here, but isn’t evenly distributed — and researchers are just beginning to study it. David Kiron goes on to explain the challenge for some people to be “really seen by their leadership when you’re not in the office.”</p><p>The former senior researcher at Harvard Business School tells us how companies started valuing employees even more through the pandemic. There’s also an opportunity for different ways of work interaction through digital tools — “Zoom calls aren’t it.” He’s also worried that the pandemic caused a great reset that is driving many out of the workforce entirely: “There’s a trend of working moms opting out,” for example.</p><p>About the metaverse and a universe of universes: “If tech leaders spent more time reading philosophy they might have a better sense of where the world is going (...) more and more leaders of companies are taking on the philosopher&#39;s role.”</p><p>And how can <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/\">AI</a> help? “Once you get AI going in a company we saw in our new study that there’s a big bump in morale, collaboration, learning and people’s sense on what they should be doing”. AI can also help better identify talent and match candidates to skills that are already represented in a company, but he also highlights that “humans play a role in all the stages of the hiring and working process.”</p><p>David Kiron explains that “if you’re not asking the right questions to your AI teams you’re going to be behind other companies that are doing better questions”. He adds that AI can help with performance, but it also helps “redefine what performance means in your organization by finding other metrics to look at.”</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"ana-maiques-neuroscience-women-in-tech\">Ana Maiques: neuroscience &amp; women in tech</h3>\n      <a href=\"#ana-maiques-neuroscience-women-in-tech\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><b>Co-founder and CEO of neuroscience-based medical device company Neuroelectrics</b></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframe.videodelivery.net/19c3bff3373c68eebd170e1ef13a4b97?preload=true&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fvideodelivery.net%2F19c3bff3373c68eebd170e1ef13a4b97%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D11s%26height%3D600&primaryColor=%23f6821f\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\" allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We talked to Ana about the future of the Internet.
