	<p>Caching is great. <a href="https://cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> makes sites faster
		in part by taking the static portions of your site and moving them
		closer to the visitors to your site. Cloudflare is smart about only
		caching static objects so you can run a dynamic, database-driven site
		and it will behave as you expect. However, sometimes you want to edit
		static files like CSS, Javascript, or existing images and it can be
		frustrating to wait a few hours for the Cloudflare cache to expire.
		There are two ways to deal with this problem:</p>
	<p><strong>Go to Development Mode</strong><br>
		<a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22280726-What-does-CloudFlare-Development-mode-mean-" target="_blank">Development Mode</a>
		bypasses Cloudflare's accelerated cache and slows down your site, but is
		useful if you are making changes to cacheable content (like images, css,
		or JavaScript) and would like to see those changes right away. You can
		get to Development Mode by going to:<br>
		Settings-&gt;Cloudflare Settings-&gt;Development Mode-&gt;Toggle On.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Purge Cache</strong><br>
		We read every email and tweet that we get. Often users write in with
		feature requests and we aim to build the most common ones quickly. This
		week, we released a new Cloudflare feature based on user feedback called
		the "Cache Purge". Some frequently asked questions about the "Cache
		Purge" can be found below:</p>
	<p><strong>Where can I find the purge cache option?</strong><br>
		The cache purge option is found by going to Settings-&gt;Cloudflare
		settings.</p>
	<p><strong>What does the cache purge option do?</strong><br>
		Cache purge will Immediately purge all cached resources for your
		website. This will force Cloudflare to expire all static resources
		cached prior to the button click and fetch a new version.<br>
	</p>
	<p><strong>I have more than one domain. Do I have to purge the cache for each<br>
			site?</strong><br>
		The cache purge is done at the domain level (purging will refresh the<br>
		cache for all your websites that share a domain).</p>
	<p></p>
	<p><strong>Can I only purge certain file extensions?</strong><br>
		No, not at this time. Please <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/contact.html" target="_blank">contact
			us</a> if you would like to see us
		develop additional caching features.</p>
	<p><strong>How often should I purge my cache?</strong><br>
		You should purge your cache if there is a cached resource that you want
		to immediately stop serving. If you are doing development and making
		constant changes, use Development Mode instead.</p>
	<p><strong>Keep in mind...</strong><br>
		You will end up slowing down your site if you're constantly purging
		resources from your site. When you purge the cache, that means we have
		to fetch all requested resources from your server. It will take up to 3
		days to rebuild the cache to an optimal level depending on the traffic
		to your site. What this really means is that your site will not be at
		optimal performance until the cache rebuilds.</p>
