Unlike a traditional private network, Access follows a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust model</a>. Cloudflare’s edge checks every request to protected resources for identity and other signals like device posture (i.e., information about a user’s machine, like Operating system version, if antivirus is running, etc.).</p><p>By deploying Cloudflare Access, our security and IT teams could build granular rules for each application and log every request and event. Cloudflare’s network accelerated how users connected. We <a href=\"/cloudflare-access-now-teams-of-any-size-can-turn-off-their-vpn/\">launched</a> Access as a product for our customers in 2018 to share those improvements with <a href=\"/teams-plans/\">teams of any size</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/63ItdeWGnwFjJ2RbGoI2vf/b2a30a4057d4db283b461b531fdc35fb/image3-46.png\" alt=\"Integrating Cloudflare Gateway and Access\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1382\" height=\"663\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Over the last two years, we added new types of rules that check for <a href=\"/require-hard-key-auth-with-cloudflare-access/\">hardware security keys</a>, <a href=\"/two-clicks-to-enable-regional-zero-trust-compliance/\">location</a>, and other signals. However, we were still left with some challenges:</p><ul><li><p>What happened to devices before they connected to applications behind Access?

Gateway can then take actions like prevent users from connecting to destinations that contain malware or block the upload of files to unapproved locations.</p><p>With today’s launch, you can now build Access rules that restrict connections to devices that are running Cloudflare Gateway.
