Technically speaking, it’s just a program running on a computer, making automated requests that reach different websites. We’ve come to refer to these requests as “bots” on the Internet. Bots move quickly, leveraging the efficiency of computers to carry out tasks at scale. The Grinch Bot is a very special type that satisfies two conditions:</p><ol><li><p>It only pursues online inventory, attempting to purchase items before humans can complete their orders.</p></li><li><p>It only operates during the holiday season.</p></li></ol><p>Now, attackers use bots to perform these tasks all year long. But in these winter months, we like to use the term “Grinch Bot” as seasonal terminology.</p><p>The Grinch Bot strikes first around Black Friday. It knows that the best discounts come around Thanksgiving, and it loves to get a good deal. Exclusive items are always the first to go, so attackers use the Grinch Bot to cut every (virtual) line and checkpoint. <b>Cloudflare detected nearly 1.5 trillion bot requests on Black Friday.</b> That’s about half of all our traffic; but more on this in a bit.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/TtyEv5ywy7iQ2L1TcfPQt/93089c12c342ce170ce7f1d01105d159/image2-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"809\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The Grinch Bot strikes again on Cyber Monday. As shoppers find gifts for their loved ones, bots are ten steps ahead — selecting “add to cart” automatically. Many bots have payment details ready (perhaps even stolen from your account!).</p><p>The Grinch Bot will buy 500 pairs of Lululemon joggers before you even get one. And it’ll do so in seconds.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"nearly-44-of-traffic-comes-from-bad-bots\">Nearly 44% of traffic comes from bad bots</h3>\n            <a href=\"#nearly-44-of-traffic-comes-from-bad-bots\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The Grinch Bot has friends working throughout the year, putting pressure on security teams and moving undetected. <b>43.8% of Internet traffic comes from these bots.</b> When the holidays arrive, the Grinch Bot can ask its friends how to attack the largest sites.
