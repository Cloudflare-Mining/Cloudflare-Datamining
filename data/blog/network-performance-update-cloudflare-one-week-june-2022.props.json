The results showed that on a range of tests (TCP connection time, time to first byte, time to last byte), and on different measures (p95, mean), Cloudflare was the fastest provider in 49% of the top 1,000 networks around the world.</p><p>Since then, we’ve expanded our testing to cover not just 1,000 <a href=\"/network-performance-update-platform-week/\">but 3,000 networks</a>, and we’ve worked to continuously improve performance, with the ultimate goal of being the fastest everywhere and an intermediate goal to grow the number of networks where we’re the fastest by at least 10% every Innovation Week.

Moving to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust</a> doesn’t just reduce the need for corporate networks, it also allows user traffic to flow to resources more naturally.</p><p>However, given your Zero Trust provider is going to be the gatekeeper for all your users and all your applications, performance is a critical aspect to evaluate. Cloudflare is constantly improving our network to ensure that users always have the best experience, and this comes not just from routing fixes, but also through expanding peering arrangements and adding new locations.</p><p>This tireless effort helps make us faster in more networks than anyone else, and allows us to deliver all of our services with high performance that customers expect. We know many organizations are just starting their Zero Trust journey, and that a priority of that project is to improve user experience, and we’re excited to keep obsessing over the performance in our network to make sure your teams have a seamless experience in any location.</p><p>Interested in learning more about how our Zero Trust products benefit from these improvements?
