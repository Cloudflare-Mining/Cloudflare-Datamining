That is a big part of why APIs are so prolific today — enabling code (whether your own, or that of a 3rd party) to engage with your applications is nothing short of revolutionary.</p><p>But there’s still a problem. While APIs can give developers the ability to interact with your application programmatically, developers are ultimately always limited by the abstractions exposed to them by the API. You, an application owner, have to have predicted how the customer would use your product, and then built out the API to support the use case. If there’s one thing I have learned as a product manager, it’s almost impossible to predict how customers will use a product. And if there’s a second thing I’ve learned, it’s that even with plentiful engineering resources, it’s also almost impossible to build all the functionality required to keep said customers happy.</p><p>There is another way, however.</p><p>Functions, in contrast to APIs, provide the lowest level primitives (rather than abstractions on top of them). This lets the developer define the right behavior from there — and they can even define their own APIs on top.</p><p>In this sense, functions and APIs are actually complementary to each other — you may even choose to call another API directly from your function. For example, if you’re handling an event in a messaging system, you could implement your own feature to send an email by calling an email API, or create a ticket in your ticketing system, etc.</p><p>This gets at why we’re so excited about Workers for Platforms: it enables you to expose a direct way for your customers’ developers to bring their own logic to any application. We think it’s going to unlock a wave of customer-led innovation on top of companies that adopt it, and has the potential to be as impactful to building applications on the web as the API has been.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"a-better-experience-for-developers\">A better experience for developers</h2>\n      <a href=\"#a-better-experience-for-developers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>While Workers for Platforms expose a more powerful paradigm for making product programmable, they also result in a better experience for you as a developer.</p><p>Today, as a developer, before you can even get started using APIs or webhooks, there’s a list of tedious tasks you have to deal with first.

While <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/features-page-rules/\">Page Rules</a> offered a way to modify behavior by URL, customers wanted to control behavior based on cookie, header, geolocation, and more!</p><p>We realized our engineering team couldn’t keep up with every request, so we decided to allow customers to bend our product to their own needs.</p><p>As we looked for an approach to this problem, we looked for a solution that would meet the two following requirements:</p><ol><li><p>Performance requirement: it’s unacceptable for a CDN, which should make your site faster to introduce latency. How do we make this so fast you don’t even notice it’s there?</p></li><li><p>Security requirement: how do we run untrusted code securely?</p></li></ol><p>While these requirements are especially critical when you offer performance and security products, solving these challenges is critical when giving your customers the ability to program your product. If the function needs to run on the critical path to your user, introducing latency is equally unacceptable. And of course, no one wants to get breached just to have their users be able to program.</p><p>Creating a really fast and secure multi-tenant environment is no easy feat.</p><p>When we evaluated our options for solving this problem, we first turned to technologies that existed for solving this problem on the server — serverless functions already existed at time, but were powered by containers, which would introduce cold-start, which was, well, a non-starter. So we <a href=\"/workers-open-source-announcement/\">turned to the browser</a>, or specifically Chrome, which was powered by V8, and decided to take the same approach, and run it on our servers.</p><p>And while the approach sounds simple (and perhaps in retrospect obvious, as these things tend to seem), running a large multi-tenant development platform at scale is no small effort. If a part of the purpose of allowing customers to program your offering is to free up engineering efforts to focus on building new features, the effort it takes to maintain and scale such a development platform may defeat the purpose.</p><p>What we realized recently was that we weren’t alone in trying to solve this problem.</p><p>Companies like Shopify, building their next generation programmable storefront, Oxygen, were trying to solve the same thing. They wanted to enable their customers to run custom storefronts, and be able to offer the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/\">best performance possible</a>, while maintaining a secure, multi-tenant environment.</p><blockquote><p>“Shopify is the Internet’s commerce infrastructure, with millions of merchants using the platform,” said Zach Koch, product director, custom storefronts, at Shopify. “Partnering with Cloudflare, we’re able to give developers the tools they need to build unique and performant storefronts. We are excited to work with Cloudflare to alleviate some complexities of building commerce experiences – like scalability and global availability – so that developers can instead focus on what makes their brand distinct.”</p></blockquote>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-can-you-build-your-next-platform-on-workers-for-platforms\">How can you build your next platform on Workers for Platforms?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-can-you-build-your-next-platform-on-workers-for-platforms\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Working with platforms like Shopify to help them address their developers’ needs, helped us realize another thing — developer experience is not one-size-fits-all.
