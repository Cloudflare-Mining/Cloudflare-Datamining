That remains unsettling, but it is not surprising that a phone company&#39;s voicemail security procedures are lax. It is also unsettling that Gmail&#39;s account recovery process appears to still be vulnerable to the voicemail hack. That is troubling since it means if a hacker knows your phone number then your Gmail account may, at best, only be as secure as your voicemail PIN.</p><p>You can mitigate these risk if you are a user by enabling two-factor authentication, ideally relying on Google&#39;s Authenticator App rather than anything that passes through the phone company&#39;s network. While Google is advising otherwise, I have removed my phone number from all my Google accounts.</p><p>Google has publicly stated that the flaw in the Google Enterprise App account recovery process has been patched and you can no longer use it get around two-factor authentication. Again, since any security system is only as strong as its weakest link, we would recommend using an out-of-band authentication that doesn&#39;t rely on the phone company&#39;s network (e.g., Google Authenticator App, not SMS or voice verification).</p><p>Finally, CloudFlare has stopped BCCing password reset and other transactional messages to administrative accounts, closing that attack vector if an administrator&#39;s email account is compromised in the future. If you&#39;re doing that at your company, and a troubling number of companies do use email as a poor man&#39;s logs, you should stop. This incident is why.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h3>\n            <a href=\"#timeline\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The event, from start to finish, lasted less than 2 hours.
