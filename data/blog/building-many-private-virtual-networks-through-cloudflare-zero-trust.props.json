More than ever, those employees may be roaming, remote, or actually in a company office. Regardless, you need to ensure only they can access your private services. Even then, you want to have granular control over what each user can access within your network.</p><p>This is where Cloudflare can help you. We make our <a href=\"/private-networking/\">global, performant network</a> available to you, acting as a virtual bridge between your employees and private services. With your employees’ devices running <a href=\"/warp-for-desktop/\">Cloudflare WARP</a>, their traffic egresses through Cloudflare’s network. On the other side, your private services are behind <a href=\"/highly-available-and-highly-scalable-cloudflare-tunnels/\">Cloudflare Tunnel</a>, accessible only through Cloudflare’s network. Together, these connectors protect your virtual private network end to end.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1vkHuzVWGNrTZdH3vU2S3P/c35fc8dae6e3d169ac4217b931bb64d0/942-1.png\" alt=\"Architecture depicting client applications accessing private origins behind cloudflared Tunnel through our Cloudflare Global Network with Zero Trust.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"753\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The beauty of this setup is that your traffic is immediately faster <b>and</b> more secure. But you can then take it a step further and extract value from many Cloudflare services for your <a href=\"/private-networking/\">private network routed traffic</a>: auditing, fine-grained filtering, data loss protection, malware detection, safe browsing, and many others.</p><p>Our customers are already in love with our Zero Trust private network routing solution.

For example, this means typing <i>jira.intra</i> in the browser or SSH-ing to a private IP <code><i>10.1.2.3</i></code> will work seamlessly despite neither of those private services being exposed to the Internet.</p><p>However, this has a big assumption in place: those underlying private IPs are assumed to be unique in the private networks connected to Cloudflare in the customer’s account.</p><p>Suppose now that your Team has two (or more) data centers that use the same IP space — usually referred to as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing\">CIDR</a> — such as <code>10.1.0.0/16</code>. Maybe one is the current primary and the other is the secondary, replicating one another. In such an example situation, there would exist a machine in each of those two data centers, both with the same IP, <code><i>10.1.2.3</i></code>.</p><p>Until today, you could not set up that via Cloudflare. You would connect data center 1 with a Cloudflare Tunnel responsible for traffic to <code>10.1.0.0/16</code>. You would then do the same in data center 2, but receive an error forbidding you to create an ambiguous IP route:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cloudflared tunnel route ip add 10.1.0.0/16 dc-2-tunnel\n\nAPI error: Failed to add route: code: 1014, reason: You already have a route defined for this exact IP subnet</pre></code>\n            <p>In an ideal world, a team would not have this problem: every private network would have unique IP space. But that is just not feasible in practice, particularly for large enterprises. Consider the case where two companies merge: it is borderline impossible to expect them to rearrange their private networks to preserve IP addressing uniqueness.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"getting-started-on-your-new-virtual-networks\">Getting started on your new virtual networks</h3>\n            <a href=\"#getting-started-on-your-new-virtual-networks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>You can now overcome the problem above by creating unique virtual networks that logically segregate your overlapping IP routes.

The WARP client then restarts its connectivity to our network, breaking existing TCP connections that were being routed to the previously selected virtual network. This may be perceived as if you were disconnecting and reconnecting the WARP client.</p><p>Every current Cloudflare Zero Trust organization using private network routing will now have a default virtual network encompassing the IP Routes to Cloudflare Tunnels. You can start using the commands above to expand your private network to have overlapping IPs and reassign a default virtual network if desired.</p><p>If you do not have overlapping IPs in your private infrastructure, no action will be required.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next</h2>\n            <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>This is just the beginning of our support for distinct virtual networks at Cloudflare.
