	<p>The 2024 Summer Olympics, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics">Paris 2024</a>, is set from July 26 to August 11 in France. The <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/the-games/ceremonies/opening-ceremony">opening ceremony</a>, scheduled for Friday, July 26 at 17:30, will take place for the first time not in a stadium but in the open space of the Jardins du Trocadéro by the Seine River in Paris. We’ll monitor relevant Internet insights throughout the event, but here we analyze some pre-event trends, from the popularity of Olympic websites by country to the increase in Olympics-related spam and malicious emails.</p>
	<p>This year’s Olympics will host 329 events across 32 sports, featuring the debut of breakdancing as an Olympic event and the return of skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing from 2020. Similar to our <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/elections-2024">2024 elections coverage</a>, we will maintain a <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/paris-2024-olympics"><b>Paris 2024 Olympics report</b></a> on Cloudflare Radar, updating it as significant Internet trends related to the event emerge.</p>
	<p>From our <a href="http://1.1.1.1">1.1.1.1</a> resolver, DNS trends show heightened interest in the Olympics, especially from France. 24% of DNS requests for official Olympic-related websites came from the host country, followed by the United Kingdom and the United States, with 20% and 17% respectively.</p>

	<p>On April 10, 2024, DNS traffic spikes were observed not just in France but also notably in Germany, Russia, and the US, among others. Despite France leading in overall DNS traffic to Olympic sites since January, as seen on the world map above, this particular day saw the largest spikes originating from other countries. These spikes were most prominent from Germany, Russia, the US, the UK, France, Brazil, and Australia, in that order.</p>
	<p>What caused these spikes? Several <a href="https://www.francsjeux.com/en/short/more-than-a-thousand-jobs-to-be-filled-at-cojo">press conferences</a> related to the Olympics took place that day. One major announcement, covered globally, declared that for the first time, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/world-athletics-olympic-prize-money-867d25da6c5a25abbaef5b5859f4e780">Olympics would offer prize money</a>, with track and field gold medalists receiving $50,000. The following chart illustrates the spike in DNS traffic in these countries on that day.</p>

	<p>In France, the host nation, ticket sale days significantly influenced DNS traffic to official Olympic websites. The most obvious spike occurred on February 8, 2024, marking the start of the first phase of ticket sales for 2024, called the “<a href="https://press.paris2024.org/news/new-tickets-for-the-games-on-sale-on-8-february-c50f-7578a.html">Paris 2024 official ticketing website surprise releases</a>.” On that day, daily DNS traffic was double that of the previous week. A significant surge was also observed at 10:00 local time, coinciding with the ticket release, which saw an hourly DNS traffic increase of 398% compared to the previous week.</p>

	<p>The week of March 3, 2024, saw the highest DNS traffic to Olympic-related sites in France so far.

	<p>From a cybersecurity perspective, as major events often attract phishing and spam, we’ve analyzed email trends related to the Olympics—recently we did the same for the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-first-2024-us-presidential-debate-influenced-internet-traffic-and-security-trends">Biden vs Trump US presidential debate</a>. From January 2024 up to late-July, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security">Cloudflare’s Cloud Email Security</a> service processed well over half a million emails containing “Olympics” or “Paris 2024” in the subject. The week of July 15 saw the highest number of such emails, marking a 694% increase compared to the busiest week in January.</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

		<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/56XDVuTBPipGTCt2xsMWSP/709958e75e44be2de6f1d90c3e17da79/unnamed--3--6.png" alt="" class="kg-image" width="1600" height="462" loading="lazy">

	</figure>
	<p>Regarding unwanted messages, spam accounted for 1.5% of all emails with “Olympics” or “Paris 2024” in the subject, while malicious emails made up 0.2%. This means that in a sample of 1000 emails, roughly 15 would be spam and about 2 would be malicious. The week with the highest percentage of malicious Olympic-related emails was May 6, with 0.6% classified as malicious. Declining after that peak, it ticked back up in July, to 0.4% on July 8.</p>
