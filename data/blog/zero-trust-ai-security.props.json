Users can ask questions, solicit feedback, and lean on the service to create output from poetry to <a href=\"https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2022/five-minute-ai-site\">Cloudflare Workers applications</a>.</p><p>The tools also bear an uncanny resemblance to a real human. As in some real-life personal conversations, oversharing can become a <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/samsung-chatgpt-leak-details\">serious problem</a> with these AI services. This risk multiplies due to the types of use cases where LLM models thrive. These tools can help developers solve difficult coding challenges or information workers create succinct reports from a mess of notes. While helpful, every input fed into a prompt becomes a piece of data leaving your organization’s control.</p><p>Some responses to tools like ChatGPT have been to try and ban the service outright; either at a corporate level or across an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/germany-principle-could-block-chat-gpt-if-needed-data-protection-chief-2023-04-03/\">entire nation</a>. We don’t think you should have to do that. Cloudflare One’s goal is to allow you to safely use the tools you need, wherever they live, without compromising performance. These features will feel familiar to any existing use of the Zero Trust products in Cloudflare One, but we’re excited to walk through cases where you can use the tools available right now to allow your team to take advantage of the latest LLM features.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"measure-usage\">Measure usage</h3>\n      <a href=\"#measure-usage\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>SaaS applications make it easy for any user to sign up and start testing. That convenience also makes these tools a liability for IT budgets and security policies. Teams refer to this problem as “<a href=\"/introducing-shadow-it-discovery/\">Shadow IT</a>” - the adoption of applications and services outside the approved channels in an organization.</p><p>In terms of budget, we have heard from early adopter customers who know that their team members are beginning to experiment with LLMs, but they are not sure how to approach making a commercial licensing decision. What services and features do their users need and how many seats should they purchase?</p><p>On the security side, the AIs can be revolutionary for getting work done but terrifying for data control policies. Team members treat these AIs like sounding boards for painful problems. The services invite users to come with their questions or challenges. Sometimes the context inside those prompts can contain sensitive information that should never leave an organization. Even if teams select and approve a single vendor, members of your organization might prefer another AI and continue to use it in their workflow.</p><p>Cloudflare One customers on any plan <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/analytics/access/\">can now review</a> the usage of AIs. Your IT department can deploy Cloudflare Gateway and passively observe how many users are selecting which services as a way to start scoping out enterprise licensing plans.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2uHrL23faFCHE9540fQFp0/c7fbebb109d03999ebaf94fc39890805/image6-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1879\" height=\"682\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Administrators can also block the use of these services with a single click, but that is not our goal today. You might want to use this feature if you select ChatGPT as your approved model, and you want to make sure team members don’t continue to use alternatives, but we hope you don’t block all of these services outright. Cloudflare’s priority is to give you the ability to use these tools safely.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"control-api-access\">Control API access</h3>\n      <a href=\"#control-api-access\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>When our teams began experimenting with OpenAI’s ChatGPT service, we were astonished by what it already knew about Cloudflare. We asked ChatGPT to create applications with <a href=\"https://workers.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Workers</a> or guide us through how to configure a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/\">Cloudflare Access</a> policy and, in most cases, the results were accurate and helpful.</p><p>In some cases the results missed the mark. The AIs were using outdated information, or we were asking questions about features that had only launched recently. Thankfully, these AIs can learn and we can help. We can train these models with scoped inputs and <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins\">connect plug-ins</a> to provide our customers with better AI-guided experiences when using Cloudflare services.</p><p>We heard from customers who want to do the same thing and, like us, they need to securely share training data and grant plug-in access for an AI service. Cloudflare One’s security suite extends beyond human users and can give teams the ability to securely share Zero Trust access to sensitive data over APIs.</p><p>First, teams can create <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/service-tokens/\">service tokens</a> that external services must present to reach data made available through Cloudflare One. Administrators can provide these tokens to systems making API requests and log every single request. As needed, teams can revoke these tokens with a single click.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5MImi9GeUWltY5DOFwvMSh/c2d8358832bd18a88bdbc5e38bd12fb5/download-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1317\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>After creating and issuing service tokens, administrators can create policies to allow specific services access to their training data. These policies will verify the service token and can be extended to verify country, IP address or an mTLS certificate. Policies can also be created to require human users to authenticate with an identity provider and complete an MFA prompt before accessing sensitive training data or services.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6AsBiCcSRRs2cB0fX91qFb/d6235e9b8e6ab10b8b1370811aa8336f/download--1--4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1100\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When teams are ready to allow an AI service to connect to their infrastructure, they can do so without poking holes in their firewalls by using <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/\">Cloudflare Tunnel</a>.
