Throughout the process we found and have fully patched vulnerabilities discovered in Cloudflare Pages.

In this post we share information about the research that could help others make their infrastructure more secure, and also highlight our bug bounty program that helps to make our product more secure.</i></p><p>Cloudflare cares deeply about security and protecting our users and customers — in fact, it’s a big part of the reason we’re here. But how does this manifest in terms of how we run our business? There are a number of ways. One very important prong of this is our <a href=\"/cloudflare-bug-bounty-program/\">bug bounty program</a> that facilitates and rewards security researchers for their collaboration with us.</p><p>But we don’t just fix the security issues we learn about — in order to build trust with our customers and the community more broadly, we are transparent about incidents and bugs that we find.</p><p>Recently, we worked with a group of researchers on improving the security of Cloudflare Pages. This collaboration resulted in several security vulnerability discoveries that we quickly fixed. We have no evidence that malicious actors took advantage of the vulnerabilities found. Regardless, we notified the limited number of customers that might have been exposed.</p><p>In this post we are publicly sharing what we learned, and the steps we took to remediate what was identified. We are thankful for the collaboration with the researchers, and encourage others to <a href=\"http://hackerone.com/cloudflare\">use the bounty program</a> to work with us to help us make our services — and by extension the Internet — more secure!</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"what-happens-when-a-vulnerability-is-reported\">What happens when a vulnerability is reported?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#what-happens-when-a-vulnerability-is-reported\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Once a vulnerability has been reported via HackerOne, it flows into our vulnerability management process:</p><ol><li><p>We investigate the issue to understand the criticality of the report.</p></li><li><p>We work with the engineering teams to scope, implement, and validate a fix to the problem.

Like all complex engineering problems, getting this right has been an iterative process. In all cases, we were able to quickly and definitively address bugs reported by security researchers. However, as we continued to work through reports by the researchers, it became clear that our initial build architecture decisions provided too large an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-an-attack-surface/\">attack surface</a>. The Pages team pivoted entirely and re-architected our platform in order to use gVisor and further isolate builds.</p><p>When determining impact, it is not enough to find no evidence that a bug was exploited, <i>we must conclusively prove that it was not exploited</i>. For almost all the bugs reported, we found definitive signals in audit logs and were able to correlate that data exclusively against activity by trusted security researchers.</p><p>However, for one bug, <i>while we found no evidence that the bug was exploited beyond the work of security researchers</i>, we were not able meaningfully prove that it was not. In the spirit of full transparency, we notified all Pages users that may have been impacted.</p><p>Now that all the issues have been remedied, and individual customers have been notified, we’d like to share more information about the issues.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"bug-1-command-injection-in-clone_repo\">Bug 1: Command injection in CLONE_REPO</h3>\n      <a href=\"#bug-1-command-injection-in-clone_repo\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>With a flaw in our logic during build initialization, it was possible to execute arbitrary code, echo environment variables to a file and then read the contents of that file.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4xCsRLGOMLRsVRAAbQBjXM/98cc4254afa79a1e21b503f2a3cb94a4/image2-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1066\" height=\"46\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The crux of the bug was that <code>root_dir</code> in this line of code was attacker controlled.

One of these changes was migration of the product from Azure to Kubernetes, and simplifying the workflow, so the attack surface was smaller and defensive programming practices were easier to implement. After the change, Pages builds are within Kubernetes Pods and are seeded with the minimum set of credentials needed.</p><p>As part of this migration, we left off a very important iptables rule in our Kubernetes control plane, making it easy to <code>curl</code> the Kubernetes API and read secrets related to other Pods in the cluster (each Pod representing a separate Pages build).</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">curl -v -k [http://10.124.200.1:10255/pods](http://10.124.200.1:10255/pods)</pre></code>\n            <p>We quickly patched this issue with iptables rules to block network connections to the Kubernetes control plane. One of the secrets available to each Pod was the GitHub OAuth secret which would have allowed someone who exploited this issue to read the GitHub repositories of other Pages&#39; customers.</p><p>In the previously reported issues we had robust logs that showed us that the attacks that were being performed had never been performed by anyone else. The logs related to inspecting Pods were not available to us, so we decided to notify all Cloudflare Pages customers that had ever had a build run on our Kubernetes-based infrastructure. After patching the issue and investigating which customers were impacted, we emailed impacted customers on February 3 to tell them that it’s possible someone other than the researcher had exploited this issue, because our logs couldn’t prove otherwise.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"takeaways\">Takeaways</h2>\n      <a href=\"#takeaways\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We are thankful for all the security research performed on our Pages product, and done so at such an incredible depth. CI/CD and build infrastructure security problems are notoriously hard to prevent. A bug bounty that incentivizes researchers to keep coming back is invaluable, and we appreciate working with researchers who were flexible enough to perform great research, and work with us as we re-architected the product for more robustness. An in-depth write-up of these issues is available from the Assetnote team on <a href=\"https://blog.assetnote.io/2022/05/06/cloudflare-pages-pt1/\">their website</a>.</p><p>More than this, however, the work of all these researchers is one of the best ways to test the security architecture of any product. While it might seem counter-intuitive after a post listing out a number of bugs, all these diligent eyes on our products allow us to feel much more confident in the security architecture of Cloudflare Pages. We hope that our transparency, and our description of the work done on our security posture, enables you to feel more confident, too.</p><p>Finally: if you are a security researcher, we’d love to work with you to make our products more secure.
