We&#39;ve designed an RPC system so expressive that calling a remote service can feel like using a library – without any need to actually import a library! This is important not just for ease of use, but also security: fewer dependencies means fewer critical security updates and less exposure to supply-chain attacks.</p><p>To this end, here are some of the features of Workers RPC:</p><ul><li><p>For starters, you can pass <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm#supported_types\"><b>Structured Clonable</b></a> <b>types</b> as the params or return value of an RPC. (That means that, unlike JSON, Dates just work, and you can even have cycles.)</p></li><li><p>You can additionally pass <b>functions</b> in the params or return value of other functions. When the other side calls the function you passed to it, they make a new RPC back to you.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, you can pass <b>objects with methods</b>. Method calls become further RPCs.</p></li><li><p>RPC to another Worker (over a Service Binding) usually does not even cross a network. In fact, the other Worker usually runs in the very same thread as the caller, <b>reducing latency to zero</b>. Performance-wise, it’s almost as fast as an actual function call.</p></li><li><p>When RPC does cross a network (e.g. to a Durable Object), you can invoke a method and then speculatively invoke further methods on the result in a <b>single network round trip</b>.</p></li><li><p>You can send a <b>byte stream over RPC</b>, and the system will automatically stream the bytes with proper flow control.</p></li><li><p>All of this is <i>secure</i>, based on the <b>object-capability model</b>.</p></li><li><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/blob/03629a6553751d3614a8b91926e380213e100d94/src/workerd/io/worker-interface.capnp#L302\">protocol</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/blob/03629a6553751d3614a8b91926e380213e100d94/src/workerd/api/worker-rpc.c++\">implementation</a> are fully open source as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/\">workerd</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Workers RPC is a JavaScript-native RPC system. Under the hood, it is built on <a href=\"https://capnproto.org/rpc.html\">Cap&#39;n Proto</a>. However, unlike Cap&#39;n Proto, Workers RPC does not require you to write a schema. (Of course, you can use TypeScript if you like, and we provide tools to help with this.)</p><p>In general, Workers RPC is designed to &quot;just work&quot; using idiomatic JavaScript code, so you shouldn&#39;t have to spend too much time looking at docs. We&#39;ll give you an overview in this blog post. But if you want to understand the full feature set, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/\">check out the documentation</a>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"why-rpc-and-what-is-rpc-anyway\">Why RPC?

Without RPC, you might communicate using a protocol like HTTP. With HTTP, though, you must format and parse your communications as an HTTP request and response, perhaps designed in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST\">REST</a> style. RPC systems try to make communications look like a regular function call instead, as if you were calling a library rather than a remote service. The RPC system provides a &quot;stub&quot; object on the client side which stands in for the real server-side object. When a method is called on the stub, the RPC system figures out how to serialize and transmit the parameters to the server, invoke the method on the server, and then transmit the return value back.</p><p>The merits of RPC have been subject to a great deal of debate. RPC is often accused of committing many of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing\">fallacies of distributed computing</a>.</p><p>But this reputation is outdated. When RPC was first invented some 40 years ago, async programming barely existed. We did not have Promises, much less async and await. Early RPC was synchronous: calls would block the calling thread waiting for a reply. At best, latency made the program slow. At worst, network failures would hang or crash the program. No wonder it was deemed &quot;broken&quot;.</p><p>Things are different today. We have Promise and async and await, and we can throw exceptions on network failures. We even understand how RPCs can be pipelined so that a chain of calls takes only one network round trip. Many large distributed systems you likely use every day are built on RPC. It works.</p><p>The fact is, RPC fits the programming model we&#39;re used to. Every programmer is trained to think in terms of APIs composed of function calls, not in terms of byte stream protocols nor even REST. Using RPC frees you from the need to constantly translate between mental models, allowing you to move faster.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"example-authentication-service\">Example: Authentication Service</h2>\n      <a href=\"#example-authentication-service\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Here&#39;s a common scenario: You have one Worker that implements an application, and another Worker that is responsible for authenticating user credentials. The app Worker needs to call the auth Worker on each request to check the user&#39;s cookie.</p><p>This example uses a <b>Service Binding</b>, which is a way of configuring one Worker with a private channel to talk to another, without going through a public URL. Here, we have an application Worker that has been configured with a service binding to the Auth worker.</p><p>Before RPC, all communications between Workers needed to use HTTP. So, you might write code like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// OLD STYLE: HTTP-based service bindings.\nexport default {\n  async fetch(req, env, ctx) {\n    // Call the auth service to authenticate the user&#039;s cookie.\n    // We send it an HTTP request using a service binding.\n\n    // Construct a JSON request to the auth service.\n    let authRequest = {\n      cookie: req.headers.get(&quot;Cookie&quot;)\n    };\n\n    // Send it to env.AUTH_SERVICE, which is our service binding\n    // to the auth worker.\n    let resp = await env.AUTH_SERVICE.fetch(\n        &quot;https://auth/check-cookie&quot;, {\n      method: &quot;POST&quot;,\n      headers: {\n        &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json; charset=utf-8&quot;,\n      },\n      body: JSON.stringify(authRequest)\n    });\n\n    if (!resp.ok) {\n      return new Response(&quot;Internal Server Error&quot;, {status: 500});\n    }\n\n    // Parse the JSON result.\n    let authResult = await resp.json();\n\n    // Use the result.\n    if (!authResult.authorized) {\n      return new Response(&quot;Not authorized&quot;, {status: 403});\n    }\n    let username = authResult.username;\n\n    return new Response(`Hello, ${username}!`);\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>Meanwhile, your auth server might look like:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// OLD STYLE: HTTP-based auth server.\nexport default {\n  async fetch(req, env, ctx) {\n    // Parse URL to decide what endpoint is being called.\n    let url = new URL(req.url);\n    if (url.pathname == &quot;/check-cookie&quot;) {\n      // Parse the request.\n      let authRequest = await req.json();\n\n      // Look up cookie in Workers KV.\n      let cookieInfo = await env.COOKIE_MAP.get(\n          hash(authRequest.cookie), &quot;json&quot;);\n\n      // Construct the response.\n      let result;\n      if (cookieInfo) {\n        result = {\n          authorized: true,\n          username: cookieInfo.username\n        };\n      } else {\n        result = { authorized: false };\n      }\n\n      return Response.json(result);\n    } else {\n      return new Response(&quot;Not found&quot;, {status: 404});\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>This code has a lot of boilerplate involved in setting up an HTTP request to the auth service.

It implements a &quot;wildcard method&quot;, that is, it appears to have an infinite number of methods of every possible name.

We made an object! We called it! It all just felt natural, like calling a local API! Hooray!</p><p>But there&#39;s another extremely important property that the AuthService API has which you may have missed: <b>As designed, you cannot perform any operation on a user without first checking the cookie.</b> This is true despite the fact that the individual method calls do not require sending the cookie again, and the User object itself doesn&#39;t store the cookie.</p><p>The trick is, the initial checkCookie() RPC is what returns a User object in the first place. The AuthService API does not provide any other way to obtain a User instance. The RPC client cannot create a User object out of thin air, and cannot call methods of an object without first explicitly receiving a reference to it.</p><p>This is called capability-based security: we say that the User reference received by the client is a &quot;capability&quot;, because receiving it grants the client the ability to perform operations on the user. The getProfile() method grants this capability only when the client has presented the correct cookie.</p><p>Capability-based security is often like this: security can be woven naturally into your APIs, rather than feel like an additional concern bolted on top.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"more-security-named-entrypoints\">More security: Named entrypoints</h3>\n      <a href=\"#more-security-named-entrypoints\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Another subtle but important detail to call out: in the above example, the auth service&#39;s RPC API is exported as a named class:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">export class AuthService extends WorkerEntrypoint {</pre></code>\n            <p>And in our wrangler.toml for the calling worker, we had to specify an &quot;entrypoint&quot;, matching the class name:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">entrypoint = &quot;AuthService&quot;  # name of the exported RPC class</pre></code>\n            <p>In the past, service bindings would bind to the &quot;default&quot; entrypoint, declared with export default {. But, the default entrypoint is also typically exposed to the Internet, e.g. automatically mapped to a hostname under workers.dev (unless you explicitly turn that off). It can be tricky to safely assume that requests arriving at this entrypoint are in any way trusted.</p><p>With named entrypoints, this all changes. A named entrypoint is only accessible to Workers which have explicitly declared a binding to it. By default, only Workers on your own account can declare such bindings. Moreover, the binding must be declared at deploy time; a Worker cannot create new service bindings at runtime.</p><p>Thus, you can trust that requests arriving at a named entrypoint can only have come from Workers on your account and for which you explicitly created a service binding. In the future, we plan to extend this pattern further with the ability to lock down entrypoints, audit which Workers have bindings to them, tell the callee information about who is calling at runtime, and so on. With these tools, there is no need to write code in your app itself to authenticate access to internal APIs; the system does it for you.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"what-about-type-safety\">What about type safety?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#what-about-type-safety\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Workers RPC works in an entirely dynamically-typed way, just as JavaScript itself does.

Although it isn&#39;t explicitly a security feature, it is commonly provided by object-capability RPC systems like Cap&#39;n Proto.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"the-future-custom-bindings-marketplace\">The future: Custom Bindings Marketplace?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#the-future-custom-bindings-marketplace\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>For now, Service Bindings and Durable Objects only allow communication between Workers running on the same account. So, RPC can only be used to talk between your own Workers.</p><p>But we&#39;d like to take it further.</p><p>We have previously explained <a href=\"/workers-environment-live-object-bindings\">why Workers environments contain live objects</a>, also known as &quot;bindings&quot;. But today, only Cloudflare can add new binding types to the Workers platform – like Queues, KV, or D1. But what if <i>anyone</i> could invent their own binding type, and give it to other people?</p><p>Previously, we thought this would require creating a way to automatically load client libraries into the calling Workers. That seemed scary: it meant using someone&#39;s binding would require trusting their code to run inside your isolate. With RPC, there&#39;s no such trust. The binding only sees exactly what you explicitly pass to it. It cannot compromise the rest of your Worker.</p><p>Could Workers RPC provide the basis for a &quot;bindings marketplace&quot;, where people can offer rich JavaScript APIs to each other in an easy and secure way? We&#39;re excited to explore and find out.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"try-it-now\">Try it now</h2>\n      <a href=\"#try-it-now\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Workers RPC is available today for all Workers users.
