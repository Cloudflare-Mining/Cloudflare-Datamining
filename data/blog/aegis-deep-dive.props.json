This firewall mechanism is a starting state that just about every server supports. As we built Cloudflare’s network, one of the first features that customers requested was the ability to restrict access to their origin, so only Cloudflare could make requests to it. Back then, the most natural way to support this was to tell our customers which IP addresses belong to us, so they could allowlist those in their origin firewall. To that end, we have published our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/\"><u>IP address ranges</u></a>, providing an easy configuration to ensure that all traffic accessing your origin comes from Cloudflare’s network.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4I2fP03AeszxuHL78Ap9lA/bf75dcb9259b8b97b73f55831b3c019f/BLOG-2609_2.png\" alt=\"BLOG-2609 2\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1920\" height=\"654\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>However, Cloudflare’s IP ranges are used across multiple Cloudflare services and customers, so restricting access to the full list doesn’t necessarily give customers the security benefit they need.

A request egresses from exactly one port on the Aegis IP address to exactly one port on the origin IP address. </p><p>Each TCP request consists of a 4-way tuple that contains:</p><ol><li><p>Source IP address</p></li><li><p>Source port</p></li><li><p>Destination IP address</p></li><li><p>Destination port</p></li></ol><p>A <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-udp-sockets-but-were-afraid-to-ask-part-1/\"><u>UDP request</u></a> can also consist of a 4-way tuple (if it’s connected) or a 2-way tuple (if it’s unconnected), simply including a bind IP address and port. Aegis supports both TCP and UDP traffic — in either case, the requests rely upon IP:port pairings between the source and destination. </p><p>When a request reaches the origin, it opens a <i>connection</i>, through which data can pass between the source and destination. One source port can sustain multiple connections at a time, <i>only</i> if the destination ip:ports are different. </p><p>Normally at Cloudflare, an IP address establishes connections to a variety of different destination IP ports or addresses to support high traffic volumes. With Aegis, that is no longer the case. The challenge with Aegis IP capacity is exactly that: all the traffic is egressing to the same (or a small set of) origin IP address(es) from the same (or a small set of) source IP address(es). That means Aegis IP addresses have capacity constraints associated with them.</p><p>The number of <i>concurrent connections</i> is the number of simultaneous connections for a given 4-way tuple. Between one client and one server, the volume of concurrent connections is inherently limited by the number of ports on an IP address to 65,535 — each source ip:port can only support a single outbound connection per destination IP:port. In practice, that maximum number of concurrent connections is often lower due to assignments of port ranges across many servers and imperfect load distribution. </p><p>For planning purposes, we use an estimate of ~80% of the IP capacity (the volume of concurrent connections a source IP address can support to a destination IP address) to protect against overload, in case of traffic spikes. If every port on an IP address is maintaining a concurrent connection, that address would reach and exceed capacity — it would be overloaded with port usage exhaustion. Requests may then be dropped since no new connections can be established. To build in resiliency, we only plan to support 40k concurrent connections per Aegis IP address per origin.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"aegis-with-ipv6\">Aegis with IPv6</h3>\n            <a href=\"#aegis-with-ipv6\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Each customer who onboards with Cloudflare Aegis receives two <a href=\"https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing/#:~:text=of%20IPv6%20addresses.-,IPv6%20Relative%20Network%20Sizes,-/128\"><u>/64 prefixes</u></a> to be globally allocated and announced.

When you onboard to Aegis, we work with you to determine the ideal number of IPv4 addresses for your Aegis configuration to maintain optimal performance and resiliency, while also ensuring cost efficiency. </p><p>Naturally, this introduces a bottleneck — whereas every Cloudflare data center can serve as a point of egress with Aegis IPv6, only a small fraction will have that capability with Aegis IPv4. We aim to mitigate this impact by careful provisioning of the IPv4 addresses. </p><p>Now that BYOIP for Aegis is supported, you can also onboard an entire IPv4 <a href=\"https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing/#:~:text=in%20that%20%E2%80%9Cblock%E2%80%9D.-,IPv4,-The%20size%20of\"><u>/24</u></a> prefix or IPv6 /64 for Aegis, allowing for a cost-effective configuration with a much higher volume of capacity.</p><p>When we launched Aegis, each IP address was allocated to one data center, requiring at least two IPv4 addresses for appropriate resiliency. To reduce the number of IP addresses necessary in your layer 3 firewall allowlist, and to manage the cost to the customer of leasing IPs, we expanded our Aegis functionality so that one address can be announced from up to four data centers. To do this, we essentially slice the available IP port range into four subsets and provision each at a unique data center. </p><p>A quick refresher: when a request travels through Cloudflare, it first hits our network via an <i>ingress data center</i>. The ingress data center is generally near the eyeball, who is sending the request. Then, the request is routed following BGP – or <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-smart-routing/\"><u>Argo Smart Routing</u></a>, when enabled – to an <i>exit, or egress, data center</i>. The exit data center will generally fall in close geographic proximity to the request’s destination, which is the customer origin. This mitigates latency induced by the final hop from Cloudflare’s network to your origin.</p><p>With Aegis, the possible exit data centers are limited to the data centers in which an Aegis IP address has been allocated. For IPv6, this is a non-issue, since every data center outside our China Network is covered. With IPv4, however, the exit data centers are limited to a much smaller number (4 x the number of Aegis IPs). Aegis IP addresses are allocated, then, to data centers in close geographic proximity to your origin(s). This maximizes the likelihood that whichever data centers would ordinarily have been selected as the egress data center are already announcing Aegis IP addresses. Theoretically, no extra hop is necessary from the optimal exit data center to an Aegis-enabled data center – they are one and the same. In practice, this cannot be guaranteed 100% of the time because optimal routes are ever-changing. We recommend IPv6 to ensure optimal performance because of this possibility of an extra hop with IPv4.</p><p>A brief comparison, to summarize:</p><table><tr><th><p>\n</p></th><th><p><b>Aegis IPv4</b></p></th><th><p><b>Aegis IPv6</b></p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Physical points of egress</p></td><td><p>4 physical data center sites (1-2 cities near origin) per IP address</p></td><td><p>All 300+ Cloudflare <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\"><u>locations</u></a> (excluding China network)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Capacity</p></td><td><p>One IPv4 address per 40,000 concurrent connections per origin</p></td><td><p>Two /64 prefixes for all Aegis customers (&gt;36 quintillion IP addresses)</p><p>~50,000x capacity of IPv4 config</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pricing model</p></td><td><p>Monthly fee based on IPv4 leases or BYOIP for Aegis prefix fees</p></td><td><p>Included with product purchase or BYOIP for Aegis prefix fees</p></td></tr></table><p>Now, with Aegis analytics coming soon, customers can monitor and manage their IP address usage by Cloudflare data centers in aggregate. Every Cloudflare data center will now run a service with the sole purpose of calculating and reporting Aegis usage for each origin IP:port at regular intervals. Written to an internal database, these reports will be aggregated and exposed to customers via Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/\"><u>GraphQL Analytics API</u></a>. Several aggregation functions will be available, such as average usage over a period of time, or total summed usage.</p><p>This will allow customers to track their own IP address usage to further optimize the distribution of traffic and addresses across different points of presence for IPv4. Additionally, the improved observability will support customer-created notifications via RSS feeds such that you can design your own notification thresholds for port usage.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-aegis-benefits-from-connection-reuse-coalescence\">How Aegis benefits from connection reuse &amp; coalescence</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-aegis-benefits-from-connection-reuse-coalescence\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As we mentioned earlier, requests egress from the source IP address to the destination IP address only when a connection has been established between the two. In early Internet protocols, requests and connections were 1:1. Now, once that connection is open, it can remain open and support hundreds or thousands of requests between that source and destination via <i>connection reuse</i> and <i>connection coalescing</i>. </p><p>Connection reuse, implemented by <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616?cf_history_state=%7B%22guid%22%3A%22C255D9FF78CD46CDA4F76812EA68C350%22%2C%22historyId%22%3A41%2C%22targetId%22%3A%223BBCDD89688CD49F2C3350ED8037BC6F%22%7D\"><u>HTTP/1.1</u></a>, allows for requests with the same source ip:port and destination IP:port to pass through the same connection to the origin. A “simple” website by modern standards can send hundreds of requests just to load initially; by streamlining these into a single origin connection, connection reuse reduces the latency derived from constantly opening and closing new connections between two endpoints. Still, any request from a different domain would need to create a new, unique connection to communicate with the origin. </p><p>As of <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540\"><u>HTTP/2</u></a>, connection coalescing can group requests from different domains into one connection if the requests have the same destination IP address and the server certificate is authoritative for both domains. Depending on the traffic patterns routing from the eyeball to an Aegis IP address, the volume of connection reuse &amp; coalescence can vary. One connection most likely facilitates the traffic of many requests, but each connection requires at least one request to open it in the first place. Therefore, the worst possible ratio between concurrent connections and concurrent requests is 1:1. </p><p>In practice, a 1:1 ratio between connections and requests almost <i>never</i> happens. Connection reuse and connection coalescence are very common but highly variable, due to sporadic traffic patterns. We size our Aegis IP address allocations accordingly, erring on the conservative side to minimize risk of capacity overload. With the proper number of dedicated egress IP addresses and optimal allocation to Cloudflare points of presence, we are able to lock down your origin with IPv4 addresses to block malicious layer 7 traffic and reduce overall load to your origin. </p><p>Connection reuse and coalescence pairs well with Aegis to reduce load on the origin’s side as well. Because a request can be reused if it comes from the same source IP:port and shares a destination IP:port, routing traffic from a reduced number of source IP addresses (Aegis addresses, in this case) to your origin facilitates a smaller number of total connections. Not only does this improve security by limiting open connection access, but also it reduces latency since fewer connections need to be opened. Maintaining fewer connections is also less resource intensive — more connections means more CPU and more memory handling the inbound requests. By reducing the number of connections to the origin through reuse and coalescence, HTTP/2 lowers the overall cost of operation by optimizing resource usage. </p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"recap-and-recommendations\">Recap and recommendations</h3>\n            <a href=\"#recap-and-recommendations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Cloudflare Aegis locks down your origin by restricting access via your origin’s layer 3 firewall. By routing traffic from Cloudflare’s network to your origin through dedicated egress IP addresses, you can ensure that requests coming from Cloudflare are legitimate customer traffic. With a simple flip-switch configuration — allow listing your Aegis IP addresses in your origin’s firewall — you can block excessive noise and bad actors from access. So, to help you take full advantage of Aegis, let’s recap:</p><ul><li><p>Concurrent connections can be, at worst, a 1:1 ratio to concurrent requests.</p></li><li><p>Cloudflare bases our IP address usage recommendations on 40,000 concurrent connections to minimize risk of capacity overload.</p></li><li><p>Each Aegis IP address supports an estimated 40,000 concurrent connections per origin IP address.</p></li></ul><p>Additionally, we’re excited to now support:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zones/subresources/settings/methods/edit/\"><u>Public Aegis API</u></a> </p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/aegis/setup/\"><u>BYOIP for Aegis</u></a> </p></li><li><p>Customer-facing Aegis observability (coming soon via gradual rollout)</p></li></ul><p>For customers leasing Cloudflare-owned Aegis IP addresses, the Aegis API will allow you to enable and disable Aegis on zones within your parent account (parent being the account which owns the IP lease). If you deploy your Aegis IP addresses across multiple accounts, you’ll still rely on Cloudflare’s account team to enable and disable Aegis on zones within those additional accounts.</p><p>For customers who leverage BYOIP for Aegis, the Aegis API will allow you to enable and disable Aegis on zones within your parent account <i>and</i> within any accounts to which you <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/byoip/concepts/prefix-delegations/#:~:text=BYOIP%20supports%20prefix%20delegations%2C%20which,service%20used%20with%20the%20prefix.\"><u>delegate prefix permissions</u></a>.

You will also be able to ingest these metrics to configure your own, customizable alerts based on certain port usage thresholds. Alongside the new configurability of Aegis, this visibility will better equip customers to manage their Aegis deployments themselves and alert <i>us</i> to any changes, rather than the other way around.</p><p>We also have a few adjacent recommendations to optimize your Aegis configuration. We generally encourage the following best practices for security hygiene for your origin and traffic as well.</p><ol><li><p><b>IPv6 Compatibility</b>: if your origin(s) support IPv6, you will experience even better resiliency, performance, and availability with your dedicated egress IP addresses at a lower overall cost.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/http2-vs-http1.1/\"><b><u>HTTP/2</u></b></a><b> or </b><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/\"><b><u>HTTP/3</u></b></a><b> adoption</b>: by supporting connection reuse and coalescence, you will reduce overall load to your origin and latency in the path of your request.</p></li><li><p><b>Multi-level origin protection</b>: while Aegis protects your origin at the application level, it pairs well with <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/access-aegis-cni/\"><u>Access and CNI</u></a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/\"><u>Authenticated Origin Pulls</u></a>, and/or other Cloudflare products to holistically protect, verify, and facilitate your traffic from edge to origin.</p></li></ol><p>If you or your organization want to enhance security and lock down your origin with dedicated egress IP addresses reach out to your account team to onboard today. </p>",
