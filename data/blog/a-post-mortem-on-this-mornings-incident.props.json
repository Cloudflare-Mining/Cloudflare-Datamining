In this case, our packets (and that of other Telia customers), were being dropped.</p><p>While Internet users usually take it for granted that they can reach any destination in the world from their homes and businesses, the reality is harsher than that. Our planet is big, and the Internet pipes are not always reliable. Fortunately, the Internet is mostly built on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol\">TCP protocol</a> which allows lost packets to be retransmitted. That is especially useful on lossy links. In most cases, you won’t notice these packets being lost and retransmitted, however, when the loss is too significant, as was the case this morning, your browser can’t do much.</p><p>Our systems caught the problem instantly and recorded it. Here is an animated map of the packet loss being detected during the event:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5t6Age3Kz1x46V9DhMR6VK/2ce8890115631935d749a75ca4a43d0a/telia-outage-6-20-2016--1-.gif\" alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"945\" height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>CloudFlare detects packet loss (denoted by thickness)</i></p><p>Because transit providers are usually reliable, they tend to fix their problems rather quickly. In this case, that did not happen and we had to take our ports down with Telia at 12:30 UTC. Because we are interconnected with most Tier 1 providers, we are able to shift traffic away from one problematic provider and let others, who are performing better, take care of transporting our packets.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"impact-on-our-customers\">Impact on our customers</h3>\n      <a href=\"#impact-on-our-customers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We saw a big increase in our 522s errors.

In today’s incident, we identified weaknesses in our communication: the scope of the incident was incorrectly identified in Europe only, and our response time was not adequate. We want to reassure you that we are taking all the steps to improve our communication, including implementation of automated detection and mitigation systems that can react much more quickly than any human operator. We already have such systems in place for our smaller data centers and are actively testing their accuracy and efficacy before turning them on for larger PoPs.</p><p>Taking down an important transit provider globally is not an easy decision, and many cautious steps are to be taken before doing it. The Internet and its associated protocols are a community based on mutual trust. Any weak link in the chain will cause the entire chain to fail and requires collaboration and cooperation from all parties to make it successful.</p><p>We know how important it is to communicate on our status page.

This is achieved through a combination of greater interconnection, automated mitigation, and increased failover capacity.</p><p>We fill our cache from the public Internet using multiple transit providers (such as Telia), and deliver traffic to local eyeball networks using transit providers and multiple peering relationships. To the extent possible, we maintain buffer capacity with our providers to allow them to bear the impact of potential failures on multiple other networks. Spreading out traffic across providers allows for diversity and reduces the impact of potential outages from our upstream providers. Even so, today’s incident impacted a significant fraction of traffic that relied on the Telia backbone.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/46TEFOaWNqhcniJqK8W80J/83a0cd7620a024c0bc3aa9151057b4df/Screenshot-2016-06-20-22-28-05.png\" alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"199\" height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>_Traffic switching from one provider to the other after we reroute_</p><p>Where possible, we try to failover traffic to a redundant provider or data center while keeping traffic within the same country.</p><p>BGP is the protocol used to route packets between autonomous networks on the Internet.

Because this system is currently activated only for our most remote and smallest locations, it didn&#39;t trigger in this morning’s incident.
