From independent media and human rights groups to community activists, Project Galileo supports those often targeted for their essential work in human rights, civil society, and democracy building.</p><p>A lot has changed since we marked the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/pt-br/celebrating-10-years-of-project-galileo/\"><u>10th anniversary</u></a> of Project Galileo. Yet, our commitment remains the same: help ensure that organizations doing critical work in human rights have access to the tools they need to stay online.  We believe that organizations, no matter where they are in the world, deserve reliable, accessible protection to continue their important work without disruption.</p><p>For our 11th anniversary, we&#39;re excited to share several updates including:</p><ul><li><p>An interactive <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/project-galileo-11th-anniv\"><u>Cloudflare Radar report</u></a> providing insights into the cyber threats faced by at-risk public interest organizations protected under the project. </p></li><li><p>An expanded commitment to digital rights in the Asia-Pacific region with two new Project Galileo partners.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/project-galileo-case-studies/\"><u>New stories </u></a>from organizations protected by Project Galileo working on the frontlines of civil society, human rights, and journalism from around the world.</p></li></ul>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3xVNGtdTOw6NXqSfzU7Up1/8a2cbe643108fa97a4d14af477a6cb80/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1430\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"tracking-and-reporting-on-cyberattacks-with-the-project-galileo-11th-anniversary-radar-report\">Tracking and reporting on cyberattacks with the Project Galileo 11th anniversary Radar report </h2>\n            <a href=\"#tracking-and-reporting-on-cyberattacks-with-the-project-galileo-11th-anniversary-radar-report\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>To mark Project Galileo’s 11th anniversary, we’ve published a <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/project-galileo-11th-anniv\"><u>new Radar report</u></a> that shares data on cyberattacks targeting organizations protected by the program. It provides insights into the types of threats these groups face, with the goal of better supporting researchers, civil society, and vulnerable groups by promoting the best cybersecurity practices. Key insights include:</p><ul><li><p>Our data indicates a growing trend in DDoS attacks against these organizations, becoming more common than attempts to exploit traditional web application vulnerabilities.</p></li><li><p>Between May 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, Cloudflare blocked 108.9 billion cyber threats against organizations protected under Project Galileo. This is an average of nearly 325.2 million cyber attacks per day over the 11-month period, and a 241% increase from our 2024 Radar report. </p></li><li><p>Journalists and news organizations experienced the highest volume of attacks, with over 97 billion requests blocked as potential threats across 315 different organizations. The peak attack traffic was recorded on September 28, 2024. Ranked second was the Human Rights/Civil Society Organizations category, which saw 8.9 billion requests blocked, with peak attack activity occurring on October 8, 2024.</p></li><li><p>Cloudflare onboarded the <a href=\"https://investigatebel.org/en\"><u>Belarusian Investigative Center</u></a>, an independent journalism organization, on September 27, 2024, while it was already under attack. A major application-layer DDoS attack followed on September 28, generating over 28 billion requests in a single day. </p></li><li><p>Many of the targets were investigative journalism outlets operating in regions under government pressure (such as Russia and Belarus), as well as NGOs focused on combating racism and extremism, and defending workers’ rights.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://t4p.co/\"><u>Tech4Peace</u></a>, a human rights organization focused on digital rights, was targeted by a 12-day attack beginning March 10, 2025, that delivered over 2.7 billion requests. The attack saw prolonged, lower-intensity attacks and short, high-intensity bursts. This deliberate variation in tactics reveals a coordinated approach, showing how attackers adapted their methods throughout the attack.</p></li></ul><p>The full Radar report includes additional information on public interest organizations, human and civil rights groups, environmental organizations, and those involved in disaster and humanitarian relief. The dashboard also serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and advocates working to protect public interest organizations worldwide.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"global-partners-are-the-key-to-project-galileos-continued-growth\">Global partners are the key to Project Galileo&#39;s continued growth</h2>\n            <a href=\"#global-partners-are-the-key-to-project-galileos-continued-growth\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Partnerships are core to Project Galileo success.

Among other things, the camp focused on building practical skills in digital safety and website resilience against online threats. Cloudflare presented on common attack vectors targeting nonprofits and human rights groups, such as DDoS attacks, phishing, and website defacement, and shared how Project Galileo helps organizations mitigate these risks. We also discussed how to better promote digital security tools to vulnerable groups.
