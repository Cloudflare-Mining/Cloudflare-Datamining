	<p>Open source is the core fabric of the web, and the open source tools that power the modern web depend on the stability and support of the community.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>To ensure two major open source projects have the resources they need, we are proud to announce our financial sponsorship to two cornerstone frameworks in the modern web ecosystem: <b>Astro</b> and <b>TanStack</b>.</p>
	<p>Critically, we think it’s important we don’t do this alone — for the open web to continue to thrive, we must bet on and support technologies and frameworks that are open and accessible to all, and not beholden to any one company.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Which is why we are also excited to announce that for these sponsorships we are joining forces with our peers at <b>Netlify to sponsor TanStack</b> and <b>Webflow to sponsor Astro</b>.</p>

	<p>Our decision to support Astro and TanStack was deliberate. These two projects represent distinct but complementary visions for the future of web development. One is redefining the architecture for high-performance, content-driven websites, while the other provides a full-stack toolkit for building the most ambitious web applications.</p>

	<p>When it comes to endorsing a technology, we believe actions speak louder than words.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>That’s why our support for Astro isn't just financial—it's foundational. We run our developer documentation site, developers.cloudflare.com, entirely on Astro. This isn't a small side project —&nbsp;it's a critical resource visited by hundreds of thousands of developers every day, with dozens of contributors constantly keeping it updated. For a site like this, performance isn't a feature; it's a requirement.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>We chose Astro because its core principles mirror our own. Its "zero JS by default" architecture delivers the raw performance and stellar SEO that a content-heavy site demands, ensuring our docs are fast and discoverable. Just as importantly, Astro is framework-agnostic, letting teams use components from React, Vue, or Svelte without vendor lock-in.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Astro makes it easy for our global team to keep content up-to-date and, most importantly, keep our docs blazing fast. Our sponsorship is a direct result of the immense value we've experienced firsthand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<p>If Astro provides the ideal foundation for content-heavy sites, TanStack provides the ideal engine for complex web applications. TanStack is not a single framework but a suite of powerful, headless, and type-safe libraries that solve the hardest problems in modern application development.</p>
	<p>Libraries like TanStack Query have become the de facto industry standard for managing asynchronous server state, elegantly solving complex challenges like caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates that once required thousands of lines of fragile, bespoke code. Similarly, TanStack Router brings full type-safety to routing, eliminating an entire class of common bugs, while TanStack Table and TanStack Form provide the robust, headless primitives needed to build sophisticated, data-intensive user interfaces.</p>
	<p>And today, TanStack announced its official release of the release candidate for TanStack Start 1.0, taking a big stride towards production-readiness.</p>
	<p><b>TanStack Start</b> is a new full-stack framework that composes these powerful libraries into a cohesive, enterprise-grade development experience. With features like full-document Server-Side Rendering (SSR), streaming, and a "deploy anywhere" architecture, TanStack Start is designed for the modern, serverless edge. It provides the power and type-safety needed for ambitious applications and is a perfect match for deployment environments like Cloudflare Workers.</p>

	<p>It is not lost on us that this coalition includes companies that compete in the market. We believe this is a feature, not a bug. It demonstrates a shared understanding that we are all building on the same open-source foundations. A healthy, innovative, and sustainable open-source ecosystem is the rising tide that lifts all of our boats.</p>
	<p>This joint sponsorship model means Astro and TanStack are more resilient. For you, that means you can build on them with confidence, knowing they aren't dependent on a single company's shifting priorities.</p>
