And with a war in Europe (<a href=\"/tag/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a>) still going on, cyberwar also doesn’t show signs of stopping in a time when there never were so many people online, 4.95 billion in early 2022, 62.5% of the world’s total population (<a href=\"https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2022-global-overview-report\">estimates</a> say it grew around 4% during 2021 and <a href=\"https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2021-global-overview-report\">7.3%</a> in 2020).</p><p>Throughout the year we, at Cloudflare, have been making new announcements of products, solutions and initiatives that highlight the way we have been <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/how-to-prevent-ddos-attacks/\">preventing</a>, mitigating and constantly learning, over the years, with several thousands of small and big cyberattacks.

We saw an attack with very similar characteristics also targeting Cloudflare’s employees. <a href=\"/2022-07-sms-phishing-attacks/\">Here</a>, we do a rundown on how we were able to thwart the attack that could have breached most organizations, by using our Cloudflare One products, and physical security keys. And how others can do the same. No Cloudflare systems were compromised.</p><p>Our <a href=\"/introducing-cloudforce-one-threat-operations-and-threat-research/\">Cloudforce One</a> threat intelligence team dissected the attack and assisted in tracking down the attacker.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/br7n6YlxPChn033jKhwTR/321d5120fe7dbd0d8084d4c2f31b461e/image3-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1801\" height=\"1013\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Introducing browser isolation for email links to stop modern phishing threats (</b><a href=\"/email-link-isolation/\"><b>✍️</b></a><b>)</b>Why do humans <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7005690/\">still click</a> on malicious links? It seems that it’s easier to do it than most people think (“human error is human”). <a href=\"/email-link-isolation/\">Here</a> we explain how an organization nowadays can&#39;t truly have a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust security posture</a> without securing email; an application that end users implicitly trust and threat actors take advantage of that inherent trust.</p><p>As part of our journey to integrate Area 1 into our broader Zero Trust suite, Cloudflare Gateway customers can enable <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-browser-isolation/\">Remote Browser Isolation</a> for email links. With that, we now give unmatched level of protection from modern multi-channel email-based attacks. While we’re at it, you can also learn <a href=\"/replace-your-email-gateway-with-area-1/\">how to replace your email gateway with Cloudflare Area 1</a>.</p><p>About account takeovers, we explained back in March 2021 <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/account-takeover-prevention/\">how we prevent account takeovers</a> on our own applications (on the phishing side we were already using, as a customer, at the time, Area 1).</p><p>Also from last year, <a href=\"/research-directions-in-password-security/\">here’s</a> our research in <b>password security</b> (and the problem of password reuse) — it gets technical. There’s a new password related protocol called OPAQUE (<a href=\"https://opaque-full.research.cloudflare.com/\">we added a new demo about it on January 2022</a>) that could help better store secrets that our research team is excited about.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"4-malware-ransomware-other-risks\">4.

In this <a href=\"/how-cloudflare-security-does-zero-trust/\">blog post</a> written for our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one-week/\">Cloudflare One week</a>, we explain how that ecosystem, in this case inside our Zero Trust services, can give protection from malware, ransomware, phishing, command &amp; control, shadow IT, and other Internet risks over all ports and protocols.</p><p>Since 2020, we launched <a href=\"/announcing-antivirus-in-cloudflare-gateway/\">Cloudflare Gateway</a> focused on malware detection and prevention directly from the Cloudflare edge. Recently, we also include our new <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/casb/\">CASB</a> product (to secure workplace tools, personalize access, secure sensitive data).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4JXI6TtKH5z3SNlVUOM4P4/367b94a7e9e0f518374822ff2f8e7d97/image1-14.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1815\" height=\"738\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Anatomy of a Targeted Ransomware Attack (</b><a href=\"/targeted-ransomware-attack/\"><b>✍️</b></a><b>)</b>What a ransomware attack looks like for the victim:</p><blockquote><p><i>“Imagine your most critical systems suddenly stop operating. And then someone demands a ransom to get your systems working again. Or someone launches a DDoS against you and demands a ransom to make it stop. That’s the world of ransomware and ransom DDoS.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Ransomware attacks continue <a href=\"https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/ransomware-attack-trends-2020\">to be on the rise</a> and there’s no sign of them slowing down in the near future. That was true more than a year ago, when this <a href=\"/targeted-ransomware-attack/\">blog post</a> was written and is still <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/ransomware-growing-cyber-risk-for-us-corporates-financials-govt-27-04-2022\">ongoing</a>, up 105% YoY according to a Senate Committee March 2022 report. And the nature of ransomware attacks is changing. Here, we highlight how <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ransom-ddos-attack/\">Ransom DDoS (RDDoS)</a> attacks work, how Cloudflare onboarded and <a href=\"/ransom-ddos-attacks-target-a-fortune-global-500-company/\">protected</a> a Fortune 500 customer from a targeted one, and how that <a href=\"/announcing-antivirus-in-cloudflare-gateway/\">Gateway with antivirus</a> we mentioned before helps with just that.</p><p>We also show that with ransomware as a service (<a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/\">RaaS</a>) models, it’s even easier for inexperienced threat actors to get their hands on them today (“RaaS is essentially a franchise that allows criminals to rent ransomware from malware authors”). We also include some general recommendations to help you and your organization stay secure. Don’t want to click the link? Here they are:</p><ul><li><p>Use 2FA everywhere, especially on your remote access entry points. This is where Cloudflare Access really helps.</p></li><li><p>Maintain multiple redundant backups of critical systems and data, both onsite and offsite</p></li><li><p>Monitor and block malicious domains using Cloudflare Gateway + AV</p></li><li><p>Sandbox web browsing activity using Cloudflare RBI to isolate threats at the browser</p></li></ul>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2A9QpWsLw6VCvL1l757YgV/9f4d71288d5920aeab4fe0b5f27c4091/image2-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1801\" height=\"1013\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Investigating threats using the Cloudflare Security Center (</b><a href=\"/security-center-investigate/\"><b>✍️</b></a><b>)</b><a href=\"/security-center-investigate/\">Here</a>, first we announce our new threat investigations portal, <i>Investigate</i>, right in the Cloudflare Security Center, that allows all customers to query directly our intelligence to streamline security workflows and tighten feedback loops.</p><p>That’s only possible because we have a global and in-depth view, given that we <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/\">protect millions of Internet properties from attacks</a> (the free plans help us to have that insight). And the data we glean from these attacks trains our machine learning models and improves the efficacy of our network and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/\">application security products</a>.</p><p><b>Steps we&#39;ve taken around Cloudflare&#39;s services in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia (</b><a href=\"/steps-taken-around-cloudflares-services-in-ukraine-belarus-and-russia/\"><b>✍️</b></a><b>)</b>There’s an emergence of the known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiper_(malware)\">wiper</a> malware attacks (intended to erase the computer it infects) and in this <a href=\"/steps-taken-around-cloudflares-services-in-ukraine-belarus-and-russia/\">blog post</a>, among other things, we explain how when a wiper malware was identified in Ukraine (it took offline government agencies and a major bank), we successfully adapted our Zero Trust products to make sure our customers were protected. Those protections include many Ukrainian organizations, under our <a href=\"/in-ukraine-and-beyond-what-it-takes-to-keep-vulnerable-groups-online/\">Project Galileo</a> that is having a busy year, and they were automatically put available to all our customers. More recently, the satellite provider Viasat was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/russia-viasat-cyberattack/\">affected</a>.</p><p><b>Zaraz use Workers to make third-party tools secure and fast (</b><a href=\"/zaraz-use-workers-to-make-third-party-tools-secure-and-fast/\"><b>✍️</b></a><b>)</b>Cloudflare announced it acquired <a href=\"/cloudflare-acquires-zaraz-to-enable-cloud-loading-of-third-party-tools/\">Zaraz</a> in December 2021 to help us enable cloud loading of third-party tools. Seems unrelated to attacks? Think again (this takes us back to the secure ecosystem I already mentioned). Among other things, <a href=\"/zaraz-use-workers-to-make-third-party-tools-secure-and-fast/\"><b>here</b></a> you can learn how Zaraz can make your website more secure (and faster) by offloading third-party scripts.</p><p>That allows to avoid problems and attacks. Which? From code tampering to lose control over the data sent to third-parties. My colleague <a href=\"/author/yoav/\">Yo&#39;av Moshe</a> elaborates on what this solution prevents: “the third-party script can intentionally or unintentionally (due to being hacked) collect information it shouldn&#39;t collect, like credit card numbers, Personal Identifiers Information (PIIs), etc.”. You should definitely avoid those.</p><p><b>Introducing Cloudforce One: our new threat operations and research team (</b><a href=\"/introducing-cloudforce-one-threat-operations-and-threat-research/\"><b>✍️</b></a><b>)</b><a href=\"/introducing-cloudforce-one-threat-operations-and-threat-research/\">Meet</a> our new threat operations and research team: <b>Cloudforce One</b>.
