They can fail in many spectacular ways. Not getting it done being one of them, very popular. Failing to live up to high expectations (the ones that also caused the rewrite), is also well known to shatter the dreams of every project manager.

Years of dealing with the intricate details of such an installation, have lead to a pretty mature setup.</p><p>Fortunately, there is no pressure from the underlying technology to finish the transition in a hurry. Time, about 1+ years, is actually on our side. The team is able to contribute changes step by step. This is when we are incorporating some of the great ideas out there: Edge Side Includes.</p><p>I first heard about it, in some office kitchen talks, about how Amazon is apparently never failing, because so many of their services are backed up by fallbacks. For example, if some part of the page does not render in time, this part is able to fallback to other fitting content gracefully.</p><p>I could never verify these claims, but the idea sure stuck to me. When requiring high availability, this idea is very appealing. During the transition period, the idea is to rewrite parts of the website, step by step, and steadily grow the new frontend while everything is running.</p><p>We need two particular features from the ESI toolbox:</p><ul><li><p>Includes: Our new frontend, should be able to render components of the current page. We want to include them, and overwrite parts of the page with the new frontend.</p></li><li><p>Fallbacks: Wordpress will remain running during the live transition period. Any fragment, that fails, can still be taken from Wordpress.</p></li></ul>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"origin-html-document\">Origin HTML document</h3>\n            <a href=\"#origin-html-document\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Lets look at a simplified example.
