Imagine that you’re maintaining a corporate network, and you get the dreaded IT ticket. An executive is having a performance issue with an application, and they want you to look into it. The ticket doesn’t have a lot of details. It simply says: “Our internal documentation is taking forever to load. PLS FIX NOW”.</p><p>In the early days of IT, a corporate network was built on-premises. It provided network connectivity between employees that worked in person and a variety of corporate applications that were hosted locally.</p><p>The shift to cloud environments, the rise of SaaS applications, and a “work from anywhere” model has made IT environments significantly more complex in the past few years. Today, it’s hard to know if a performance issue is the result of:</p><ul><li><p>An employee’s device</p></li><li><p>Their home or corporate wifi</p></li><li><p>The corporate network</p></li><li><p>A cloud network hosting a SaaS app</p></li><li><p>An intermediary ISP</p></li></ul><p>A performance ticket submitted by an employee might even be a combination of multiple performance issues all wrapped together into one nasty problem.</p><p>Cloudflare built <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/\"><u>Cloudflare One</u></a>, our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/\">Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) </a>platform, to protect enterprise applications, users, devices, and networks. In particular, this platform relies on two capabilities to simplify troubleshooting performance issues:</p><ul><li><p>Cloudflare’s Zero Trust client, also known as <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/\"><u>WARP</u></a>, forwards and encrypts traffic from devices to Cloudflare edge.</p></li><li><p>Digital Experience Monitoring (<a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/\"><u>DEX</u></a>) works alongside WARP to monitor device, network, and application performance.</p></li></ul><p>We’re excited to announce two new AI-powered tools that will make it easier to troubleshoot WARP client connectivity and performance issues.  We’re releasing a new WARP diagnostic analyzer in the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust</a> dashboard and a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp/\"><u>MCP (Model Context Protocol)</u></a> server for DEX.

For desktop clients, the most common issues can be investigated with the information captured in logs called <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/warp-overview-course/series/warp-basics-2/\"><u>WARP diagnostic</u></a>. Each WARP diagnostic log contains an extensive amount of information spanning days of captured events occurring on the client. It takes expertise to manually go through all of this information and understand the full picture of what is occurring on a client that is having issues. In the past, we’ve advised customers having issues to send their WARP diagnostic log straight to us so that our trained support experts can do a root cause analysis for them. While this is effective, we want to give our customers the tools to take control of deciphering common troubleshooting issues for even quicker resolution. </p><p>Enter the WARP diagnostic analyzer, a new AI available for free in the Cloudflare One dashboard as of today! This AI demystifies information in the WARP diagnostic log so you can better understand events impacting the performance of your clients and network connectivity. Now, when you run a <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/remote-captures/\"><u>remote capture for WARP diagnostics</u></a> in the Cloudflare One dashboard, you can generate an <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/troubleshooting/warp-logs/#view-warp-diagnostics-summary-beta\"><u>AI analysis of the WARP diagnostic file</u></a>. Simply go to your organization’s Zero Trust dashboard and select DEX &gt; Remote Captures from the side navigation bar.

Let’s dive into how this will save our customers time and money.</p><p>Cloudflare One customers use Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX) to monitor devices across their employee network and troubleshoot any connectivity or performance issues. Like many products at Cloudflare, every data point generated by DEX is available to customers via Cloudflare’s API or log ingestion. DEX API and log data is valuable because it enables Enterprises to create custom analytics for their devices’ connectivity and performance in a SIEM (<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-siem/\"><u>Security Information and Event Management</u></a>). Building new data pipelines and various dashboards can take a lot of time and can be expensive. Some of Cloudflare One customers aren’t able to dedicate the engineering time to build custom analytics: whether it’s due to budget, resource constraints, time constraints, or other factors.</p><p>Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an AI standardization that allows AI to connect to other applications. In this instance, using MCP together with DEX gives users a custom analytics experience — without all the work of integrating log data into a SIEM. Network security practitioners can type out a question (like “Show me the performance data for alice@acme.com’s device in a few graphs”), and an MCP server will answer that question with a customized graph on Alice’s device data from the DEX API.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"troubleshooting-dns-query-performance-with-the-dex-mcp-server\">Troubleshooting DNS query performance with the DEX MCP server</h2>\n      <a href=\"#troubleshooting-dns-query-performance-with-the-dex-mcp-server\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Any IT admin, security engineer, or network engineer can ask the MCP server a question like: “I received an IT ticket from bob@acme.com who is an enterprise employee. He is complaining about the performance of his device. Can you investigate this for me?”.</p><p>After you submit this question, the DEX MCP server will start by reviewing the device’s overall health.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">Overall Device Health:\n✅ Connection Status: Consistently connected for the past 24 hours with 100% availability\n✅ WARP Mode: Running in optimal &quot;warp+doh&quot; (WARP + DNS over HTTPS) mode\n✅ Client Version: Up-to-date with version 2025.1.7.2</pre></code>\n            <p>So far, the device’s health looks great. Next, the DEX MCP server will begin analyzing the results of the performance tests that are configured on Bob’s device.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">📊 Performance Metrics Analysis\n\nHTTP Response Times:\nGoogle.com test: Average 247ms (Range: 81-649ms)\n  • Shows significant improvement throughout the day: Started at ~317ms, dropped to ~211ms by evening\nWiki.internal.acme.com: Average 1,374ms (Range: 877-2,431ms)\n  • This is notably high and could be the source of performance complaints\n  • DNS resolution particularly slow: Average 616ms with spikes up to 1,600ms</pre></code>\n            <p>Now we’re making progress in our troubleshooting effort. The DEX MCP server identified that the HTTP GET test for wiki.internal.acme.com has a high average resource fetch time when compared to other websites (like google.com). In particular, high resource fetch time is the result of slow DNS resolution. Now, the DEX MCP server will summarize its findings.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">🚨 Performance Issues Identified\nExtremely Slow DNS Resolution:\n  • Average DNS response time of 616ms is significantly high\n  • Normal DNS should be &lt;50ms for good performance\nHigh Resource Fetch Times on wiki.internal.acme.com:\n   • 1.3+ second response times indicate potential application-level issues\n   • Could be related to DNS performance or server-side delays\nHTTP Status Code Issues:\n        • wiki.internal.acme.com is showing consistent HTTP 400 errors\n        • This suggests potential configuration or routing issues</pre></code>\n            <p>Now, we’ve successfully identified that Bob’s slow wiki performance is the result of a high average DNS response time. Slow DNS resolution increases the average resource fetch time, and also generates HTTP 400 errors for Enterprise employees that are attempting to access wiki.internal.acme.com. Notably, it’s likely that if the wiki is seeing slow DNS response times, other internal applications are experiencing performance issues as well.</p><p>We can ask the DEX MCP server to suggest potential solutions that would fix this wider DNS performance issue.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">🔧 DNS Optimization Strategies\n\nCheck WARP DNS configuration and settings\n  • Since the device is using WARP+DoH mode, you can optimize the DNS settings\nImplement or improve local DNS caching\n  • Implement or improve local DNS caching to reduce repeated lookups\nNetwork stack tuning\n  • Optimize TCP / UDP settings for DNS</pre></code>\n            \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"try-out-the-dex-mcp-server-today\">Try out the DEX MCP server today</h2>\n      <a href=\"#try-out-the-dex-mcp-server-today\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"fast-and-easy-option-for-testing-an-mcp-server\">Fast and easy option for testing an MCP server</h3>\n      <a href=\"#fast-and-easy-option-for-testing-an-mcp-server\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Any Cloudflare One customer with a Free, PayGo, or ENT plan can start using the DEX MCP server in less than one minute.

For example, you may need to say, “Set my production account as the active  account”, and then give the separate command, “Fetch the DEX test results for the user bob@acme.com over the past 24 hours”.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"better-experience-for-mcp-servers-that-requires-additional-steps\">Better experience for MCP servers that requires additional steps</h3>\n      <a href=\"#better-experience-for-mcp-servers-that-requires-additional-steps\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Customers will get a more flexible prompt experience by configuring the DEX MCP server with their preferred AI assistant (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) that has MCP server support.
