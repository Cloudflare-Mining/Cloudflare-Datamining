It started, on a day like today, as a <a href=\"/introducing-cloudflare-workers/\">Birthday Week</a> announcement. It may not have had all the bells and whistles that exist today, but if you got to try Workers when it launched, it conjured this feeling: “this is different, and it’s going to change things”. All of a sudden, going from nothing to a fully scalable, global application took <i>seconds</i>, not hours, days, weeks or even months. It was the beginning of a different way to build applications.</p><p>If you’ve played with generative AI over the past few months, you may have had a similar feeling. Surveying a few friends and colleagues, our “aha” moments were all a bit different, but the overarching sentiment across the industry at this moment is unanimous — this is different, and it’s going to change things.</p><p>Today, we’re excited to make a series of announcements that we believe will make a similar impact as Workers did in the future of computing. Without burying the lede any further, here they are:</p><ul><li><p><b>Workers AI</b> (formerly known as Constellation), <b>running on NVIDIA GPUs on Cloudflare’s global network</b>, bringing the serverless model to AI — pay only for what you use, spend less time on infrastructure, and more on your application.</p></li><li><p><b>Vectorize, our vector Database</b>, making it easy, fast and affordable to index and store vectors to support use cases that require access not just to running models, but customized data too.</p></li><li><p><b>AI Gateway</b>, giving organizations the tools to <b>cache, rate limit and observe</b> their AI deployments regardless of where they’re running.</p></li></ul><p>But that’s not all.</p><p>Doing big things is a team sport, and we don’t want to do it alone. Like in so much of what we do, we stand on the shoulders of giants. We’re thrilled to partner with some of the biggest players in the space: <b>NVIDIA, Microsoft, Hugging Face, Databricks, and Meta</b>.</p><p>Our announcements today mark just the beginning of Cloudflare’s journey into the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/\">AI space</a>, like Workers did six years ago. While we encourage you to dive into each of our announcements (you won’t be disappointed!), we also wanted to take the chance to step back and provide you with a bit of our broader vision for AI, and how these announcements fit into it.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"inference-the-future-of-ai-workloads\">Inference: The future of AI workloads</h3>\n      <a href=\"#inference-the-future-of-ai-workloads\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>There are two main processes involved in AI: training and inference.</p><p>Training a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-generative-ai/\">generative AI model</a> is a long-running (sometimes months-long) compute intensive process, which results in a model. Training workloads are therefore best suited for running in traditional centralized cloud locations. Given the recent challenges in being able to obtain long-running access to GPUs, resulting in companies going multi-cloud, we’ve talked about the ways in which <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/\">R2</a> can provide an essential service that eliminates <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-are-data-egress-fees/\">egress fees</a> for the training data to be accessed from any compute cloud. But that’s not what we’re here to talk about today.</p><p>While training requires many resources upfront, the much more ubiquitous AI-related compute task is inference. If you’ve recently asked ChatGPT a question, generated an image, translated some text, then you’ve performed an inference task. Since inference is required upon every single invocation (rather than just once), we expect that inference will become the dominant AI-related workload.</p><p>If training is best suited for a centralized cloud, then what is the best place for inference?</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-network-just-right-for-inference\">The network — “just right” for inference</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-network-just-right-for-inference\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The defining characteristic of inference is that there’s usually a user waiting on the other end of it. That is, it’s a latency sensitive task.</p><p>The best place, you might think, for a latency sensitive task is on the device. And it might be in some cases, but there are a few problems. First, hardware on devices is not nearly as powerful. Battery life.</p><p>On the other hand, you have centralized cloud compute. Unlike devices, the hardware running in centralized cloud locations has nothing if not horsepower. The problem, of course, is that it’s hundreds of milliseconds away from the user. And sometimes, they’re even across borders, which presents its own set of challenges.</p><p>So devices are not yet powerful enough, and centralized cloud is too far away. This makes the network the goldilocks of inference. Not too far, with sufficient compute power — just right.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-first-inference-cloud-running-on-region-earth\">The first inference cloud, running on Region Earth</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-first-inference-cloud-running-on-region-earth\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>One lesson we learned building our developer platform is that running applications at network scale not only helps optimize performance and scale (though obviously that’s a nice benefit!), but even more importantly, creates the right level of abstraction for developers to move fast.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"workers-ai-for-serverless-inference\">Workers AI for serverless inference</h4>\n      <a href=\"#workers-ai-for-serverless-inference\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Kicking things off with our announcement of <a href=\"/workers-ai/\">Workers AI</a>, we’re bringing the first truly serverless GPU cloud, to its perfect match — Region Earth.
