Preparing for elections is a giant task, and states and localities have their work cut out for them with corralling poll workers, setting up polling places, and managing the physical security of ballots and voting machines.</p><p>We at Cloudflare are proud to be able to play a role in helping safeguard the integrity of the electoral process. Through our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/impact/\">Impact</a> programs, we provide cyber security products to help protect access to authoritative voting information and the security of sensitive voter data.</p><p>We have reported on our work in the election space with the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/\">Athenian Project</a>, dedicated to protecting state and local governments that run elections; <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/campaigns/usa/\">Cloudflare for Campaigns</a>, a project with a suite of Cloudflare products to secure political campaigns’ and state parties’ websites and internal teams; and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/\">Project Galileo</a>, in which we have helped <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/voteamerica/\">voting rights organizations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/decision-desk-hq/\">election results sites</a> stay online during traffic spikes.</p><p><a href=\"/2020-us-election-cybersecurity-analysis/\">Since our reporting in 2020</a>, we have expanded our <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JCDC_Fact_Sheet.pdf\">relationships with</a> <a href=\"/helping-keep-governments-safe-and-secure/\">government agencies</a> and worked with project participants across the United States in a range of election roles to support free and fair elections.

Killnet, a pro-Russia hacking group, targeted US state websites<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/colorado-state-websites-struggle-russian-hackers-vow-attack-rcna51012\">, successfully</a> taking the public-facing websites of a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/colorado-state-websites-struggle-russian-hackers-vow-attack-rcna51012\">number of states</a> temporarily offline. Hacking groups will target public-facing government websites to promote mistrust in the democratic process.</p><p>Voting authorities face challenges unrelated to malicious activity, too. Without the proper tools in place, traffic spikes during election season can <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/preventing-downtime/\">impede voters’ ability to access information</a> about polling places, registration, and results. During the 2020 US election, we saw 4x traffic spikes to government elections sites.</p><p>On the political organizing side, political campaigns and state parties increasingly rely on the Internet and their web presence to issue policy stances, raise donations, and organize their campaign operations. In October 2022, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/chinese-hackers-are-scanning-state-political-party-headquarters-fbi-says/\">FBI notified</a> Republican and Democratic state parties that Chinese hackers were scanning party websites for vulnerabilities.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"so-what-happened-during-the-2022-us-midterm-elections\">So, what happened during the 2022 US midterm elections?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#so-what-happened-during-the-2022-us-midterm-elections\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7B7DkjldQpP49OglkYkpIH/9df9ba91342c21cc278d3d01722917cd/image1-14.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1201\" height=\"801\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As we prepared for the midterms, we had a team of engineers ready to assist state and local governments, campaigns, political parties, and voting rights organizations looking for help to protect their websites from cyber attacks. A majority of the threats that we saw and directly assisted on were before the election, especially in the wake of many advisories from federal agencies on Killnet’s targeting of US government sites.</p><p>During this time, we worked with CISA’s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) to provide security briefings to state and local election officials and to make sure our free Enterprise services for state and local governments under the Athenian Project were part of <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-toolkit-protect-elections\">JCDC’s Cybersecurity Toolkit to Protect Elections</a>. We provided additional support in terms of webinars, security recommendations, and best practices to better prepare these groups for the midterms.</p><p>A week before the election, we worked with partners such as <a href=\"https://defendcampaigns.org/\">Defending Digital Campaigns</a> to onboard many political campaigns and state parties to Cloudflare for Campaigns after seeing a number of campaigns come <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/under-attack/\">under DDoS attack</a>.
