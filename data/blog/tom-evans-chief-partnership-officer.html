	<p>In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the decision to join a company is not just about making a career move. Instead, it's about finding a mission, a community, and a platform to make a meaningful impact. Cloudflare’s remarkable technology and incredibly driven teams are two reasons why I’m excited to join the team.</p>
	<p>Joining Cloudflare as the Chief Partner Officer is my commitment to driving innovation and impact across the Internet through our channel partnerships. In each conversation throughout the interview process, I found myself getting more and more excited about the opportunity. Several former trusted colleagues who have recently joined Cloudflare repeatedly told me how amazing the people and company culture are. A positive culture driven by people that are passionate about their work is key. We work too hard not to have fun while doing it.</p>
	<p>When it comes to partnerships, I see the immense value that partners can provide. My philosophy revolves around fostering collaborative, value-driven partnerships. It is about building ecosystems where we jointly navigate challenges, innovate together, and collectively thrive in a rapidly evolving global marketplace where the success of our channel partners directly influences our collective achievements. It also involves investing in their growth through tailored programs and providing strategic guidance and ongoing support. In doing so, we strengthen our most competitive advantage: our partners.</p>
	<p>Partners are integral to our success in extending critical solutions to our customers, to fully connect and secure businesses, and in turn, the Internet at large. There are unique aspects to Cloudflare that I believe will be especially appealing as we grow this part of our business.</p>

	<p>Working with channel partners over the years, fostering meaningful relationships, and gaining insights into unique perspectives is what I find the most enjoyment in. The constant exchange of ideas and learning within these relationships acts as a catalyst for innovation and continuous improvement.</p>
	<p>Since my early days as a sales account manager, I experienced the immense value partners provide first-hand, and leaned into this. As an integral part of my success, I found myself crafting comprehensive sales strategies that aligned our partners' capabilities with my business objectives. I focused on developing value-driven partnerships that transcend a purely transactional mindset, which led me to a role managing partners and eventually leading channel sales and distribution teams.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare embodies everything I personally look for in a company. I am eager to be part of the talented team here and partner with organizations around the world to drive meaningful change by contributing to the mission of helping build a better Internet for all. The future is bright, and I couldn’t be more thrilled to be a part of it.</p>
