However, this is a major security threat because anyone on the VPN can access the application, including unauthorized users or attackers.</p><p>We built Cloudflare Access to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/vpn-replacement/\">replace VPNs</a> and provide the option to enforce <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust policies</a> in hosted applications. Access allows you to verify a user&#39;s identity before they even reach the application. By acting as a proxy in front of your application&#39;s hostname (e.g. app.example.com), Cloudflare enables strong verification techniques such as identity, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/\">device posture</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/mfa-requirements/#:~:text=When%20users%20authenticate%20with%20their%20identity%20provider%2C%20the,%28MFA%29%20method%20presented%20by%20the%20user%20to%20login.\">hardkey MFA</a>, and more.

For example, Cloudflare Tunnel implicitly assumes that the network path between Cloudflare and your application is using the public Internet. Cloudflare Tunnel encrypts your traffic over the public Internet and ensures that your connection to Cloudflare is secure. But the public Internet is still a concern for a lot of people, who don’t want to harden their service to the public Internet at all.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/22LDH8UFB8wdr2QrefGTtv/9a57d848ddb57eb42f75c4302c7de3e1/pasted-image-0-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1530\" height=\"894\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>What if you implicitly knew that your connection was secure because nobody else was using it? That’s what Cloudflare Network Interconnect allows you to guarantee: private, performant connectivity back to Cloudflare.</p><p>By configuring Access and CNI together, you get protected application access over a private link. Cloudflare Aegis provides a dedicated IP that allows you to apply network-level firewall policies to ensure that your solution is completely airgapped: no one can access your application but Cloudflare-protected Access calls that come from their own dedicated IP address.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5ckxEDcHts2Ui6RsEBDyUH/500ea5bac401cb9f60afed1622e7958b/pasted-image-0--4-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1530\" height=\"894\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Even if somebody could access your application over the CNI, they would get blocked by your firewall because they didn’t go through Access.
