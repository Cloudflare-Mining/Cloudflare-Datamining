However, with increased productivity comes increased risk, as employees turn to unapproved SaaS and Gen AI applications, often dumping sensitive data into them for quick productivity wins. </p><p>The prevalence of “Shadow IT” and “Shadow AI” creates multiple problems for security, IT, GRC and legal teams. For example:</p><ul><li><p>Gen AI applications may train their models on user inputs, which could expose proprietary corporate information to third parties, competitors, or even through clever attacks like <a href=\"https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm01-prompt-injection/\"><u>prompt injection</u></a>. </p></li><li><p>Applications may retain user data for long periods, share data with <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/02/deepseek-found-to-be-sharing-user-data-with-tiktok-parent-company-bytedance#:~:text=PIPC%20said%20that%20DeepSeek%E2%80%94an,without%20disclosure%20or%20explicit%20consent.\"><u>third parties</u></a>, have <a href=\"https://www.wiz.io/blog/38-terabytes-of-private-data-accidentally-exposed-by-microsoft-ai-researchers\"><u>lax security practices</u></a>, suffer a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/mcdonalds-ai-hiring-chat-bot-paradoxai/\"><u>data breach</u></a>, or even go <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/24/nx-s1-5338622/23andme-bankruptcy-genetic-data-privacy\"><u>bankrupt</u></a>, leaving sensitive data exposed to the highest bidder.  </p></li><li><p>Gen AI applications may produce outputs that are biased, unsafe or incorrect, leading to <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_ATA(2025)769509\"><u>compliance violations</u></a> or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65735769\"><u>bad</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/31/microsoft-accused-of-damaging-guardians-reputation-with-ai-generated-poll\"><u>business</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/insight-amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK0AG/\"><u>decisions</u></a>.</p></li></ul><p>In spite of these problems, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/the-net/banning-ai/\"><u>blanket bans of Gen AI</u></a> don&#39;t work. They stifle innovation and push employee usage underground. Instead, organizations need smarter controls.</p><p>Security, IT, legal and GRC teams therefore face a difficult challenge: how can you appropriately assess each third-party application, without auditing and crafting individual policies for every single one of them that your employees might decide to interact with? And with the rate at which they’re proliferating — how could you possibly hope to keep abreast of them all?</p><p>Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re helping these teams automate assessment of SaaS and Gen AI applications at scale with the introduction of our new <b>Cloudflare Application Confidence Scores. </b>Scores will soon be available as part of our new suite of <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/best-practices-sase-for-ai/\"><u>AI Security Posture Management (AI-SPM)</u></a> features in the Cloudflare One SASE platform, enabling IT and Security administrators to identify confidence levels associated with third-party SaaS and AI applications, and ultimately write policies informed by those confidence scores. We’re starting by scoring AI applications, because that’s where the need is most urgent.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll be covering the design of our Cloudflare Application Confidence Score, focusing specifically about the features of the score and our scoring rubric.  Our current goal is to reveal the details of our scoring rubric, which is designed to be as transparent and objective as possible — while simultaneously <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ai-security/\">helping organizations of all sizes safely adopt AI</a>, and encouraging the industry and AI providers to adopt best practices for AI safety and security.  </p><p>In the future, as part of our mission to help build a better Internet, we also plan to make Cloudflare Application Confidence Scores available for free to all our customer tiers.

Instead, scores will be computed against an objective rubric that we describe in detail in this blog. Our rubric will be publicly maintained and kept up to date in the Cloudflare developer docs. </p><p>Many providers of the applications that we score are also our customers and partners, so our overarching goal is to be as fair and accountable as possible.

If something isn&#39;t publicly disclosed, we assign zero points to that component of the rubric, with no further assumptions or guesswork.  Scores are computed according to our rubric via an automated system that incorporates human oversight for accuracy.  We use crawlers to collect public information (e.g. privacy policies, compliance documents), process it using AI for extraction and to compute the resulting scores, and then send them to human analysts for a final review.   </p><p>Scores are reviewed on a periodic basis. If a vendor believes that we have mis-scored their application, they can submit supporting documentation via <a href=\"mailto:app-confidence-scores@cloudflare.com\"><u>app-confidence-scores@cloudflare.com</u></a>, and we will update their score if appropriate.</p><p>Scores are on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest confidence and 1 being the most risky. We decided to use a <b>&quot;confidence score&quot;</b> instead of a <b>&quot;risk score&quot;</b> because we can express confidence in an application when it provides clear positive evidence of good security, compliance and safety practices. An application may have good practices internally, but we cannot express confidence in these practices if they are not publicly documented. Moreover, a confidence score allows us to give customers transparent information, so they can make their own informed decisions. For example, an application might get a low confidence score because it lacks a documented data retention policy. While that might be a concern for some, your organization might find it acceptable and decide to allow the application anyway.</p><p>We separately evaluate different account tiers for the same application provider, because different account tiers can provide very different levels of enterprise risk. For instance, consumer plans (e.g. ChatGPT Free) may involve training on user prompts and score lower, whereas enterprise plans (e.g. ChatGPT Enterprise) do not train on user prompts and thus score higher. </p><p>That said, we are quite opinionated about components we selected in our rubric, drawing from deep experience of our own internal product, engineering, legal, GRC, and security teams. We prioritize factors like data retention policies and encryption standards because we believe they are foundational to protecting sensitive information in an AI-driven world. We included certifications, security frameworks and model cards because they provide evidence of maturity, stability, safety and adherence with industry best practices.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"actually-its-really-two-scores\">Actually, it’s really two Scores</h2>\n      <a href=\"#actually-its-really-two-scores\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>As AI applications emerge at an unprecedented pace, the problem of &quot;Shadow AI&quot; intensifies traditional risks associated with Shadow IT. Shadow IT applications create risk when they retain user data for long periods, have lax security practices, are financially unstable, or widely share data with third parties.  Meanwhile, AI tools create new risks when they retain and train on user prompts, or generate responses that are biased, toxic, inaccurate or unsafe. </p><p>To separate out these different risks, we provide two different Scores: </p><ul><li><p><b>Application Confidence Score</b> (5 points) covers general SaaS maturity, and</p></li><li><p><b>Gen-AI Confidence Score</b> (5 points) focused on Gen AI-specific risks.</p></li></ul><p>We chose to focus on two separate areas to make our metric extensible (so that, in the future, we can apply it to applications that are not focused on Gen AI) and to make the Scores easier to understand and reason about.   </p><p>Each Score is applied to each account tier of a given Gen AI provider. For example, here’s how we scored OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT:</p><ul><li><p><b>ChatGPT Free (App Confidence 3.3, GenAI Confidence 1)</b> received a low score due to limited enterprise controls and higher data exposure risk since by default, input data is used for model training.</p></li><li><p><b>ChatGPT Plus (App Confidence 3.3, GenAI Confidence 3)</b> scored slightly higher as it allows users to opt out of training on their input data.</p></li><li><p><b>ChatGPT Team (App Confidence 4.3, GenAI Confidence 3)</b> improved further with added collaboration safeguards and configurable data retention windows.</p></li><li><p><b>ChatGPT Enterprise (App Confidence 4.3, GenAI Confidence 4)</b> achieved the highest score, as training on input data is disabled by default while retaining the enhanced controls from the Team tier.</p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"a-detailed-look-at-our-rubric\">A detailed look at our rubric</h2>\n      <a href=\"#a-detailed-look-at-our-rubric\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We now walk through the details of the rubric behind each of our Scores.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"application-confidence-score-5-0-points-total\">Application Confidence Score (5.0 Points Total)</h3>\n      <a href=\"#application-confidence-score-5-0-points-total\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>This half evaluates the app&#39;s overall maturity as a SaaS service, drawing from enterprise best practices.</p><p><b>Regulatory Compliance:</b> Checks for key certifications that signal operational maturity.

It is crucial for AI safety and security because it offers transparency into a model&#39;s design, training data, limitations, and potential biases, enabling developers and users to understand its risks and use it responsibly. Some leading AI providers have committed to providing model cards as public documentation of safety evaluations. We included this in our rubric to encourage the industry to broadly adopt model cards as a best practice. As the practice of model cards is further developed and standardized across the industry, we hope to incorporate more fine-grained details from model cards into our own risk scores. But for now, we only include the existence (or lack thereof) of a model card in our score.</p><ul><li><p>Has its own model card: 1 point.</p></li><li><p>Uses a model with a model card: .5 points.</p></li><li><p>None: 0 points.</p></li></ul><p><b>Training on user prompts:</b> This is one of the most important components of our score.  Models that train on user prompts are very risky because users might share sensitive corporate information in user prompts. We weighted this heavily because control over training data is central to preventing unintended data exposure, a core <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/the-net/generative-ai-zero-trust/\"><u>risk in generative AI</u></a> that can lead to major incidents.</p><ul><li><p>Explicit opt-in is required for training on user prompts: 2 points.</p></li><li><p>Opt-out of training on user prompts is
