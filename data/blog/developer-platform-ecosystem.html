	<p>Deploying an application to the cloud requires a robust network, ample storage, and compute power. But that only covers the architecture, it doesn’t include all the other <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services">tools and services</a> necessary to build, deploy, and support your applications. It’s easy to get bogged down in researching whether everything you want to use works together, and that takes time away from actually developing and building.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare is focused on building a modern cloud with a developer-first experience. That developer experience includes creating an ecosystem filled with the tools and services developers need.</p>
	<p>Deciding to build an application starts with the planning and design elements. What programming languages, frameworks, or runtimes will be used? The answer to that question can influence the architecture and hosting decisions. Choosing a runtime may lock you into using specific vendors. Our goal is to provide flexibility and eliminate the friction involved when wanting to migrate on to (or off) Cloudflare.</p>
	<p>You can’t forget the tools necessary for configuration and interoperability. This can include areas such as authentication and infrastructure management. You have multiple pieces of your application that need to talk with one another to ensure a secure and seamless experience. We support and build standards for compatibility and to simplify the configuration and interoperability when deploying your applications.</p>
	<p>During the build process and after your application has been deployed, it is essential to test and verify that things are working properly. This is where logging, analytics, and alerting come in. Having the ability to quickly be notified when something isn’t working properly is part of the equation. The other part is reducing the context switching among various debugging tools and applications to quickly resolve the issue.</p>
	<p>And finally, improving your application through iterating and extending functionality. This can come from adding plug-ins from third party providers, running A/B tests to determine whether a feature is moving in the right direction, or not.</p>
	<p>At Cloudflare our mission is to help build a better Internet, all of these elements are necessary to achieve this. Our focus is on providing the network, storage, and compute power to deliver apps. We look to partners to help in the other areas and provide an ecosystem. Our intention with this strategy is to get out of the way, so developers can build faster and safer.</p>
	<p>To achieve our mission we look for partners with similar philosophies. We’ve previously announced integrations around</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-headless-cms-partnerships">Content platforms</a> to help with the planning, creating and building of applications.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/partnership-announcement-db">Database connectivity</a></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>And <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/observability-ecosystem">observability</a> to assist with debugging and troubleshooting</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Everything we do is built on the foundation of the open Internet and open standards. We want to provide choice to developers to pick from a variety of tools and may the best solution win. We believe developers should have the freedom and flexibility to choose the best tool ‘for their work’ not the best for within a ‘locked-in-platform’.</p>
	<p>We understand that partnering is key to achieving the above goal. Today, we’re excited to announce a growing ecosystem of partners who are tapping into our world’s best network. Our developer platform products and partner products fit seamlessly into existing stacks and improve developer productivity through simple development and deploy workflows.</p>

	<p>Along with having the best network in the world, we also have really good compute and database products. However, for developers to plan, build and continuously iterate, they need a host of other services to work together seamlessly to have a great building experience end to end. This is why we partnered with <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-partners-with-gitlab">DevOps platforms</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-headless-cms-partnerships">CMSs</a> to make the entire development lifecycle better.</p>
	<p>On the DevOps front, developers can create new Pages projects by connecting thier repos stored on GitLab or GitHub and make site changes there via the usual git commands.</p>

		<p>“Developers can be more productive when they create, test, secure, and deploy software from a single DevOps application instead of bouncing between multiple different tools. Cloudflare Pages’ integration with GitLab makes it easier for joint users to develop and deploy new code to Cloudflare’s network using the same syntax and git commands they’re already comfortable using.”<b>— Michael LeBeau, Alliance Manager at GitLab</b></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Also, on the CMS front, we have built deploy hooks that are the key to what allows developers to connect and trigger deployments in Cloudflare Pages via updates made in their favorite headless CMSs.</p>
