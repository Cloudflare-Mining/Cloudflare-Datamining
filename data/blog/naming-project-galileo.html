	<p>Earlier today, CloudFlare announced <a href="https://projectgalileo.org">Project Galileo</a> to protect free speech on the Web by using its sophisticated anti-DDoS resources. Seventeen (at last count) free speech, public interest, and civil society organizations are helping us identify at-risk, in-need websites for the Project. If one these websites comes under attack, CloudFlare will make sure that the website stays online.</p>

	<p>Since we’ve launched, we keep getting asked why we called it “Project Galileo.”</p>
	<h3>Subversive Moons</h3>
	<p>In 1610, Galileo Galilei fashioned a homemade telescope and pointed it towards the heavens. He saw sights never witnessed before by human eyes: moons orbiting Jupiter, rings around Saturn, sunspots, craters on the moon, and phases of Venus.</p>

	<p>These observations gave evidence for a dangerous truth—we are not the center of the universe, and the Earth revolves around the sun. Galileo published his discoveries in a book modestly entitled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_Concerning_the_Two_Chief_World_Systems"><i>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</i></a>. As reward for his discoveries, Galileo was labeled a heretic and his book was banned until 1718. The Earth was to revolve around the sun 107 more times before Galileo’s discoveries would reach a wider audience.</p>
	<p>Like Galileo, websites espousing politically sensitive—even heretical—speech are often victims of suppression. Like Galileo, most of these sites don’t have the resources to protect their discoveries from being suppressed.</p>
	<h3>“And yet it moves...”</h3>
	<p>How would history be different if Galileo’s book had been able to stay “online”? Would we have reached the moon in July 1861, not 1969?</p>
	<p>If you would like to help Project Galileo as a public interest organization, identifying those websites most in need, please visit: <a href="http://www.projectgalileo.org">www.projectgalileo.org</a>. If you would like to be a participating website, we suggest you contact one of our partner organizations so they can recommend you.</p>
