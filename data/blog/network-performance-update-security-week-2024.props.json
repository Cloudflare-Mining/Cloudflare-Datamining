Browsers around the world report the performance of those providers from the perspective of the end-user network they are on. The goal is to provide an accurate picture of where different providers are faster, and more importantly, where Cloudflare can improve. You can read more about the methodology in the <a href=\"/benchmarking-edge-network-performance/\">original Speed Week blog post</a>.</p><p>Using the RUM data, we measure various performance metrics, such as TCP Connection Time, Time to First Byte (TTFB), and Time to Last Byte (TTLB), for ourselves and other providers.</p><p>If we only collect data from a browser when we return an error page, you could see how variable the data can get: if one network or website is having a problem in a certain country, that country could overreport, meaning those networks would be more highly weighted in the calculations because more users reported from that network during a given time period.</p><p>For example, if a lot of users connecting over a small Brazilian network were generating reports because their websites were throwing errors more frequently, that could make this small network look a lot bigger to us. This small network in Brazil could have as many reports as Claro, a major network in the region, despite them being totally different when you look at the number of subscribers.  If we only look at the networks that report to us the most, it could cause smaller networks with fewer subscribers to be treated as more important because of point-in-time error conditions.</p><p>This phenomenon could cause the networks we look at to change week over week. Going back to the Brazil example, if the website that was throwing a bunch of errors fixed their problem, and we no longer saw measurements from that network, they may not show up as a “most reported network” depending on when we look at the data. This means that the networks we look at to consider where we are fastest are dependent on which networks are sending us the most reports at any given time, which is not optimal if we’re trying to get faster in these networks. We need to be able to get a consistent signal on these networks to understand where we’re faster and where we’re not.</p><p>We’ve addressed this issue by creating a fixed list of the networks we want to look at. We did this by looking at <a href=\"https://stats.labs.apnic.net/aspop/\">public stats</a> on user population by network and then comparing that with our sample sizes by network until we identified the 1000 networks we want to examine.  This ensures that day over day, the networks we look at are the same.</p><p>Now let’s talk about what makes us faster in more places than other networks: HTTP/3.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"blazing-fast-speeds-with-http-3\">Blazing fast speeds with HTTP/3</h3>\n            <a href=\"#blazing-fast-speeds-with-http-3\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>One reason why Cloudflare is the fastest in the most networks is because we’ve been leading the charge with adoption and usage of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/\">HTTP/3</a> on our platform.  HTTP/3 allows for faster connectivity behavior which means we can get connections established faster and get data flowing. HTTP/3 is currently used by around 31% of Internet traffic:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7s33L2h6voHjT9pZ3O8aev/8f197466111546b27445609c74586c31/pasted-image-0--2--1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>To show that HTTP/3 improves connection times, we looked at two different Cloudflare endpoints that these tests ran against: one with HTTP/3 enabled and one with HTTP/3 disabled. The performance difference between the two is night and day.  Here’s a table showing the performance difference for 95th percentile connect time between Cloudflare zones when one zone has HTTP/3 enabled:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-color:#ccc;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{background-color:#fff;border-color:#ccc;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#333;\n  font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{background-color:#f0f0f0;border-color:#ccc;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#333;\n  font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-buh4{background-color:#f9f9f9;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n</style>\n<table class=\"tg\" width=\"100%\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-0lax\"></th>\n    <th class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">P50 connect (ms)</span></th>\n    <th class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">P95 connect (ms)</span></th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-buh4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Cloudflare HTTP/3</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-buh4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">130</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-buh4\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">579</span></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Cloudflare non-HTTP/3</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">174</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">695</span></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>At P95, Cloudflare is 116 ms faster for connection times when HTTP/3 is enabled. This performance gain helps us be the fastest in the most networks.</p><p>But why does HTTP/3 help make us faster? HTTP/3 allows for faster connection setup times, which lets us take greater advantage of our global network footprint to be the fastest in the most networks. HTTP/3 is built on top of the QUIC protocol, which multiplexes <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/\">UDP</a> packets to allow for parallel streams to be sent at the same time. This means that TLS encryption can happen in parallel with connection establishment, shortening the amount of time that is needed to set up a secure connection. Paired with Cloudflare’s network that is incredibly close to end-users, this makes for significant latency reductions on user Connect times. All major browsers have HTTP/3 enabled by default, so you too can realize these latency improvements by <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/protocol/http3/\">enabling HTTP/3</a> on your website today.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next</h3>\n            <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>We’re sharing our updates on our journey to become #1 everywhere so that you can see what goes into running the fastest network in the world.
