Cloudflare observed a disruption in Internet traffic on that Saturday, starting at 08:00 UTC, which deepened on Sunday. Since then, the conflict has continued, and different ISPs have been affected, in some cases with a 90% drop in traffic. On May 2, Internet traffic is still ~30% lower than pre-conflict levels. This blog post will show what we’ve been seeing in terms of Internet disruption there.</p><p>On the day that clashes broke out, our data shows that traffic in the country dropped as much as 60% on Saturday, after 08:00 UTC, with a partial recovery on Sunday around 14:00, but it has consistently been lower than before. Although we saw outages and disruptions on major local Internet providers, the general drop in traffic could also be related to different human usage patterns because of the conflict, with people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/apr/26/hungry-exhausted-traumatised-sudanese-scramble-to-flee-their-homeland\">trying to leave the country</a>. In <a href=\"/one-year-of-war-in-ukraine/\">Ukraine, we saw</a> a clear drop in traffic, not always related to ISP outages, after the war started, when people were leaving the country.</p><p>Here’s the hourly perspective of Sudan’s Internet traffic over the past weeks as seen on <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/sd?range=14d\">Cloudflare Radar</a>, with the orange shading highlighting the disruption since April 15.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/Rb3bwqLvq89EqvY4PUdSX/5c6aa9133cee84364eaf164c48f56ff0/image11-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The next chart of daily traffic in Sudan (that is dominated by mobile device traffic — more on that below) clearly shows a daily drop in traffic after April 15.

There was no official reason given for those major disruptions that had a nationwide impact. That said, the disruptions were also felt in neighbor country <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/td?range=14d\">Chad</a> in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1650417100505198593\">several ISPs</a>, given that Sudan’s Sudatel (AS15706) seems to be an upstream provider.</p><p>Cloudflare saw a 74% decrease in traffic on Sunday, April 23, compared to Sunday, April 9, before the conflict, and a 70% drop on Monday, April 24, compared with Monday, April 10. In some ISPs, the impact was bigger.</p><p>In the news, ISP MTN (AS36972) reportedly blocked Internet services on April 16, and, according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/sudan-politics-internet-idAFL1N36J071\">Reuters</a>, was told by the authorities to restore it a few hours after. We saw a clear outage in that ASN, an almost 90% drop in traffic compared with previous weeks for about 10 hours, after 00:00 UTC on April 16, and it mostly recovered after 10:00 UTC.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6GrvytJHqY35xYGp62aBtD/37fccdda80b10512086df582911be325/image10-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1042\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The most impacted ISPs were Sudatel (AS15706), Zain (AS36998), and Canar (AS33788) with almost complete outages. Canar was the outage that lasted the longest, with 83 hours, from April 21 to 25. Next, it was the main ISP in the country, Sudatel, with 40 hours of almost complete Internet blackout, followed by Zain, with 10 hours on April 24.</p><p>The return of traffic coincided with the time a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/announcement-of-nationwide-ceasefire-in-sudan/\">nationwide ceasefire</a> of 72 hours was agreed upon on April 24.</p><p>BGP or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/\">Border Gateway Protocol</a> is a mechanism to exchange routing information between networks on the Internet, and a crucial part that enables the existence of the network of networks (the Internet).

In this case, highlighted in the next chart, BGP updates biggest spikes from Sudatel (AS15706) are consistent with both the start of the outage, and the return to traffic.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5ivTdSm2MJb4NcpUswg2Cp/9c2751537798fded4250c519b3b7b09b/image9-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"699\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"mobile-device-traffic-percentage-grew-after-april-15\">Mobile device traffic percentage grew after April 15</h3>\n            <a href=\"#mobile-device-traffic-percentage-grew-after-april-15\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Sudan is typically one of the countries with the highest percentage of mobile device traffic in the world.

That drop in traffic is consistent with Ramadan trends we discussed recently in a <a href=\"/easter-passover-ramadan-internet-trends-2023/\">blog post</a>. It is related to the Iftar, the first meal after sunset that breaks the fast and often serves as a family or community event — sunset in Khartoum, Sudan, is at 18:07.</p><p>As of this Tuesday, Internet traffic data (from a linear perspective) shows that traffic continues to be much lower than before, and this morning at 08:00 UTC it is ~30% lower than it was three weeks ago (pre-conflict), at the same time, showing some recovery in the past couple of days.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3oR1nzrTY18KaMOqwL1E74/478d3bf6dbfcc8ed7cf16e2ba083df82/image7-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"799\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-65394740\">BBC</a>, reporting from Sudan, the Internet continues to be impacted, an observation that is consistent with our data.</p><p>Looking more closely at Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, where most people live and the conflict began, traffic was impacted after April 15 (the blue line in the next chart).
