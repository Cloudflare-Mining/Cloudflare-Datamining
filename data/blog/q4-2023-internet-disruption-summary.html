	<p>Cloudflare’s network spans more than 310 cities in over 120 countries, where we interconnect with over 13,000 network providers in order to provide a broad range of services to millions of customers. The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions.</p>
	<p>During previous quarters, we tracked a number of government directed Internet shutdowns in Iraq, intended to prevent cheating on academic exams. We expected to do so again during the fourth quarter, but there turned out to be no need to, as <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#governmentdirected">discussed below</a>. While we didn’t see that set of expected shutdowns, we did observe a number of other Internet outages and disruptions due to a number of commonly seen causes, including <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#fibercabletrouble">fiber/cable issues</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#poweroutages">power outages</a>, extreme <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#weather">weather</a>, infrastructure <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#maintenance">maintenance</a>, general <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#technicalproblems">technical problems</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#cyberattacks">cyberattacks</a>, and unfortunately, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#militaryaction">military action</a>.

	<p>In a slight departure from the usual subject of this blog post, this time we lead off with coverage of government directed Internet shutdowns that didn’t happen. <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/iq">Iraq</a> has been a frequent subject of this series of posts, as they have historically implemented daily multi-hour Internet shutdowns during exam periods, intended to prevent cheating. Earlier this year, there was some hope that this practice might be ending, and in our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q2-2023-internet-disruption-summary">Q2 2023 Internet disruption summary</a> post, we noted “<i>In the weeks prior to the start of this year’s shutdowns, it was </i><a href="https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/31453-Iraq%E2%80%99s-communication-ministry-refuses-to-enforce-internet-blackout-for-final-exams"><i>reported</i></a><i> that the Iraqi Ministry of Communications had announced it had refused a request from the Ministry of Education to impose an Internet shutdown during the exams as part of efforts to prevent cheating. Unfortunately, this refusal was short-lived, with shutdowns ultimately starting two weeks later.</i>” In addition to these second quarter shutdowns, they also occurred during the third quarter across multiple weeks in July, August, and September.</p>
	<p>During the fourth quarter, the third round of 12th grade high school final exams was scheduled to begin on November 13 and end on November 21, taking place at 13:00 local time, as shown in the schedule below, which was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=661695112830032&amp;set=pb.100069686486016.-2207520000&amp;type=3">published</a> on the Iraqi Ministry of Education’s Facebook page.</p>

	<p>November 2023 exam schedule in Iraq</p>
	<p>However, in looking at Internet traffic for Iraq during that period, it appears that the nationwide Internet shutdowns that would have normally taken place did not occur, as the graph shows a very consistent diurnal pattern with no evidence of disruptions to Internet connectivity like we have seen in the past. Additionally, other <a href="https://twitter.com/accessnow">civil society groups</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IODA_live">academic researchers</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dougmadory">Internet analysts</a> that also monitor these shutdowns did not report seeing any related drops in traffic. It is unclear whether a request for shutdowns was submitted by the Ministry of Education and again refused by the Ministry of Communications, or if no request was ever submitted for this round of exams. Regardless, we hope that Iraq continues to keep the Internet connected during future rounds of exams.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

	<p>On Saturday, October 7, 2023, attacks from the Palestinian group Hamas launched from the Gaza Strip against the south of Israel started a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2023_Gaza%E2%88%92Israel_conflict">conflict</a> in the region, with Israel <a href="https://apnews.com/live/israel-hamas-war-live-updates#0000018b-0f83-d2a1-a1df-8fcb0a320000">officially declaring</a> the next day that it was at war. This had an almost immediate impact on Internet traffic in both <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/il">Israel</a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ps">Palestine</a>, with traffic in the former showing ~170% growth as compared to the prior week, and ~100% growth in the latter as compared to the previous week. These trends are discussed in our October 9 blog post, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-traffic-patterns-in-israel-and-palestine-following-the-october-2023-attacks"><i>Internet traffic patterns in Israel and Palestine following the October 2023 attacks</i></a>.</p>
	<p>However, in the hours and days following the initial attacks, a number of Palestinian Internet providers saw traffic fall significantly, with many winding up largely or totally offline, potentially as a result of power outages caused by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-rockets-airstrikes-tel-aviv-11fb98655c256d54ecb5329284fc37d2">retaliatory Israeli airstrikes</a>.

	<p>In addition to the outages illustrated above, throughout October, November, and December, <a href="https://www.paltel.ps/en/home">Paltel (Palestine Telecommunications Company)</a> posted a number of times on <a href="https://twitter.com/Paltelco">its official X account</a> about disruptions to its landline, mobile, and Internet services, citing causes including <a href="https://twitter.com/Paltelco/status/1718007432494911717">fiber damage due to bombardment</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Paltelco/status/1724727009673101574">fuel depletion</a>.

	<p>On December 7 &amp; 8, a near-complete outage observed in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/td">Chad</a> was <a href="https://www.msn.com/fr-xl/actualite/other/tchad-connexion-internet-r%C3%A9tablie-apr%C3%A8s-des-heures-de-coupure/ar-AA1lcaMM">reportedly</a> due to fiber optic cable cuts in neighboring countries. A published article cited <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as328594">SudaChad</a> as claiming that the outage seen in the graphs below was due to an issue with CAMTEL, a <a href="https://www.camertoday.com/camtel-and-sudachad-assess-relationship-pledge-further-commitment-for-better-results">Cameroonian partner</a>. It also cites <a href="https://moovafrica.td">Moov Africa’s (formerly known as Millicom Chad)</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moovafrica.td/posts/pfbid0V63Pse2WEMqB5FsdkzAwwJppZLjwJry9MeYV8jUZZUNJZqu9WFG6fQfAURbMKop2l">apology</a> to customers, which points at “<i>the fiber-optic cut in Cameroon and Sudan</i>'' as the root cause. Since simultaneous cuts in fiber optic cables in Chad’s two neighboring countries would certainly be an unusual occurrence, it isn’t clear if such an event happened, though <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as328594">routing data for SudaChad</a> shows that the network’s two upstream providers are <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as15706">AS15706 (Sudatel)</a> in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/sd">Sudan</a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as15964">AS15964 (CAMNET)</a> in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/cm">Cameroon</a>.

	<p>The disruption lasted approximately fourteen hours, from 20:00 local time on December 7 until 10:15 local time on December 8 (19:00 UTC on December 7 until 09:15 UTC on December 8), with the impact visible country-wide, as well as at SudaChad and several downstream network providers.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

	<p>Ukrainian Internet provider Kyivstar <a href="https://twitter.com/TwiyKyivstar/status/1734527519972298888">announced</a> on the morning of December 12 that they were the “target of a powerful hacker attack”. They noted that the attack caused a “technical failure” that resulted in mobile communication and Internet access becoming temporarily unavailable. Although <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as15895">Kyivstar</a> has been targeted by around <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/ukraine-s-main-phone-operator-recovering-two-days-after-cyberattack-41ba9ee3">500 cyberattacks</a> since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, this was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/ukraines-kyivstar-restores-services-after-cyberattack-parent-veon-says-2023-12-19">reportedly</a> the largest attack to date. A <a href="https://therecord.media/russians-infiltrated-kyivstar-months-before">subsequent report</a> referenced an interview with Illia Vitiuk, the head of the cybersecurity department at Ukraine’s security service (SBU), in which he claimed that “<i>the hackers attempted to penetrate Kyivstar in March 2023 or earlier, managed to get into the system at least as early as May, and likely gained full access to the network in November.</i>”</p>
	<p>Recovery took several days, with Kyivstar <a href="https://twitter.com/TwiyKyivstar/status/1735732558783033831">posting</a> on December 15 that “the Internet is everywhere” but warning that connection speeds might be slightly reduced. These posts align with the traffic disruption shown in the figure below, which lasted from 06:30 local time (04:30 UTC) on December 12 until 14:00 local time (12:00 UTC) on December 15.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

	<p>On October 25, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Otis">Hurricane Otis</a> made landfall near Acapulco, a popular tourist destination in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/mx">Mexico</a>. In addition to catastrophic structural damage, it was <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news/hurricane-otis-causes-catastrophic-damage-acapulco-mexico">reported</a> that “<i>more than 10,000 utility poles were destroyed, knocking out power and internet/communications across the region, while numerous transmission lines, electrical substations, and a power plant were also heavily damaged.</i>” This damage to electrical and communications infrastructure in the area resulted in significant disruption to Internet connectivity. As shown in the graph below, Internet traffic from Acapulco dropped by around 80% as Otis made landfall. Traffic started to show some growth in early November, but peak volumes remained relatively consistent, and well below pre-hurricane levels, through the end of the year. (Several large spikes are visible on December 26 &amp; 30, but it isn’t clear what those are associated with.) Although Acapulco’s tourism industry <a href="https://bnnbreaking.com/world/mexico/acapulcos-resilience-from-hurricane-devastation-to-holiday-destination">experienced a notable recovery</a> heading into the end of the year, it appears that infrastructure recovery has not been quite as swift.</p>

	<p>Last quarter, we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2023-internet-disruption-summary/#fire">reported</a> on the impact of wildfires that started on August 7 in Hawaii, including killing nearly 100 people, as well as destroying homes, businesses, and infrastructure, causing power outages and disrupting Internet connectivity. One of the most impacted areas was the town of Lahaina, where Internet connectivity remained sparse for weeks after the fires began. Repair and restoration efforts continued throughout the fourth quarter, with traffic clearly growing throughout October, with peak levels in November and December approaching pre-fire levels.</p>

	<p>Two maintenance-related Internet disruptions impacted Internet connectivity in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ye">Yemen</a> in the fourth quarter. The first lasted over four hours during the morning of November 10, from 03:10 - 07:45 local time (00:10 - 04:45 UTC), and followed two other disruptions the prior day. The impact was visible at a country level, as well as at a network level on <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as30873">PTC-YemenNet (AS30873)</a>.</p>

	<p>The second maintenance-related disruption occurred on December 15 just before 23:00 local time (20:00 UTC). An X <a href="https://twitter.com/AlnomeirMosfer/status/1735770808545423518">post from Mosfer Alnomeir</a>, the Minister of Telecommunication and Information Technology in Yemen, explained what happened: “<i>We note that half an hour ago there was an interruption in the Internet service that lasted approximately 30 minutes.

During the upgrade, the Optus network received changes in routing information from an alternate Singtel peering router. These routing changes were propagated through multiple layers of our IP Core network. As a result, at around 4:05am (AEDT), the pre-set safety limits on a significant number of Optus network routers were exceeded.</i>” The report also detailed the recovery efforts and timelines for consumer Internet, DNS, and mobile services.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2023-11-07&amp;dateEnd=2023-11-08&amp;location=as4804&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

Although <a href="https://pub468.ayam.news/115707">one news report claimed</a> that the disruption, which occurred between 14:15 - 00:00 local time (12:15 - 22:00 UTC), was due to damage to the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/flag-europe-asia-fea">FLAG</a> and <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/seamewe-4">SeaMeWe-4</a> submarine cables, a <a href="https://twitter.com/telecomegypt/status/1732300454711755192">subsequent post from Telecom Egypt</a> about service restoration dispelled that claim, noting “<i>The company also confirms that there is no truth to what has been circulated on some social media sites about the presence of a break in one of the submarine cables.</i>”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2023-12-05&amp;dateEnd=2023-12-06&amp;location=as36992&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

	<p>Within the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#internet-outages">Cloudflare Radar 2023 Year in Review</a>, we highlighted over 180 major Internet disruptions that were observed year-to-date through the end of November, though the actual number was likely closer to 200 by the end of the year. While that may seem like a lot, it is worth nothing that the actual number is even higher, as these posts are not exhaustive in their coverage of such events. For example, while we covered the Internet shutdown in Manipur, India that took place across multiple months in 2023, <a href="https://internetshutdowns.in">internetshutdowns.in</a> shows that over 90 more smaller localized shutdowns were put into place across the country.</p>
	<p>In addition, 2024 is shaping up to be an important year for elections, with voting taking place in more than <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/12/2024-elections-around-world">50 countries around the world</a>. Unfortunately, some countries have taken to implementing Internet shutdowns or otherwise disrupting Internet connectivity during elections. The <a href="https://freedomonlinecoalition.com/joint-statement-internet-shutdowns-and-elections">Freedom Online Coalition’s Joint Statement on Internet Shutdowns and Elections</a> details the detrimental effects of such actions. The Cloudflare Radar team will be monitoring for election-related Internet shutdowns, sharing our observations on the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center">Cloudflare Radar Outage Center</a>, via social media, and in posts on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/cloudflare-radar">blog.cloudflare.com</a>.</p>
