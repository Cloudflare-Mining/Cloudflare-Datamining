	<p>It was just last month that <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/mid-2022-new-cities/">we announced</a> our network had <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/250-cities-is-just-the-start/">grown</a> to over 270 <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ten-new-cities-four-new-countries/">cities</a> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/expanding-to-25-plus-cities-in-brazil/">globally</a>. Today, we’re announcing that with recent additions we’ve reached 275 cities. With each new city we add, we help make the Internet faster, more reliable, and more secure. In this post, we’ll talk about the cities we added, the performance increase, and look closely at our network expansion in India.</p>
	<h2 id="the-cities">The Cities</h2>
	<p>Here are the four new cities we added in the last month: <strong>Ahmedabad</strong>, India; <strong>Chandigarh</strong>, India; <strong>Jeddah</strong>, Saudi Arabia; and <strong>Yogyakarta</strong>, Indonesia. </p>
	<h3 id="a-closer-look-at-india">A closer look at India</h3>
	<p>India is home to one of the largest and most rapidly growing bases of digital consumers. Recognising this, Cloudflare has increased its footprint in India in order to optimize reachability to users within the country. </p>
	<p>Cloudflare’s expansion in India is facilitated through interconnections with several of the largest Internet Service Providers (ISPs), mobile network providers and Internet Exchange points (IXPs). At present, we are directly connected to the major networks that account for more than 95% of the country’s broadband subscribers. We are continuously working to not only expand the interconnection capacity and locations with these networks, but also establish new connections to the networks that we have yet to interconnect with. </p>
	<p>In 2020, we were served through seven cities in the country. Since then, we have added our network presence in another five cities, totaling to 12 cities in India. In the case of one of our biggest partners, with whom we interconnect in these 12 cities, Cloudflare’s latency performance is better in comparison to other major platforms, as shown in the chart below.</p>

	<h3 id="helping-make-the-internet-faster">Helping make the Internet faster</h3>
	<p>Every time we add a new location, we help make the Internet a little bit faster. The reason is every new location brings our content and services closer to the person (or machine) that requested them. Instead of driving 25 minutes to the grocery store, it’s like one opened in your neighborhood.</p>
	<p>In the case of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, we already have six other locations in two different cities in Saudi Arabia. Still, by adding this new location, we were able to improve median performance (TCP RTT latency) by 26% from 81ms to 60ms. 20 milliseconds doesn’t sound like a lot, right? But this location is serving almost 10 million requests per day. That’s approximately 55 hours <em>per day</em> that someone (or something) wasn’t waiting for data.</p>

	<p>As we continue to put dots on the map, we’ll keep putting updates here on how Internet performance is improving. As we like to say, we’re just getting started. </p>
