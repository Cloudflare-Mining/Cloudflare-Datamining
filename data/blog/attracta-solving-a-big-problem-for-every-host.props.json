He has been at the company since its inception, working on the executive management team and building the business.</p>\n<p>We sat down with Troy at HostingCon and asked, what exactly does Attracta do? &quot;Attracta makes the worlds most popular search engine optimization platform,&quot; said Troy. &quot;We solve a really big problem for every host here at HostingCon.&quot;</p>\n<p>According to Troy, if a customer purchases a site through a host and then searches for their site in Google, only to find their site isn't there, it can be a big problem for the host. Attracta solves that problem by crawling the site and offering a XML Sitemap of the site to major search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, Bing and Ask.</p>\n<p>Attracta currently has more than 2.3 million customers and adds over 100,000 customers a month.</p>\n<p><em>At HostingCon 2012, <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/\">CloudFlare</a> co-founder <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/zatlyn\">Michelle Zatlyn</a> sat down with 28 leading experts in the hosting industry.
