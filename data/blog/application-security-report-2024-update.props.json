Geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with an active 2024 voting season in many countries across the world, has led to a substantial increase in malicious traffic activity across the Internet. In this report, we take a look at Cloudflare’s perspective on Internet application security.</p><p>This report is the fourth edition of our Application Security Report and is an official update to our <a href=\"/application-security-report-q2-2023\">Q2 2023 report</a>. New in this report is a section focused on client-side security within the context of web applications.</p><p>Throughout the report we discuss various insights. From a global standpoint, mitigated traffic across the whole network now averages 7%, and WAF and Bot mitigations are the source of over half of that. While DDoS attacks remain the number one attack vector used against web applications, targeted CVE attacks are also worth keeping an eye on, as we have seen exploits as fast as 22 minutes after a proof of concept was released.</p><p>Focusing on bots, about a third of all traffic we observe is automated, and of that, the vast majority (93%) is not generated by bots in Cloudflare’s verified list and is potentially malicious.</p><p>API traffic is also still growing, now accounting for 60% of all traffic, and maybe more concerning, is that organizations have up to a quarter of their API endpoints not accounted for.</p><p>We also touch on client side security and the proliferation of third-party integrations in web applications. On average, enterprise sites integrate 47 third-party endpoints according to Page Shield data.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning that since the last report, our network, from which we gather the data and insights, is bigger and faster: we are now processing an average of 57 million HTTP requests/second (<b>+23.9%</b> YoY) and 77 million at peak (<b>+22.2%</b> YoY). From a DNS perspective, we are handling 35 million DNS queries per second (<b>+40%</b> YoY). This is the sum of authoritative and resolver requests served by our infrastructure.</p><p>Maybe even more noteworthy, is that, focusing on HTTP requests only, in Q1 2024 Cloudflare blocked an average of 209 billion cyber threats each day (<b>+86.6%</b> YoY). That is a substantial increase in relative terms compared to the same time last year.</p><p>As usual, before we dive in, we need to define our terms.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"definitions\">Definitions</h2>\n            <a href=\"#definitions\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Throughout this report, we will refer to the following terms:</p><ul><li><p><b>Mitigated traffic:</b> any eyeball HTTP* request that had a “terminating” action applied to it by the Cloudflare platform. These include the following actions: <code>BLOCK</code>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/cloudflare-challenges/#legacy-captcha-challenge\"><code>CHALLENGE</code></a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/cloudflare-challenges/#js-challenge\"><code>JS_CHALLENGE</code></a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/cloudflare-challenges/#managed-challenge-recommended\"><code>MANAGED_CHALLENGE</code></a>. This does not include requests that had the following actions applied: <code>LOG</code>, <code>SKIP</code>, <code>ALLOW</code>. They also accounted for a relatively small percentage of requests. Additionally, we improved our calculation regarding the <code>CHALLENGE</code> type actions to ensure that only unsolved challenges are counted as mitigated. A detailed <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/actions/\">description of actions</a> can be found in our developer documentation. This has not changed from last year’s report.</p></li><li><p><b>Bot traffic/automated traffic</b>: any HTTP* request identified by Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/\">Bot Management</a> system as being generated by a bot. This includes requests with a <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/\">bot score</a> between <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/\">1 and 29</a> inclusive. This has not changed from last year’s report.</p></li><li><p><b>API traffic</b>: any HTTP* request with a response content type of XML or JSON. Where the response content type is not available, such as for mitigated requests, the equivalent Accept content type (specified by the user agent) is used instead. In this latter case, API traffic won’t be fully accounted for, but it still provides a good representation for the purposes of gaining insights.

For example, if we filter on CVEs that result in remote code execution (RCE), we see clear attempts to exploit Apache and Adobe installations towards the end of 2023 and start of 2024 along with a notable campaign targeting Citrix in May of this year.</p><p><b>Figure 4:</b> Worldwide daily number of requests for Code Execution CVEs</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5A2f3Shrcp7rw6zmE9VoNa/90dd0ab1a3e9a80dddfc3c893bebb283/unnamed--1--4.png\" alt=\"CVE exploit campaigns clearly visible in attack traffic\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"393\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Similar views become clearly visible when focusing on other CVEs or specific attack categories.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"ddos-attacks-remain-the-most-common-attack-against-web-applications\">DDoS attacks remain the most common attack against web applications</h3>\n            <a href=\"#ddos-attacks-remain-the-most-common-attack-against-web-applications\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>DDoS attacks remain the most common attack type against web applications, with DDoS comprising 37.1% of all mitigated application traffic over the time period considered.</p><p><b>Figure 5:</b> Volume of HTTP DDoS attacks over time</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3578XXGADnTHyYT6Kdf6ez/19dc83ad5c2b4989d0542f39fb755fa5/unnamed--6--3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"356\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We saw a large increase in volumetric attacks in February and March 2024. This was partly the result of improved detections deployed by our teams, in addition to increased attack activity. In the first quarter of 2024 alone, Cloudflare’s automated defenses mitigated 4.5 million unique DDoS attacks, an amount equivalent to 32% of all the DDoS attacks Cloudflare mitigated in 2023. Specifically, application layer HTTP DDoS attacks increased by 93% YoY and 51% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ).</p><p>Cloudflare correlates DDoS attack traffic and defines unique attacks by looking at event start and end times along with target destination.</p><p>Motives for launching DDoS attacks range from targeting specific organizations for financial gains (ransom), to testing the capacity of botnets, to targeting institutions and countries for political reasons. As an example, Cloudflare observed a 466% increase in DDoS attacks on Sweden after its acceptance to the NATO alliance on March 7, 2024. This mirrored the DDoS pattern observed during Finland’s NATO acceptance in 2023. The size of DDoS attacks themselves are also increasing.</p><p>In August 2023, Cloudflare mitigated a hyper-volumetric <a href=\"/zero-day-rapid-reset-http2-record-breaking-ddos-attack\">HTTP/2 Rapid Reset</a> DDoS attack that peaked at 201 million requests per second (rps) – three times larger than any previously observed attack. In the attack, threat actors exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the HTTP/2 protocol that had the potential to incapacitate nearly any server or application supporting HTTP/2. This underscores how menacing DDoS vulnerabilities are for unprotected organizations.</p><p>Gaming and gambling became the most targeted sector by DDoS attacks, followed by Internet technology companies and cryptomining.</p><p><b>Figure 6:</b> Largest HTTP DDoS attacks as seen by Cloudflare, by year</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1FYxByBvHz2MQQ8WhKErWk/a7f757447c04820ea5a642838b3e5e10/image1.jpg\" alt=\"Largest DDoS attacks by year\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1092\" height=\"637\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"bot-traffic-insights\">Bot traffic insights</h2>\n            <a href=\"#bot-traffic-insights\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare has continued to invest heavily in our bot detection systems.
