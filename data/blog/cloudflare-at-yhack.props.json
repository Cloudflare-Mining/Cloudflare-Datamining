Our team of five wanted to support, educate, and positively impact the experience and learning of these college students.

Mentoring</h6><p>Our team of five mentors from three different teams and two different Cloudflare locations (San Francisco and Austin) was available at the Cloudflare table or via Slack for almost every hour of the event. There were a few hours in the early morning when all of us were asleep, I&#39;m sure, but we were available to help otherwise.</p><h6>2. Providing challenges</h6><p>Cloudflare submitted two challenges to the student attendees, encouraging them to protect and improve the performance of their projects and/or create an opportunity for exposure to 6 million+ potential users of their apps.</p><p><b>Challenge 1</b>: Put Cloudflare in front of your hackathon project</p><p><b>Challenge 2</b>. Make a Cloudflare App</p><p>Prizes were awarded to all teams which completed these challenges. Cloudflare awarded a total of ten teams for completing the challenges. The team which was judged to have created the best Cloudflare app won free admission to Cloudflare&#39;s 2018 <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/internet-summit/\">Internet Summit</a> as well as several swag items and introductions to Cloudflare teams offering internships next summer.</p><h6>3. Distributing swag &amp; cookies</h6><p>Over 3,000 swag items (t-shirts, laptop stickers, and laptop camera covers) were distributed to almost every attendee. When the Cloudflare team noticed student attendees were going without snacks after dinner, I made a trip to a local grocery store and bought hundreds of cookies to distribute as well. After about an hour, none remained.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/p0q51OvPWdhYOEiuOnO22/f69e7f62b33caf2a2f9b6a600c8567c9/Cookies-1.JPG.jpeg\" alt=\"Cloudflare cookies?\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2344\" height=\"1758\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><h6>4. Sponsoring</h6><p>As with most any hackathon, costs for food, A/V, venue rental, and other expenses are considerable. Cloudflare decided to financially support YHack to help offset some of these costs and be sure student participants were able to attend, learn, and build meaningful projects without having to pay admission fees.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"results-of-the-hackathon\">Results of the hackathon</h3>\n      <a href=\"#results-of-the-hackathon\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In groups of up to four, students teamed up to create projects.

Ultimately, Money Moves will help investors select the best possible financial advisor in their region.</p><p>The Money Moves team liked that they could easily use Cloudflare to protect and improve the performance of their site. One of the team members, Muyiwa Olaniyan, already used Cloudflare to run his personal server at home, so the team decided to use Cloudflare, from the start.</p><p>Read more about Money Moves on the team&#39;s <a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/finralyze\">Devpost page</a> or <a href=\"https://www.finralyze.com/\">website</a>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/mad-invest\">Mad Invest</a></h3>\n      <a href=\"#\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=https://devpost.com/software/mad-invest>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2zit5IiefevizKY5Q7DSff/d413709220a405f884e2f4ef77c9ccb2/158.JPG.jpeg\" alt=\"Mad Invewst\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2227\" height=\"1670\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>&quot;Smart Bitcoin Investing Chatbot&quot;</p><p>When the Facebook messenger chatbot is asked when it is best to invest in Bitcoin, current market trends are observed and a Mad Invest&#39;s model predicts how likely it is for the price to go up or down.

I was pleased to hear many attendees had already heard of or used Cloudflare before and many teams interacted with Cloudflare to protect and improve the performance of their projects and develop new apps. I look forward to being involved many more events in 2018 as well.</p>",
