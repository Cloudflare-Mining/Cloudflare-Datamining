The CDN was one of our first services and originally designed to serve HTML content like webpages. User attempts to serve video and other large files hosted outside of Cloudflare were disruptive on many levels. So, years ago, we added Section 2.8 to give Cloudflare the means to preserve the original intent of the CDN: limiting use of the CDN to webpages.</p><p>Over time, Cloudflare’s network became larger and more robust and its portfolio broadened to include services like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/\">Stream</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-images/\">Images</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/\">R2</a>. These services are explicitly designed to allow customers to serve non-HTML content like video, images, and other large files hosted directly by Cloudflare. And yet, Section 2.8 persisted in our Self-Serve Subscription Agreement–the umbrella terms that apply to <i>all</i> services. We acknowledge that this didn’t make much sense.</p><p>To address the problem, we’ve done a few things. First, we moved the content-based restriction concept to a new <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/service-specific-terms-application-services/\">CDN-specific section</a> in our Service-Specific Terms. We want to be clear that this restriction only applies to use of our CDN. Next, we got rid of the antiquated HTML vs. non-HTML construct, which was far too broad. Finally, we made it clear that customers can serve video and other large files using the CDN so long as that content is hosted by a Cloudflare service like Stream, Images, or R2. This will allow customers to confidently innovate on our Developer Platform while leveraging the speed, security, and reliability of our CDN. Video and large files hosted outside of Cloudflare will still be restricted on our CDN, but we think that our service features, generous free tier, and competitive pricing (including <a href=\"/r2-ga/\">zero egress fees on R2</a>) make for a compelling package for developers that want to access the reach and performance of our network.</p><p>Here are a few diagrams to help understand how our terms of service fit together for various use cases.</p><p><i>Customer A is on a free, pro, or business plan and wants to use the CDN service:</i></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6egDNDn9C9wcJGp22GEm7n/96ba1f278b6c538d698b0a5d40fd729d/Blog-1792---Customer-A.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1324\" height=\"780\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Customer B is on a free, pro, or business plan and wants to use the Developer Platform and Zero Trust services:</b></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3nWwUG8zvmVvPmUDmrDnJL/e279ee5a2e17145f9ce43f4014c14212/Blog-1792---Customer-B.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1324\" height=\"781\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Customer C is on a free, pro, or business plan and wants to use Stream with the CDN service and</i> Web Application Firewall <i>with the CDN service:</i></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4EivnjP1JbfXnPg21BytB8/174010bfa39cabea1ff2d9b58653c804/Blog-1792---Customer-C.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1324\" height=\"781\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"quality-of-life-upgrades\">Quality of life upgrades</h3>\n      <a href=\"#quality-of-life-upgrades\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We also took this opportunity to tune up other aspects of our Terms of Service to make for a more user-first experience.
