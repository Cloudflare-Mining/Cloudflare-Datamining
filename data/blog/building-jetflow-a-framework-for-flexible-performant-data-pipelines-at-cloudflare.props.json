As more use cases were onboarded to <b>Jetflow,</b> we had to make sure that if someone wrote a new stage it would be compatible with the other stages. We don’t want to create a situation where new code needs to be written for every output format and target system, or you end up with a custom pipeline for every different use case.</p><p>The way we have solved this problem is by having our stage extractor class only allow output data in a single format. This means as long as any downstream stages support this format as in the input and output format they would be compatible with the rest of the pipeline. This seems obvious in retrospect, but internally was a painful learning experience, as we originally created a custom type system and struggled with stage interoperability. </p><p>For this internal format, we chose to use <a href=\"https://arrow.apache.org/\"><u>Arrow</u></a>, an in-memory columnar data format. The key benefits of this format for us are:</p><ul><li><p><b>Arrow ecosystem</b>: Many data projects now support Arrow as an output format. This means when we write extractor stages for new data sources, it is often trivial to produce Arrow output.</p></li><li><p><b>No serialisation overhead</b>: This makes it easy to move Arrow data between machines and even programming languages with minimum overhead. <b>Jetflow</b> was designed from the start to have the flexibility to be able to run in a wide range of systems via a job controller interface, so this efficiency in data transmission means there’s minimal compromise on performance when creating distributed implementations.</p></li><li><p><b>Reserve memory in large fixed-size batches to avoid memory allocations</b>: As Go is a garbage collected (GC) language and GC cycle times are affected mostly by the number of objects rather than the sizes of those objects, fewer heap objects reduces CPU time spent garbage collecting significantly, even if the total size is the same. As the number of objects to scan, and possibly collect, during a GC cycle increases with the number of allocations, if we have 8192 rows with 10 columns each, Arrow would only require us to do 10 allocations versus the 8192 allocations of most drivers that allocate on a row by row basis, meaning fewer objects and lower GC cycle times with Arrow.</p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h5 id=\"converting-rows-to-columns\">Converting rows to columns</h5>\n      <a href=\"#converting-rows-to-columns\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Another important performance optimization was reducing the number of conversion steps that happen when reading and processing data. Most data ingestion frameworks internally represent data as rows. In our case, we are mostly writing data in Parquet format, which is column based. When reading data from column-based sources (e.g. ClickHouse, where most drivers receive RowBinary format), converting into row-based memory representations for the specific language implementation is inefficient. This is then converted again from rows to columns to write Parquet files. These conversions result in a significant performance impact.</p><p><b>Jetflow</b> instead reads data from column-based sources in columnar formats (e.g. for ClickHouse-native Block format) and then copies this data into Arrow column format. Parquet files are then written directly from Arrow columns.

This had a dramatic effect on performance in comparison to the standard Go driver. Combined with the framework optimisations above, we now <b>ingest millions of rows per second</b> with a single ClickHouse connection.</p><p>A valuable lesson learned is that as with any software, tradeoffs are often made for the sake of convenience or a common use case that may not match your own. Most database drivers tend not to be optimized for reading large batches of rows, and have high per-row overhead.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h5 id=\"case-study-postgres\">Case study: Postgres</h5>\n      <a href=\"#case-study-postgres\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>For Postgres, we use the excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/jackc/pgx\"><u>jackc/pgx</u></a> driver, but instead of using the database/sql Scan interface, we directly receive the raw bytes for each row and use the jackc/pgx internal scan functions for each Postgres OID (Object Identifier) type.</p><p>The database/sql Scan interface in Go uses reflection to understand the type passed to the function and then also uses reflection to set each field with the column value received from Postgres. In typical scenarios, this is fast enough and easy to use, but falls short for our use cases in terms of performance. The <a href=\"https://github.com/jackc/pgx\"><u>jackc/pgx</u></a> driver reuses the row bytes produced each time the next Postgres row is requested, resulting in zero allocations per row. This allows us to write high-performance, low-allocation code within Jetflow. With this design, we are able to achieve nearly <b>600,000 rows per second</b> per Postgres connection for most tables, with very low memory usage.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n      <a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>As of early July 2025, the team ingests <b>77 billion</b> records per day via <b>Jetflow</b>.

The framework has allowed us to ingest tables in cases that would not otherwise have been possible, and provided significant cost savings due to ingestions running for less time and with fewer resources. </p><p>In the future, we plan to open source the project, and if you are interested in joining our team to help develop tools like this, then open roles can be found at <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/careers/jobs/\"><u>https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/</u></a>.</p>",
