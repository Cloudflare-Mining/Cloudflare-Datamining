They are similar to car gridlocks that jam roads, preventing drivers from getting to their destination.</p><p>There are three main types of DDoS attacks that we will cover in this report. The first is an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/\">HTTP request</a> intensive DDoS attack that aims to overwhelm HTTP servers with more requests than they can handle to cause a denial of service event. The second is an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/\">IP packet</a> intensive DDoS attack that aims to overwhelm in-line appliances such as routers, firewalls, and servers with more packets than they can handle. The third is a bit-intensive attack that aims to saturate and clog the Internet link causing that ‘gridlock’ that we discussed. In this report, we will highlight various techniques and insights on all three types of attacks.</p><p>Previous editions of the report can be found <a href=\"/tag/ddos-reports\">here</a>, and are also available on our interactive hub, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports?q=DDoS\">Cloudflare Radar</a>.

While the Cryptocurrency sector was initially leading in terms of the volume of HTTP DDoS attack requests, a new target emerged as a primary victim. The Environmental Services industry experienced an unprecedented surge in HTTP DDoS attacks, with these attacks constituting half of all its HTTP traffic. This marked a staggering 618-fold increase compared to the previous year, highlighting a disturbing trend in the cyber threat landscape.</p><p>This surge in cyber attacks coincided with COP 28, which ran from November 30th to December 12th, 2023. The conference was a pivotal event, signaling what many considered the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/cop28-agreement-signals-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-fossil-fuel-era\">&#39;beginning of the end&#39; for the fossil fuel era</a>. It was observed that in the period leading up to COP 28, there was a noticeable spike in HTTP attacks targeting Environmental Services websites. This pattern wasn&#39;t isolated to this event alone.</p><p>Looking back at historical data, particularly during COP 26 and COP 27, as well as other UN environment-related resolutions or announcements, a similar pattern emerges. Each of these events was accompanied by a corresponding increase in cyber attacks aimed at Environmental Services websites.</p><p>In February and March 2023, significant environmental events like the UN&#39;s resolution on <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/un-resolution-billed-turning-point-climate-justice\">climate justice</a> and the launch of United Nations Environment Programme’s <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/largest-river-and-wetland-restoration-initiative-history-launched-un\">Freshwater Challenge</a> potentially heightened the profile of environmental websites, possibly correlating with an increase in attacks on these sites​​​​.</p><p>This recurring pattern underscores the growing intersection between environmental issues and cyber security, a nexus that is increasingly becoming a focal point for attackers in the digital age.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"ddos-attacks-and-iron-swords\">DDoS attacks and Iron Swords</h2>\n            <a href=\"#ddos-attacks-and-iron-swords\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>It’s not just UN resolutions that trigger DDoS attacks.

That attack occurred in 2020, and we have yet to see anything larger.</p><p>This more recent attack, though, was unique in its bits per second rate. This was the largest network-layer DDoS attack we’ve seen in Q4. It peaked at 1.9 terabits per second and originated from a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/\">Mirai botnet</a>. It was a multi-vector attack, meaning it combined multiple attack methods. Some of those methods included UDP fragments flood, UDP/Echo flood, SYN Flood, ACK Flood, and TCP malformed flags.</p><p>This attack targeted a known European Cloud Provider and originated from over 18 thousand unique IP addresses that are assumed to be <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing/\">spoofed</a>. It was automatically detected and mitigated by Cloudflare’s defenses.</p><p>This goes to show that even the largest attacks end very quickly.

DNS is like a phone book for the Internet, translating human-friendly domain names like &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com\">www.cloudflare.com</a>&quot; into numerical IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.</p><p>Simply put, DNS-based DDoS attacks comprise the method computers and servers used to identify one another to cause an outage or disruption, without actually ‘taking down’ a server. For example, a server may be up and running, but the DNS server is down. So clients won&#39;t be able to connect to it and will experience it as an outage.</p><p>A <b>DNS flood</b> attack bombards a DNS server with an overwhelming number of DNS queries. This is usually done using a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-botnet/\">DDoS botnet</a>. The sheer volume of queries can overwhelm the DNS server, making it difficult or impossible for it to respond to legitimate queries. This can result in the aforementioned service disruptions, delays or even an outage for those trying to access the websites or services that rely on the targeted DNS server.</p><p>On the other hand, a <b>DNS amplification</b> attack involves sending a small query with a spoofed IP address (the address of the victim) to a DNS server. The trick here is that the DNS response is significantly larger than the request. The server then sends this large response to the victim&#39;s IP address. By exploiting open DNS resolvers, the attacker can amplify the volume of traffic sent to the victim, leading to a much more significant impact. This type of attack not only disrupts the victim but also can congest entire networks.</p><p>In both cases, the attacks exploit the critical role of DNS in network operations. Mitigation strategies typically include securing DNS servers against misuse, implementing rate limiting to manage traffic, and filtering DNS traffic to identify and block malicious requests.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5UolIGOVG2jx7ST3CeoF0j/438c133b8f875ce32238c480d580aaba/pasted-image-0--18--1.png\" alt=\"Top attack vectors\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"934\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Top attack vectors</p><p>Amongst the emerging threats we track, we recorded a 1,161% increase in ACK-RST Floods as well as a 515% increase in CLDAP floods, and a 243% increase in SPSS floods, in each case as compared to last quarter.

Because it uses UDP, there’s no handshake requirement which allows attackers to spoof the IP address thus allowing attackers to exploit it as a reflection vector.
