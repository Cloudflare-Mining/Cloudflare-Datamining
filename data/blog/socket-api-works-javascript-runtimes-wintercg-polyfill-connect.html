	<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-tcp-socket-api-connect-databases">announced a new API for creating outbound TCP sockets</a> — <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets?cf_target_id=6F3FD2F2360D5526EEE56A7398DB7D9D">connect()</a>. From day one, we’ve been working with the <a href="https://wintercg.org">Web-interoperable Runtimes Community Group (WinterCG) community</a> to chart a course toward making this API a standard, available across all runtimes and platforms — including Node.js.</p>
	<p>Today, we’re sharing that we’ve reached a new milestone in the path to making this API available across runtimes — engineers from Cloudflare and Vercel have published <a href="https://sockets-api.proposal.wintercg.org">a draft specification of the connect() sockets API</a> for review by the community, along with a Node.js compatible <a href="https://github.com/Ethan-Arrowood/socket">implementation of the connect() API</a> that developers can start using today.</p>
	<p>This implementation helps both application developers and maintainers of libraries and frameworks:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Maintainers of existing libraries that use the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/net.html">node:net</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html">node:tls</a> APIs can use it to more easily add support for runtimes where node:net and node:tls are not available.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>JavaScript frameworks can use it to make connect() available in local development, making it easier for application developers to target runtimes that provide connect().</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Why create a new standard? Why connect()?</h3>
	<p>As we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-tcp-socket-api-connect-databases">described when we first announced connect()</a>, to-date there has not been a standard API across JavaScript runtimes for creating and working with TCP or UDP sockets. This makes it harder for maintainers of open-source libraries to ensure compatibility across runtimes, and ultimately creates friction for application developers who have to navigate which libraries work on which platforms.</p>
	<p>While Node.js provides the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/net.html">node:net</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html">node:tls</a> APIs, these APIs were designed over 10 years ago in the very early days of the Node.js project and remain callback-based. As a result, they can be hard to work with, and expose configuration in ways that don’t fit serverless platforms or web browsers.</p>
	<p>The connect() API fills this gap by incorporating the best parts of existing socket APIs and <a href="https://github.com/WICG/direct-sockets/blob/main/docs/explainer.md">prior proposed standards</a>, based on feedback from the JavaScript community — including contributors to Node.js. Libraries like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg">pg</a> (<a href="https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres">node-postgres</a> on Github) are already using the connect() API.</p>
	<h3>The connect() specification</h3>
	<p>At time of writing, the <a href="https://sockets-api.proposal.wintercg.org">draft specification of the Sockets API</a> defines the following API:</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">dictionary SocketAddress {
  DOMString hostname;
  unsigned short port;
};

typedef (DOMString or SocketAddress) AnySocketAddress;

enum SecureTransportKind { "off", "on", "starttls" };

[Exposed=*]
dictionary SocketOptions {
  SecureTransportKind secureTransport = "off";
  boolean allowHalfOpen = false;
};

[Exposed=*]
interface Connect {
  Socket connect(AnySocketAddress address, optional SocketOptions opts);
};

interface Socket {
  readonly attribute ReadableStream readable;
  readonly attribute WritableStream writable;

  readonly attribute Promise&lt;undefined&gt; closed;
  Promise&lt;undefined&gt; close();

  Socket startTls();
};</code></pre>
	<p>The proposed API is Promise-based and reuses existing standards whenever possible. For example, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream">ReadableStream</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStream">WritableStream</a> are used for the read and write ends of the socket. This makes it easy to pipe data from a TCP socket to any other library or existing code that accepts a ReadableStream as input, or to write to a TCP socket via a WritableStream.</p>
	<p>The entrypoint of the API is the connect() function, which takes a string containing both the hostname and port separated by a colon, or an object with discrete hostname and port fields. It returns a Socket object which represents a socket connection. An instance of this object exposes attributes and methods for working with the connection.</p>
	<p>A connection can be established in plain-text or TLS mode, as well as a special “starttls” mode which allows the socket to be easily upgraded to TLS after some period of plain-text data transfer, by calling the startTls() method on the Socket object. No need to create a new socket or switch to using a separate set of APIs once the socket is upgraded to use TLS.</p>
	<p>For example, to upgrade a socket using the startTLS pattern, you might do something like this:</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">import { connect } from "@arrowood.dev/socket"

const options = { secureTransport: "starttls" };
const socket = connect("address:port", options);
const secureSocket = socket.startTls();
// The socket is immediately writable
// Relies on web standard WritableStream
const writer = secureSocket.writable.getWriter();
const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const encoded = encoder.encode("hello");
await writer.write(encoded);</code></pre>
	<p>Equivalent code using the node:net and node:tls APIs:</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">import net from 'node:net'
import tls from 'node:tls'

const socket = new net.Socket(HOST, PORT);
socket.once('connect', () =&gt; {
  const options = { socket };
  const secureSocket = tls.connect(options, () =&gt; {
    // The socket can only be written to once the
    // connection is established.
    // Polymorphic API, uses Node.js streams
    secureSocket.write('hello');
  }
})</code></pre>
	<h3>Use the Node.js implementation of connect() in your library</h3>
	<p>To make it easier for open-source library maintainers to adopt the connect() API, we’ve published an <a href="https://github.com/Ethan-Arrowood/socket">implementation of connect() in Node.js</a> that allows you to publish your library such that it works across JavaScript runtimes, without having to maintain any runtime-specific code.</p>
	<p>To get started, install it as a dependency:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">npm install --save @arrowood.dev/socket</code></pre>
	<p>And import it in your library or application:</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">import { connect } from "@arrowood.dev/socket"</code></pre>
	<h3>What’s next for connect()?</h3>
	<p>The <a href="https://github.com/wintercg/proposal-sockets-api">wintercg/proposal-sockets-api</a> is published as a draft, and the next step is to solicit and incorporate feedback. We’d love your feedback, particularly if you maintain an open-source library or make direct use of the node:net or node:tls APIs.</p>
	<p>Once feedback has been incorporated, engineers from Cloudflare, Vercel and beyond will be continuing to work towards contributing an implementation of the API directly to Node.js as a built-in API.</p>
