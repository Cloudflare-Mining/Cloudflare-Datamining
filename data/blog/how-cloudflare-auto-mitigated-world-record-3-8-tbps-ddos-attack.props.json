In the case of regular (non-attack) traffic, a <i>legitimate</i> packet received by a service will cause that service to perform some action, and different actions require different amounts of CPU processing. However, before a packet is even delivered to a service there is per-packet work that needs to be done. Layer 3 packet headers need to be parsed and processed to deliver the packet to the correct machine and interface. Layer 4 packet headers need to be processed and routed to the correct socket (if any). There may be multiple additional processing steps that inspect every packet. Therefore, if an attacker sends at a high enough packet rate, then they can potentially saturate the available CPU resources, denying service to legitimate users.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3aBbNG4Fc7TY6MTugLl3BE/308cd3caef51dad79bd3095a7f9f15cd/BLOG-2586_6.png\" alt=\"BLOG-2586 6\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>To defend against high packet rate attacks, you need to be able to inspect and discard the bad packets using as few CPU cycles as possible, leaving enough CPU to process the good packets.

There are really only a few choices: you can get a bigger pipe, you can potentially find a way to move the good traffic to a new pipe that isn’t saturated, or you can hopefully ask the upstream side of the pipe to stop sending some or all of the data into the pipe.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"generating-ddos-attacks\">Generating DDoS attacks</h2>\n            <a href=\"#generating-ddos-attacks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>If we think about what this means from the attackers point of view you realize there are similar constraints. Just as it takes CPU cycles to receive a packet, it also takes CPU cycles to create a packet. If, for example, the cost to send and receive a packet were equal, then the attacker would need an equal amount of CPU power to generate the attack as we would need to defend against it. In most cases this is not true — there is a cost asymmetry, as the attacker is able to generate packets using fewer CPU cycles than it takes to receive those packets. However, it is worth noting that generating attacks is not free and can require a large amount of CPU power.</p><p>Saturating network bandwidth can be even more difficult for an attacker. Here the attacker needs to be able to output more bandwidth than the target service has allocated. They actually need to be able to exceed the capacity of the receiving service. This is so difficult that the most common way to achieve a network bandwidth attack is to use a reflection/amplification attack method, for example a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/\"><u>DNS Amplification attack</u></a>. These attacks allow the attacker to send a small packet to an intermediate service, and the intermediate service will send a large packet to the victim.</p><p>In both scenarios, the attacker needs to acquire or gain access to many devices to generate the attack. These devices can be acquired in a number of different ways. They may be server class machines from cloud providers or hosting services, or they can be compromised devices like DVRs, routers, and webcams that have been infected with the attacker’s malware. These machines together form the botnet.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"how-cloudflare-defends-against-large-attacks\">How Cloudflare defends against large attacks</h2>\n            <a href=\"#how-cloudflare-defends-against-large-attacks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Now that we understand the fundamentals of how DDoS attacks work, we can explain how Cloudflare can defend against these attacks.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"spreading-the-attack-surface-using-global-anycast\">Spreading the attack surface using global anycast</h3>\n            <a href=\"#spreading-the-attack-surface-using-global-anycast\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The first not-so-secret ingredient is that Cloudflare’s network is built on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/\"><u>anycast</u></a>. In brief, anycast allows a single IP address to be advertised by multiple machines around the world. A packet sent to that IP address will be served by the closest machine. This means when an attacker uses their distributed botnet to launch an attack, the attack will be received in a distributed manner across the Cloudflare network. An infected DVR in Dallas, Texas will send packets to a Cloudflare server in Dallas. An infected webcam in London will send packets to a Cloudflare server in London.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/48tW6A6ACUT4Fd9h3l70F4/10edd30519e57cd679fa04c2ac6d170d/BLOG-2586_8.png\" alt=\"BLOG-2586 8\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1880\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Anycast vs. Unicast networks</i></sup></p><p>Our anycast network additionally allows Cloudflare to allocate compute and bandwidth resources closest to the regions that need them the most. Densely populated regions will generate larger amounts of legitimate traffic, and the data centers placed in those regions will have more bandwidth and CPU resources to meet those needs. Sparsely populated regions will naturally generate less legitimate traffic, so Cloudflare data centers in those regions can be sized appropriately. Since attack traffic is mainly coming from compromised devices, those devices will tend to be distributed in a manner that matches normal traffic flows sending the attack traffic proportionally to datacenters that can handle it. And similarly, within the datacenter, traffic is distributed across multiple machines.</p><p>Additionally, for high bandwidth attacks, Cloudflare’s network has another advantage. A large proportion of traffic on the Cloudflare network does not consume bandwidth in a symmetrical manner. For example, an HTTP request to get a webpage from a site behind Cloudflare will be a relatively small incoming packet, but produce a larger amount of outgoing traffic back to the client. This means that the Cloudflare network tends to egress far more legitimate traffic than we receive. However, the network links and bandwidth allocated are symmetrical, meaning there is an abundance of ingress bandwidth available to receive volumetric attack traffic.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"generating-real-time-signatures\">Generating real-time signatures</h3>\n            <a href=\"#generating-real-time-signatures\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>By the time you’ve reached an individual server inside a datacenter, the bandwidth of the attack has been distributed enough that none of the upstream links are saturated.

This enables us to execute custom code in kernel space and process (drop, forward, or modify) each packet directly at the network interface card (NIC) level. This component helps the system drop packets efficiently without consuming excessive CPU resources on the machine. </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1NUxGTvKFs5l6G2UCSxvqw/2c3868e417c6b5ade3d85d95eefd92cd/BLOG-2586_9.png\" alt=\"BLOG-2586 9\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1362\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Cloudflare DDoS protection system overview</i></sup></p><p>We use XDP to sample packets to look for suspicious attributes that indicate an attack. The samples include fields such as the source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol, TCP flags, sequence number, options, packet rate and more. This analysis is conducted by the <i>denial of service daemon (dosd).</i> <i>Dosd</i> holds our secret sauce. It has many <i>filters</i> which instruct it, based on our curated heuristics, when to initiate mitigation. To our customers, these filters are logically grouped by attack vectors and exposed as the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/\"><u>DDoS Managed Rules</u></a>. Our customers can <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/adjust-rules/\"><u>customize their behavior</u></a> to some extent, as needed.</p><p>As it receives samples from XDP, dosd will generate multiple permutations of fingerprints for suspicious traffic patterns. Then, using a data streaming algorithm, dosd will identify the most optimal fingerprints to mitigate the attack. Once an attack is qualified, dosd will push a mitigation rule inline as an eBPF program to surgically drop the attack traffic. </p><p>The detection and mitigation of attacks by dosd is done at the server level, at the data center level and at the global level — and it’s all software defined. This makes our network extremely resilient and leads to almost instant mitigation. There are no out-of-path “scrubbing centers” or “scrubbing devices”. Instead, each server runs the full stack of the Cloudflare product suite including the DDoS detection and mitigation component. And it is all done autonomously. Each server also <i>gossips (multicasts)</i> mitigation instructions within a data center between servers, and globally between data centers. This ensures that whether an attack is localized or globally distributed, dosd will have already installed mitigation rules inline to ensure a robust mitigation.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"strong-defenses-against-strong-attacks\">Strong defenses against strong attacks</h2>\n            <a href=\"#strong-defenses-against-strong-attacks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Our software-defined, autonomous DDoS detection and mitigation systems run across our entire network.
