For a break from project work and a time to socialize, interns looked forward to Virtual Intern Game Days and Gatheround meetups. These designated online hangout blocks made for a more fun and inclusive experience for the remote interns. Along with that, remote interns near Cloudflare offices were welcome to join in-person events throughout the summer: from team lunches to arts &amp; crafts and social mixers, visiting the office is always worth the trip!</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4d8Iy9W5w0Yr0ZsDv6ZhqQ/498f55d7b8fae94d32b1022cd2fd9788/2494-8.png\" alt=\"2494-8\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1128\" height=\"819\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sub>Group photo of a Gatherround session with the interns and Cloudfriends.</sub></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"executive-chats\">Executive chats</h4>\n      <a href=\"#executive-chats\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Executive chats have been a key part of ensuring our interns get to truly know our top leaders and ask them questions 1-on-1.

I had heard the story of Lee Holloway before, but hearing it from Matthew himself was really impactful.” </p><p><b>Chantal</b> loved the talk with <b>Michele Yetman</b>, Chief People Officer: “I enjoyed hearing about her job history and how she carefully adapted skill sets from her previous jobs to craft her career. Also, she was curious to hear our perspective and answered our questions in honest detail.”</p><p><b>Anantharaman </b>liked the talk with <b>Dane Knecht</b>, SVP of Emerging Technology and Innovation: “Learning about the growth of ETI, the Austin office and the mission to move fast and break things within ETI to nurture a startup-y culture was very interesting.”</p><p><b>Matilde</b> valued the talk with <b>Nitin Rao</b>, Interim Chief Product Officer: “I didn&#39;t know much about him beforehand, but I found it fascinating to learn about his role at the company and the great impact of his contributions to Cloudflare&#39;s current infrastructure.”</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"company-wide-intern-presentations\">Company-wide intern presentations</h4>\n      <a href=\"#company-wide-intern-presentations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Each summer, Cloudflare Intern-ets have the opportunity to showcase their work during the annual Intern Presentations series.
