In 2018 we’ve all been extremely busy helping Cloudflare &amp; our customers and therefore we left it <em>very</em> late this year. Uncomfortably late.</p>\n<p>If you want to know the best mince pie to buy in 2018 right now, skip straight to the bottom of this post where we reveal the winner. If you want to understand more about what makes a mince pie great and how we can learn this at Cloudflare’s scale - read on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoyoureview42varietiesofmincepieinanhour\">How do you review 42 varieties of mince pie in an hour?</h2>\n<p>With a very short amount of time to get this research out to a discerning and demanding public, we engaged the entire Cloudflare London team to help. Team members diligently went out and purchased mince pies from all over the South East of England for everyone to taste.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/mince_pie_collecting_collage.png\" alt=\"Mince pie collecting collage\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>On Monday the team assembled for a “Mince Pie Jam”, where we would taste &amp; consistently review each pie:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/2018_mince_pie_jam_kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"The 2018 Cloudflare Mince Pie Jam\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"aquickrefresherwhatisamincepie\">A quick refresher - what is a mince pie?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/internet_search_mince_pies.png\" alt=\"Internet search for Mince Pies\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>As we can see from even the most cursory Internet search, there’s a lot of questions surrounding mince pies. After some confusion relating to our 2017 edition of the IMDB we should clearly state: modern mince pies do not contain meat. A Mince Pie is “a sweet pie of British origin, filled with a mixture of dried fruits and spices called mincemeat, that is traditionally served during the Christmas season in the English world.” - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mince_pie\">Wikipedia for Mince Pie</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2017/12/mincepie-Sketch--Today-at-14.07.04.png\" alt=\"A cross-section drawing of a classic mince pie\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"ourmethodology\">Our methodology</h2>\n<p>We reviewed the mince pies in terms of its characteristics as well as overall. Each mince pie was given a score of 1 to 10 for each of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Innovation</li>\n<li>Booziness</li>\n<li>Pastry to Filling Ratio</li>\n<li>Pastry</li>\n<li>Mince</li>\n<li>Overall rating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The top 3 categories there are somewhat objective measurements compared to the more subjective ones below. During analysis, this created some exciting opportunities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"analysis\">Analysis</h2>\n<p>With this combination of 3 subjective &amp; 3 objective metrics and a total of 214 submitted reviews by our team, we had a lot of data. To break this data down Nela quickly settled on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).</p>\n<h3 id=\"thepearsoncorrelationcoefficient\">The Pearson Correlation Coefficient</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a> describes the PCC as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f76ccfa7c2ed7f5b085115086107bbe25d329cec\" alt=\"formula for the population Pearson Correlation Coefficient\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The correlation coefficient ranges from −1 to 1. A value of 1 implies that a linear equation describes the relationship between X and Y perfectly, with all data points lying on a line for which Y increases as X increases. A value of −1 implies that all data points lie on a line for which Y decreases as X increases. A value of 0 implies that there is no linear correlation between the variables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By setting our X Value as the Overall Rating, we were able to plug in each of the other metrics from our reviews as the Y value, to understand how important each of these characteristics are in producing a high quality result.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/2018_mince_pie_correlation_coefficient-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>2018 Internet Mince pie Database evaluation criteria coefficient. <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/nela7296#!/vizhome/2018MincePieRatingCriteria/RatingCriteriaCoefficient\">Explore the full dataset</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>From this data we can conclude that satisfaction with a pie’s mince filling is the most likely criteria for overall pie satisfaction with <code>r=.841</code>, while innovation creates a negative correlation implying that traditional mince pies are favoured, and straying from this will only lead to dissatisfaction. Alcohol content had a minor positive correlation while pastry, pastry to filling ratio, and aesthetic had an average positive correlation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wordassociation\">Word Association</h3>\n<p>Along with scores, our reviewers also left tasting notes which gave an insight into how they arrived at their scores. Taking the reviews which scored a mince pie from 1-5 we’re able to see the terms most associated with poorer performing pies:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/bad_mince_pie_review_word_cloud.png\" alt=\"Bad mince pie review word cloud\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Pies scoring between 6 and 10 points had the following terms used the most in tasting notes:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/good_mince_pie_review_word_cloud.png\" alt=\"Good mince pie review word cloud\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"alsoransandnotablementions\">Also-rans and notable mentions</h2>\n<p>Before we get to the final overall rankings, there’s a few categories we wanted to mention.</p>\n<h3 id=\"themostexpensivepies\">The Most Expensive Pies</h3>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, some of the most expensive mince pies come from London’s fanciest Restaurants &amp; Bakeries. The 3 most expensive mince pies did not rank highly enough to feature elsewhere - which goes to show you that money doesn’t necessarily buy you the best mince pie.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ottolenghimincepie\"><a href=\"https://ottolenghi.co.uk/\">Ottolenghi</a> Mince Pie</h4>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Overall</td>\n            <td>Price</td>\n            <td>Booziness</td>\n            <td>Aesthetic</td>\n            <td>Pastry-to-Filling Ratio</td>\n            <td>Innovation</td>\n            <td>Pastry</td>\n            <td>Filling</td>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>6.647</td>\n            <td>£10 for 4 (250ppp)</td>\n            <td>8.176</td>\n            <td>8.471</td>\n            <td>7.647</td>\n            <td>4.000</td>\n            <td>6.588</td>\n            <td>6.059</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Dickensian-styled thing of beauty, I expected a pie-seller to appear muttering &quot;gawd blimey guv'nor thems good pies&quot;.
