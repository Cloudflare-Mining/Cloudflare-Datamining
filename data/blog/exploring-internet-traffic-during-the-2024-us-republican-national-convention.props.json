With that said, notable trends can often be observed, and we’ve seen before how specific geopolitical events can trigger online attacks. For example, we saw cyberattacks at the start of the <a href=\"/one-year-of-war-in-ukraine\">war in Ukraine</a> to more <a href=\"/dutch-political-websites-hit-by-cyber-attacks-as-eu-voting-starts\">recently in the Netherlands</a>, when the June 2024 European elections coincided with cyberattacks on Dutch political-related websites that lasted two days — June 5th and 6th. The main DDoS (<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\">Distributed Denial of Service attack</a>) attack on June 5, the day before the Dutch election, reached 73,000 requests per second (rps).</p><p>Shifting our focus to the United States in particular, in the weeks since April 2024, we’ve seen several DDoS attacks targeting both federal and state government and political-related websites in the United States. In recent days Cloudflare has also blocked DDoS attacks targeting two political-related websites.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3hDTUPDdqg9h211ZAH1ACm/97a734072e91d581b17e260251ca3807/unnamed--1--6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"887\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>One of those is related to a political campaign, represented by the yellow line on the chart below.
