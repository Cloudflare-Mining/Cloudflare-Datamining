With that said, notable trends can often be observed, and we’ve seen before how specific geopolitical events can trigger online attacks. For example, we saw cyberattacks at the start of the <a href=\"/one-year-of-war-in-ukraine\">war in Ukraine</a> to more <a href=\"/dutch-political-websites-hit-by-cyber-attacks-as-eu-voting-starts\">recently in the Netherlands</a>, when the June 2024 European elections coincided with cyberattacks on Dutch political-related websites that lasted two days — June 5th and 6th. The main DDoS (<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\">Distributed Denial of Service attack</a>) attack on June 5, the day before the Dutch election, reached 73,000 requests per second (rps).</p><p>Shifting our focus to the United States in particular, in the weeks since April 2024, we’ve seen several DDoS attacks targeting both federal and state government and political-related websites in the United States. In recent days Cloudflare has also blocked DDoS attacks targeting two political-related websites.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3hDTUPDdqg9h211ZAH1ACm/97a734072e91d581b17e260251ca3807/unnamed--1--6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"887\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>One of those is related to a political campaign, represented by the yellow line on the chart below. The first spike was a DDoS attack on July 2, 2024, peaking at 56,000 rps and lasting around 10 minutes. The same political-related site was attacked later on July 14, with a 34,000 rps peak, lasting four minutes.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5jHkOfpp03Y2u1IiMXSMjt/e79c60ea259c5e1bb39d79b1806dadc1/unnamed-15.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"577\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The other political-related site under attack, in green on the previous chart, is a think tank website that does policy advocacy related to presidential politics. It was already attacked before, around the time of the Biden vs Trump debate, as we’ve published at the time in a <a href=\"/how-the-first-2024-us-presidential-debate-influenced-internet-traffic-and-security-trends\">related blog post</a>. The main attack was on July 11, with a 137,000 rps peak, lasting a few minutes, and was repeated, with slightly lower intensity, a few hours later on July 12.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/suW2ypFdXlSNlqNae05c8/df3bdfd8909ede83db8b10cff1da14f0/unnamed--2--5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"579\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As we’ve seen in our recent <a href=\"/ddos-threat-report-for-2024-q2\">DDoS report</a>, the vast majority of DDoS attacks are short.
