The malicious traffic to my blog\nfrequently brought down my dedicated server, with a server load pushing\nup to 100 CPU. While my hosting company worked very hard to keep the\nserver online, even their 24/7 server monitoring only helped reduce the\ndowntime associated with malicious traffic.</p>\n<p>I was looking for help with my blog and was thinking about migrating my\nblog to a high-end secured web hosting company. Given the hassles of\nmigrating hosting providers - not to mention the fact that I would\nlikely be paying higher monthly fees for hosting - I was frantically\nlooking for an alternative that would help my site stay up when my\nserver went down. A friend of mine advised me that I should try\n<a href=\"http://cloudflare.com\">CloudFlare</a>, a relatively new service that could\nhelp mitigate problems with malicious traffic and other service outages.\nAfter doing a bit of research about CloudFlare on Google, I decided to\ncreate an account to see if that would help me with my problems.</p>\n<p>Setting up CloudFlare was an easy process, one that took about five\nminutes for me to switch my authoritative name servers over to\nCloudFlare, and switching over the name servers would be a far easier\ntask than migrating to a different hosting provider. If I wasn&apos;t happy\nwith CloudFlare, it would only take me a few minutes to switch the name\nservers back to my original registrar. Much to my surprise, my server\nload dropped rapidly and I was no longer seeing the effects of the\nattacks on my server.</p>\n<p>In addition to the free security protection that CloudFlare offers,\nCloudFlare also works like a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/) to cache\nyour website static content and speed up the page load time. I\npersonally decided to upgrade to the\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans.html\">Pro</a> account to take advantage\nof the more advanced security functions, which was important to me\nbecause of the frequent attacks, and because the more advanced caching\nwith the <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22263581-What-does-the-Website-Preloader-do-\">website preloader</a>\nhelps make my pages load even faster. </p>\n<p>My CloudFlare dashboard has revealed the following benefits to me as a\nblogger:</p>\n<p>-My page loads are approximately 73% faster (.38 seconds after\ninstalling CloudFlare, 1.43 seconds before installing CloudFlare).\nCloudFlare calculates the speed by sending the same request twice: once\nthrough the CloudFlare system, and once directly to your site, bypassing\nthe CloudFlare system)<br>\n-CloudFlare is saving me about 38% on my bandwidth costs.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend CloudFlare to any site that is suffering a high\nserver load or that has issues with malicious traffic. You can get\nstarted with a free CloudFlare account (yes, it is FREE!) to reduce\nserver load, increase page load time, and get protected! In a nutshell,\nif you need a free (or paid) service to protect your website and\nincrease site performance, try CloudFlare.</p>\n<p>Notes:\n- You can only modify your name servers settings if you own your own\ndomain name. <br>\n- You will have to switch your name servers to CloudFlare to get their\nprotection and CDN services.<br>\n- Doing a dig or checking whois would reflect CloudFlare&apos;s name servers.<br>\n- CloudFlare, much like any other rapidly growing startup, has had some\ngrowing pains and is not entirely problem free. But they always solve\nproblems promptly and are continuously improving the system. CloudFlare\nsupport has been highly responsive via both <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/help.html\">CloudFlare\nhelp</a> or\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/cloudflare\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>Disclosure: While I did receive a <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/inaugural-cloudflare-t-shirts\">CloudFlare\nt-shir</a>t\nshortly after subscribing to CloudFlare , I did not receive any\ncompensation to write this article.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"CloudFlare Guest Blog Post: Liew Cheon\nFong\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/liewcf-server-load.png\" title=\"CloudFlare Guest Blog Post: Liew Cheon Fong\"><noscript><img alt=\"CloudFlare Guest Blog Post: Liew Cheon\nFong\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/liewcf-server-load.png\" title=\"CloudFlare Guest Blog Post: Liew Cheon Fong\"></noscript></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
