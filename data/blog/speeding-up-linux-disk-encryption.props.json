Available techniques are tightly coupled with a <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Linux_Kernel/Storage\">typical OS storage stack</a>. A simplified version of the storage stack and encryption solutions can be found on the diagram below:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1IM596LYKyiKGoM8dQv0a2/459b3d6be1edf9328914470ed9eee925/storage-stack.png\" alt=\"storage-stack\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1510\" height=\"740\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>On the top of the stack are applications, which read and write data in files (or streams). The file system in the OS kernel keeps track of which blocks of the underlying block device belong to which files and translates these file reads and writes into block reads and writes, however the hardware specifics of the underlying storage device is abstracted away from the filesystem. Finally, the block subsystem actually passes the block reads and writes to the underlying hardware using appropriate device drivers.</p><p>The concept of the storage stack is actually similar to the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/\">well-known network OSI model</a>, where each layer has a more high-level view of the information and the implementation details of the lower layers are abstracted away from the upper layers. And, similar to the OSI model, one can apply encryption at different layers (think about <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/\">TLS</a> vs <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec\">IPsec</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-vpn/\">a VPN</a>).</p><p>For data at rest we can apply encryption either at the block layers (either in hardware or in software) or at the file level (either directly in applications or in the filesystem).</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"block-vs-file-encryption\">Block vs file encryption</h4>\n      <a href=\"#block-vs-file-encryption\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Generally, the higher in the stack we apply encryption, the more flexibility we have. With application level encryption the application maintainers can apply any encryption code they please to any particular data they need. The downside of this approach is they actually have to implement it themselves and encryption in general is not very developer-friendly: one has to know the ins and outs of a specific cryptographic algorithm, properly generate keys, nonces, IVs etc. Additionally, application level encryption does not leverage OS-level caching and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache\">Linux page cache</a> in particular: each time the application needs to use the data, it has to either decrypt it again, wasting CPU cycles, or implement its own decrypted “cache”, which introduces more complexity to the code.</p><p>File system level encryption makes data encryption transparent to applications, because the file system itself encrypts the data before passing it to the block subsystem, so files are encrypted regardless if the application has crypto support or not. Also, file systems can be configured to encrypt only a particular directory or have different keys for different files. This flexibility, however, comes at a cost of a more complex configuration. File system encryption is also considered less secure than block device encryption as only the contents of the files are encrypted. Files also have associated metadata, like file size, the number of files, the directory tree layout etc., which are still visible to a potential adversary.</p><p>Encryption down at the block layer (often referred to as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption\">disk encryption</a> or full disk encryption) also makes data encryption transparent to applications and even whole file systems. Unlike file system level encryption it encrypts all data on the disk including file metadata and even free space. It is less flexible though - one can only encrypt the whole disk with a single key, so there is no per-directory, per-file or per-user configuration. From the crypto perspective, not all cryptographic algorithms can be used as the block layer doesn&#39;t have a high-level overview of the data anymore, so it needs to process each block independently. Most <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Common_modes\">common algorithms require some sort of block chaining</a> to be secure, so are not applicable to disk encryption. Instead, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption_theory#Block_cipher-based_modes\">special modes were developed</a> just for this specific use-case.</p><p>So which layer to choose? As always, it depends... Application and file system level encryption are usually the preferred choice for client systems because of the flexibility. For example, each user on a multi-user desktop may want to encrypt their home directory with a key they own and leave some shared directories unencrypted. On the contrary, on server systems, managed by SaaS/PaaS/IaaS companies (including Cloudflare) the preferred choice is configuration simplicity and security - with full disk encryption enabled any data from any application is automatically encrypted with no exceptions or overrides. We believe that all data needs to be protected without sorting it into &quot;important&quot; vs &quot;not important&quot; buckets, so the selective flexibility the upper layers provide is not needed.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"hardware-vs-software-disk-encryption\">Hardware vs software disk encryption</h4>\n      <a href=\"#hardware-vs-software-disk-encryption\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>When encrypting data at the block layer it is possible to do it directly in the storage hardware, if the hardware <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-based_full_disk_encryption\">supports it</a>.

However, since most hardware firmware is proprietary, it does not receive as much attention and review from the security community.

Normally, LUKS stores the password-encrypted disk encryption key on the same disk as the data, but since we want to compare read/write performance between encrypted and unencrypted devices, we might accidentally overwrite the encrypted key during our benchmarking later.

Originally we expected <code>dm-crypt</code> to be a simple &quot;proxy&quot;, which just encrypts/decrypts data as it flows through the stack. Turns out <code>dm-crypt</code> does more than just encrypting memory buffers and a (simplified) IO traverse path diagram is presented below:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4UenGQJyEiOzxwISPhhGR1/bdeae8ae7c9d331f4ca4d1cc75bbfb15/dm-crypt.png\" alt=\"dm-crypt\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1610\" height=\"792\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When the file system issues a write request, <code>dm-crypt</code> does not process it immediately - instead it puts it into a <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/core-api/workqueue.html\">workqueue</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/0d81a3f29c0afb18ba2b1275dcccf21e0dd4da38/drivers/md/dm-crypt.c#L3124\">named &quot;kcryptd&quot;</a>. In a nutshell, a kernel workqueue just schedules some work (encryption in this case) to be performed at some later time, when it is more convenient.

However, modern Linux Crypto API <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/crypto/api-skcipher.html#symmetric-key-cipher-api\">is asynchronous</a> as well, so depending on which particular implementation your system will use, most likely it will not be processed immediately, but queued again for &quot;later time&quot;.

For example, there is a <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/presentation/plenz\">nice presentation from Google</a> about the relationship between queueing and tail latency.

Well, back in 2005 Crypto API <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2/Documentation/crypto/api-intro.txt\">was not asynchronous</a>, so this made perfect sense.</p><p>In 2006 <code>dm-crypt</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/23541d2d288cdb54f417ba1001dacc7f3ea10a97\">started to use</a> the &quot;kcryptd&quot; workqueue not only for encryption, but for submitting IO requests:</p><blockquote><p>This patch is designed to help dm-crypt comply with the new constraints imposed by the following patch in -mm: md-dm-reduce-stack-usage-with-stacked-block-devices.patch</p></blockquote><p>It seems the goal here was not to add more concurrency, but rather reduce kernel stack usage, which makes sense again as the kernel has a common stack across all the code, so it is a quite limited resource. It is worth noting, however, that the <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/6538b8ea886e472f4431db8ca1d60478f838d14b\">Linux kernel stack has been expanded</a> in 2014 for x86 platforms, so this might not be a problem anymore.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/cabf08e4d3d1181d7c408edae97fb4d1c31518af\">first version of &quot;kcryptd_io&quot; workqueue was added</a> in 2007 with the intent to avoid:</p><blockquote><p>starvation caused by many requests waiting for memory allocation...</p></blockquote><p>The request processing was bottlenecking on a single workqueue here, so the solution was to add another one. Makes sense.</p><p>We are definitely not the first ones experiencing performance degradation because of extensive queueing: in 2011 a change was introduced to <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/20c82538e4f5ede51bc2b4795bc6e5cae772796d\">conditionally revert some of the queueing for read requests</a>:</p><blockquote><p>If there is enough memory, code can directly submit bio instead queuing this operation in a separate thread.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, at that time Linux kernel commit messages were not as verbose as today, so there is no performance data available.</p><p>In 2015 <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/dc2676210c425ee8e5cb1bec5bc84d004ddf4179\">dm-crypt started to sort writes</a> in a separate &quot;dmcrypt_write&quot; thread before sending them down the stack:</p><blockquote><p>On a multiprocessor machine, encryption requests finish in a different order than they were submitted. Consequently, write requests would be submitted in a different order and it could cause severe performance degradation.</p></blockquote><p>It does make sense as sequential disk access used to be much faster than the random one and <code>dm-crypt</code> was breaking the pattern. But this mostly applies to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive\">spinning disks</a>, which were still dominant in 2015. It may not be as important with modern fast <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive\">SSDs (including NVME SSDs)</a>.</p><p>Another part of the commit message is worth mentioning:</p><blockquote><p>...in particular it enables IO schedulers like CFQ to sort more effectively...</p></blockquote><p>It mentions the performance benefits for the <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/block/cfq-iosched.txt\">CFQ IO scheduler</a>, but Linux schedulers have improved since then to the point that <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f382fb0bcef4c37dc049e9f6963e3baf204d815c\">CFQ scheduler has been removed</a> from the kernel in 2018.</p><p>The same patchset <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b3c5fd3052492f1b8d060799d4f18be5a5438\">replaces the sorting list with a red-black tree</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In theory the sorting should be performed by the underlying disk scheduler, however, in practice the disk scheduler only accepts and sorts a finite number of requests. To allow the sorting of all requests, dm-crypt needs to implement its own sorting.</p><p>The overhead associated with rbtree-based sorting is considered negligible so it is not used conditionally.</p></blockquote><p>All that make sense, but it would be nice to have some backing data.</p><p>Interestingly, in the same patchset we see <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0f5d8e6ee758f7023e4353cca75d785b2d4f6abe\">the introduction of our familiar &quot;submit_from_crypt_cpus&quot; option</a>:</p><blockquote><p>There are some situations where offloading write bios from the encryption threads to a single thread degrades performance significantly</p></blockquote><p>Overall, we can see that every change was reasonable and needed, however things have changed since then:</p><ul><li><p>hardware became faster and smarter</p></li><li><p>Linux resource allocation was revisited</p></li><li><p>coupled Linux subsystems were rearchitected</p></li></ul><p>And many of the design choices above may not be applicable to modern Linux.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-clean-up\">The &quot;clean-up&quot;</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-clean-up\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Based on the research above we decided to try to remove all the extra queueing and asynchronous behaviour and revert <code>dm-crypt</code> to its original purpose: simply encrypt/decrypt IO requests as they pass through.

Modern Linux Crypto API may also be asynchronous and for the sake of this experiment we want to eliminate queues there as well. What does &quot;may be&quot; mean, though? The OS may contain different implementations of the same algorithm (for example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set\">hardware-accelerated AES-NI on x86 platforms</a> and generic C-code AES implementations). By default the system chooses the &quot;best&quot; one based on <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/crypto/architecture.html#crypto-api-cipher-references-and-priority\">the configured algorithm priority</a>. <code>dm-crypt</code> allows overriding this behaviour and <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/wikis/DMCrypt#mapping-table-for-crypt-target\">request a particular cipher implementation</a> using the <code>capi:</code> prefix. However, there is one problem. Let us actually check the available AES-XTS (this is our disk encryption cipher, remember?) implementations on our system:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ grep -A 11 &#039;xts(aes)&#039; /proc/crypto\nname         : xts(aes)\ndriver       : xts(ecb(aes-generic))\nmodule       : kernel\npriority     : 100\nrefcnt       : 7\nselftest     : passed\ninternal     : no\ntype         : skcipher\nasync        : no\nblocksize    : 16\nmin keysize  : 32\nmax keysize  : 64\n--\nname         : __xts(aes)\ndriver       : cryptd(__xts-aes-aesni)\nmodule       : cryptd\npriority     : 451\nrefcnt       : 1\nselftest     : passed\ninternal     : yes\ntype         : skcipher\nasync        : yes\nblocksize    : 16\nmin keysize  : 32\nmax keysize  : 64\n--\nname         : xts(aes)\ndriver       : xts-aes-aesni\nmodule       : aesni_intel\npriority     : 401\nrefcnt       : 1\nselftest     : passed\ninternal     : no\ntype         : skcipher\nasync        : yes\nblocksize    : 16\nmin keysize  : 32\nmax keysize  : 64\n--\nname         : __xts(aes)\ndriver       : __xts-aes-aesni\nmodule       : aesni_intel\npriority     : 401\nrefcnt       : 7\nselftest     : passed\ninternal     : yes\ntype         : skcipher\nasync        : no\nblocksize    : 16\nmin keysize  : 32\nmax keysize  : 64</pre></code>\n            <p>We want to explicitly select a synchronous cipher from the above list to avoid queueing effects in threads, but the only two supported are <code>xts(ecb(aes-generic))</code> (the generic C implementation) and <code>__xts-aes-aesni</code> (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set\">x86 hardware-accelerated implementation</a>). We definitely want the latter as it is much faster (we&#39;re aiming for performance here), but it is suspiciously marked as internal (see <code>internal: yes</code>). If we <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/fb33c6510d5595144d585aa194d377cf74d31911/include/linux/crypto.h#L91\">check the source code</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Mark a cipher as a service implementation only usable by another cipher and never by a normal user of the kernel crypto API</p></blockquote><p>So this cipher is meant to be used only by other wrapper code in the Crypto API and not outside it. In practice this means, that the caller of the Crypto API needs to explicitly specify this flag, when requesting a particular cipher implementation, but <code>dm-crypt</code> does not do it, because by design it is not part of the Linux Crypto API, rather an &quot;external&quot; user. We already patch the <code>dm-crypt</code> module, so we could as well just add the relevant flag. However, there is another problem with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set\">AES-NI</a> in particular: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X87\">x86 FPU</a>. &quot;Floating point&quot; you say? Why do we need floating point math to do symmetric encryption which should only be about bit shifts and XOR operations? We don&#39;t need the math, but AES-NI instructions use some of the CPU registers, which are dedicated to the FPU. Unfortunately the Linux kernel <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/fb33c6510d5595144d585aa194d377cf74d31911/arch/x86/kernel/fpu/core.c#L77\">does not always preserve these registers in interrupt context</a> for performance reasons (saving/restoring FPU is expensive). But <code>dm-crypt</code> may execute code in interrupt context, so we risk corrupting some other process data and we go back to &quot;it would be very unwise to do decryption in an interrupt context&quot; statement in the original code.</p><p>Our solution to address the above was to create another somewhat <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/linux/blob/master/patches/0024-Add-xtsproxy-Crypto-API-module.patch\">&quot;smart&quot; Crypto API module</a>.

The green line is from a server with unencrypted disks, which we will use as baseline. The red line is from a server with encrypted disks with the default Linux disk encryption implementation and the blue line is from a server with encrypted disks and our optimisations enabled. As we can see the default Linux disk encryption implementation has a significant impact on our cache latency in worst case scenarios, whereas the patched implementation is indistinguishable from not using encryption at all. In other words the improved encryption implementation does not have any impact at all on our cache response speed, so we basically get it for free!

Also we <a href=\"/how-expensive-is-crypto-anyway/\">reconfirmed that modern cryptography is not expensive</a> and there is usually no excuse not to protect your data.</p><p>We are going to submit this work for inclusion in the main kernel source tree, but most likely not in its current form. Although the results look encouraging we have to remember that Linux is a highly portable operating system: it runs on powerful servers as well as small resource constrained IoT devices and on <a href=\"/arm-takes-wing/\">many other CPU architectures</a> as well. The current version of the patches just optimises disk encryption for a particular workload on a particular architecture, but Linux needs a solution which runs smoothly everywhere.</p><p>That said, if you think your case is similar and you want to take advantage of the performance improvements now, you may <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/linux/blob/master/patches/\">grab the patches</a> and hopefully provide feedback. The runtime flag makes it easy to toggle the functionality on the fly and a simple A/B test may be performed to see if it benefits any particular case or setup. These patches have been running across our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">wide network of more than 200 data centres</a> on five generations of hardware, so can be reasonably considered stable.
