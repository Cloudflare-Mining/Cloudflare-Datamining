		"html": "<p>Cloudflare Access secures internal applications without the hassle, slowness or user headache of a corporate VPN. Access brings the experience we all cherish, of being able to access web sites anywhere, any time from any device, to the sometimes dreary world of corporate applications. Teams can integrate the single sign-on (SSO) option, like Okta or AzureAD, that they’ve chosen to use and in doing so make on-premise or self-managed cloud applications feel like SaaS apps.</p><p>However, teams consist of more than just the internal employees that share an identity provider. Organizations work with partners, freelancers, and contractors. Extending access to external users becomes a constant chore for IT and security departments and is a source of security problems.</p><p>Cloudflare Access removes that friction by simultaneously integrating with multiple identity providers, including popular services like Gmail or GitHub that do not require corporate subscriptions. External users login with these accounts and still benefit from the same ease-of-use available to internal employees. Meanwhile, administrators avoid the burden in legacy deployments that require onboarding and offboarding new accounts for each project.</p><p>We are excited to announce two new integrations that make it even easier for organizations to work securely with third parties.

When contractors join a project, the IT department receives help desk tickets to create new user accounts in the organization directory. Contractors receive instructions on how to sign-up, they spend time creating passwords and learning the new tool, and then use those credentials to login.</p><p>This option gives an organization control of identity, but adds overhead in terms of time and cost. The project owner also needs to pay for new SSO seat licenses, even if those seats are temporary. The IT department must spend time onboarding, helping, and then offboarding those user accounts. And the users themselves need to learn a new system and manage yet another password - this one with permission to your internal resources.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2ehj44dRmO4l4iCBUZ64GV/cf1f2dcdb01bd99b912a975900148dec/onboard-overload-_2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2052\" height=\"1908\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Alternatively, other groups decide to “federate” identity. In this flow, an organization will connect their own directory service to their partner’s equivalent service. External users login with their own credentials, but administrators do the work to merge the two services to trust one another.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6GeghsR5LjsPpSBmI026tu/9b69cd8ff7c9b7ceb833e7eb693be9e3/plug-this-into-that-_2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"3266\" height=\"1809\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>While this method avoids introducing new passwords, both organizations need to agree to dedicate time to integrate their identity providers - assuming that those providers can integrate. Businesses then need to configure this setup with each contractor or partner group. This model also requires that external users be part of a larger organization, making it unavailable to single users or freelancers.</p><p>Both options must also address scoping. If a contractor joins a project, they probably only need access to a handful of applications - not the entire portfolio of internal tools. Administrators need to invest additional time building rules that limit the scope of user permission.</p><p>Additionally, teams need to help guide external users to find the applications they need to do their work. This typically ends up becoming a one-off email that the IT staff has to send to each new user.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"multi-sso-with-cloudflare-access\">Multi-SSO with Cloudflare Access</h2>\n            <a href=\"#multi-sso-with-cloudflare-access\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare Access replaces corporate VPNs with Cloudflare’s network. Instead of placing internal tools on a private network, teams deploy them in any environment, including hybrid or multi-cloud models, and secure them consistently with Cloudflare’s network.</p><p>Administrators build rules to decide who should be able to reach the tools protected by Access. In turn, when users need to connect to those tools, they are prompted to authenticate with their team’s identity provider. Cloudflare Access checks their login against the list of allowed users and, if permitted, allows the request to proceed.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/fuVikI9ANFUHPUhlxqTM4/4632b3058aa0b43bbe609d5166d9fddd/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1334\" height=\"844\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>With Multi-SSO, this model works the same way but extends that login flow to other sign-in options. When users visit a protected application, they are presented with the identity provider options your team configures. They select their SSO, authenticate, and are redirected to the resource if they are allowed to reach it.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/zNHUSccfcA4kIiJ78hS8G/6347e4fc8ff3213eb810383beffa5b51/multi-sso-login-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"400\" height=\"690\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Cloudflare Access can also help standardize identity across multiple providers. When users login, from any provider, Cloudflare Access generates a signed JSON Web Token that contains that user’s identity. That token can then be used to authorize the user to the application itself. Cloudflare has open sourced an example of using this token for authorization with our <a href=\"/cloudflare-access-sharing-our-single-sign-on-plugin-for-atlassian/\">Atlassian SSO plugin</a>.</p><p>Whether the identity providers use SAML, OIDC, or another protocol for sending identity to Cloudflare, Cloudflare Access generates standardized and consistent JWTs for each user from any provider. The token can then be used as a common source of identity for applications without additional layers of SSO configuration.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"onboard-contractors-seamlessly\">Onboard contractors seamlessly</h2>\n            <a href=\"#onboard-contractors-seamlessly\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>With the Multi-SSO feature in Cloudflare Access, teams can onboard contractors in less than a minute without paying for additional identity provider licenses.</p><p>Organizations can integrate LinkedIn, GitHub, or Google accounts like Gmail alongside their own corporate identity provider.
