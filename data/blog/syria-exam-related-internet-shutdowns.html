	<p>To prevent cheating in exams many countries restrict or <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/need-stop-shutting-internet-school-exams/" target="_blank">even shut down Internet access</a> during critical exam hours. For most of June Syria is having planned Internet shutdowns during critical exam periods. The exam schedule is as follows:</p>

	<p>I’m grateful to a <a href="https://twitter.com/YahiaSweid/status/1400483770738757633" target="_blank">Twitter user</a> for the translation from the <a href="http://moed.gov.sy/site/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1/%D8%A5%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA" target="_blank">original Arabic</a> and collating the data.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare Radar allows anyone to track Internet traffic patterns around the world, and it has country-specific pages. The chart for the last seven days of <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/sy?date_filter=last_7_days" target="_blank">Internet use in Syria</a> as seen by Cloudflare shows two drops to almost zero corresponding to the first two exams on the schedule.</p>

	<p>The Internet outage starts at around 0100 UTC (0400 local time) and ends about four and a half hours later at 0530 UTC (0830 UTC). This covers the period before the exams start apparently to prevent any figuring out the answers.</p>
