Let’s look at an example:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4XOfmXg6BcOIgiu251hBJD/eabf17479275344611960be1249e869e/image4.png\" alt=\"DNS records for mycoolwebpage.xyz\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"831\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When I do a DNS lookup for the IP address of <code>subdomain1.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code>, I get two IP addresses back, because I have added two A records on that subdomain:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ dig subdomain1.mycoolwebpage.xyz -t a +short\n192.0.2.1\n192.0.2.2</pre></code>\n            <p>I could specify the target of all subdomains like this, with one or multiple DNS records per subdomain. But what if I have hundreds or even thousands of subdomains that I all want to point to the same resource?</p><p>This is where a wildcard DNS record comes in. By using the asterisk symbol <code>&quot;*&quot;</code> in the <i>Name</i> field, I can create one or multiple DNS records that are used as the response for all subdomains <b>that are not specifically covered by another DNS record</b> (more on this later). So the wildcard record you can see in the screenshot above is covering <code>*.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code>, meaning all subdomains of <code>mycoolwebpage.xyz</code>. This can also be done on deeper levels, like on <code>*.www.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code>.</p><p>If I perform a lookup for <code>subdomain2.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code>, the target I specified in the wildcard record will be used as the response. Again, this is only happening because there is no DNS record specifically for this subdomain.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ dig subdomain2.mycoolwebpage.xyz -t a +short\n192.0.2.3</pre></code>\n            <p>And it is often overlooked that a wildcard record does not only cover the level it is set on directly, but deeper levels, as well:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ dig some.deep.label.subdomain2.mycoolwebpage.xyz -t a +short \n192.0.2.3</pre></code>\n            <p>Also, a wildcard DNS record does <b>not</b> cover the apex of the zone (in this example the apex is <code>mycoolwebpage.xyz</code>).</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"a-few-more-things-to-know-about-wildcard-records\">A few more things to know about wildcard records</h3>\n            <a href=\"#a-few-more-things-to-know-about-wildcard-records\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Below you can find additional rules that apply to wildcard DNS records you should be aware of:</p><p><b>Wildcards are only supported on the first label</b>. Meaning something like <code>subdomain.*.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code> is not a wildcard on the level of the asterisk character. If you create a DNS record with that name, the asterisk is interpreted as the literal character and not as the wildcard operator.</p><p><b>You cannot create wildcards on multiple levels</b>. So if you create a DNS record on <code>*.*.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code>, only the first asterisk is interpreted as a wildcard while the second one is interpreted as the literal <code>“*”</code> character.</p><p><b>Wildcards will be applied for multiple levels</b>. But a specific record on any equal or lower level will terminate anything on or below this specific record — independent of the type of that specific record. Here is an example. If you have <b>only</b> these two records on your domain</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">subdomain1.mycoolwebpage.xyz  TXT  “some text”\n*.mycoolwebpage.xyz  \tA  192.0.2.3</pre></code>\n            <p>the wildcard record will be used for queries going to any subdomain of <code>mycoolwebpage.xyz</code> <b>except</b> <code>subdomain1.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code> or anything <b>below</b> that specific label, like <code>deeper.label.subdomain1.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code> — simply because there already exists a record on <code>subdomain1.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code>. However, the wildcard will be used for deeper labels that are <b>not</b> below the specific record on subdomain1 — for example, <code>deeper.label.subdomain2.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code>.</p><p>To expand on this rule: if you think of DNS as a tree starting from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone\">root zone</a> (see the diagram below), simply the existence of a branch terminates the wildcard for <b>all records</b> on that branch. In the example above the wildcard was terminated for anything on the label subdomain1 <b>and below</b>, but even if there only exists a record on a deeper level, anything <b>above</b> will also be terminating the wildcard. This example should make it clear. If you <b>only</b> have the following two records on your domain, as shown in the diagram below</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">some.deep.label.subdomain1.mycoolwebpage.xyz  TXT  “some other text”\n*.mycoolwebpage.xyz  \tA  192.0.2.3</pre></code>\n            <p>a query to <code>label.subdomain1.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code> for an A record is <b>not</b> covered by the wildcard because it is a node on the existing branch ending in the TXT record above.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/30H8qRK0B7QqrPfuut8e9I/27aa8c864658658e48e311251e52babb/image3.png\" alt=\"DNS tree structure for mycoolwebpage.xyz\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1379\" height=\"1066\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Wildcard records only cover the record type they are specified for</b>. If you add a wildcard A record for <code>*.mycoolwebpage.xyz</code> it will not cover queries specifying AAAA records (or any other type). But as mentioned in the previous point, a record on a specific label will terminate the wildcard for this label and everything below even if it’s a different record type.</p><p>All the above and more can be found in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc4592/\">RFC4592</a>.

You can proxy DNS records of the type A, AAAA, and CNAME. These record types are used to specify the origin server of a hostname which expects traffic via HTTP/S.</p><p>Proxying a wildcard DNS record works exactly as proxying a specific record. In the Cloudflare dashboard, navigate to the DNS app and either create a new wildcard record or edit an existing record and toggle the proxy status to <i>Proxied</i>.
