With our new GraphQL Analytics API, all of your performance, security, and reliability data is available from one endpoint, and you can select exactly what you need, whether it’s one metric for one domain or multiple metrics aggregated for all of your domains. You can ask questions like <i>“How many cached bytes have been returned for these three domains?”</i> Or, <i>“How many requests have all the domains under my account received?”</i> Or even, <i>“What effect did changing my firewall rule an hour ago have on the responses my users were seeing?”</i></p><p>The GraphQL standard also has strong <a href=\"https://graphql.org/community/\">community resources</a>, from extensive documentation to front-end clients, making it easy to start creating simple queries and progress to building your own sophisticated analytics dashboards.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"from-many-apis\">From many APIs...</h3>\n      <a href=\"#from-many-apis\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Providing insights has always been a core part of Cloudflare’s offering. After all, by using Cloudflare, you’re relying on us for key parts of your infrastructure, and so we need to make sure you have the data to manage, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/app-performance-monitoring/\">monitor</a>, and troubleshoot your website, app, or service. Over time, we developed a few key data APIs, including ones providing information regarding your domain’s traffic, DNS queries, and firewall events. This multi-API approach was acceptable while we had only a few products, but we started to run into some challenges as we added more products and analytics. We couldn’t expect users to adopt a new analytics API every time they started using a new product. In fact, some of the customers and partners that were relying on many of our products were already becoming confused by the various APIs.</p><p>Following the multi-API approach was also affecting how quickly we could develop new analytics within the Cloudflare dashboard, which is used by more people for data exploration than our APIs. Each time we built a new product, our product engineering teams had to implement a corresponding analytics API, which our user interface engineering team then had to learn to use. This process could take up to several months for each new set of analytics dashboards.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"to-one\">...to one</h3>\n      <a href=\"#to-one\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Our new GraphQL Analytics API solves these problems by providing access to all Cloudflare analytics. It offers a standard, flexible syntax for describing exactly the data you need and provides predictable, matching responses. This approach makes it an ideal tool for:</p><ol><li><p>Data exploration. You can think of it as a way to query your own virtual data warehouse, full of metrics and logs regarding the performance, security, and reliability of your Internet property.</p></li><li><p>Building amazing dashboards, which allow for flexible filtering, sorting, and drilling down or rolling up. Creating these kinds of dashboards would normally require paying thousands of dollars for a specialized analytics tool. You get them as part of our product and can customize them for yourself using the API.</p></li></ol><p>In a companion post that was also published today, my colleague Nick discusses using the GraphQL Analytics API to build dashboards. So, in this post, I’ll focus on examples of how you can use the API to explore your data. To make the queries, I’ll be using <a href=\"https://electronjs.org/apps/graphiql\"><i>GraphiQL</i></a>, a popular open-source querying tool that takes advantage of GraphQL’s capabilities.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"introspection-what-data-is-available\">Introspection: what data is available?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#introspection-what-data-is-available\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The first thing you may be wondering: if the GraphQL Analytics API offers access to so much data, how do I figure out what exactly is available, and how I can ask for it? GraphQL makes this easy by offering “introspection,” meaning you can query the API itself to see the available data sets, the fields and their types, and the operations you can perform. <i>GraphiQL</i> uses this functionality to provide a “Documentation Explorer,” query auto-completion, and syntax validation. For example, here is how I can see all the data sets available for a zone (domain):</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6v9HqDr6UGaifduopecAMw/6f89f52d3ca080c7385710598bd8b26e/image1.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"640\" height=\"283\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>If I’m writing a query, and I’m interested in data on firewall events, auto-complete will help me quickly find relevant data sets and fields:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5RSkIKlSwBMy7BVZWPWp0q/c605fa07bb8997758e2e84cbb47406f9/image6.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"640\" height=\"181\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"querying-examples-of-questions-you-can-ask\">Querying: examples of questions you can ask</h3>\n      <a href=\"#querying-examples-of-questions-you-can-ask\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Let’s say you’ve made a major product announcement and expect a surge in requests to your blog, your application, and several other zones (domains) under your account. You can check if this surge materializes by asking for the requests aggregated under your account, in the 30 minutes after your announcement post, broken down by the minute:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\">{\n viewer { \n   accounts (filter: {accountTag: $accountTag}) {\n     httpRequests1mGroups(limit: 30, filter: {datetime_geq: &quot;2019-09-16T20:00:00Z&quot;, datetime_lt: &quot;2019-09-16T20:30:00Z&quot;}, orderBy: [datetimeMinute_ASC]) {\n\t  dimensions {\n\t\tdatetimeMinute\n\t  }\n\t  sum {\n\t\trequests\n\t  }\n\t}\n   }\n }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>Here is the first part of the response, showing requests for your account, by the minute:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7hsWUNy86iymsBlbiOfjL5/054c2bce4d1fef4090e56f264fee7aec/Screen-Shot-2019-09-17-at-2.21.41-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1120\" height=\"756\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Now, let’s say you want to compare the traffic coming to your blog versus your marketing site over the last hour.
