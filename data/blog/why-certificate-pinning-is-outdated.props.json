At Cloudflare, we stay close to industry changes to ensure that we can provide the best solutions to our customers. One practice that we’re continuing to see in use that no longer serves its original purpose is certificate pinning. In this post, we’ll dive into certificate pinning, the consequences of using it in today’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/\">Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</a> world, and alternatives to pinning that offer the same level of security without the management overhead.   </p><p>PKI exists to help issue and manage <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/\">TLS certificates</a>, which are vital to keeping the Internet secure – they ensure that users access the correct applications or servers and that data between two parties stays encrypted. The mis-issuance of a certificate can pose great risk. For example, if a malicious party is able to issue a TLS certificate for your bank’s website, then they can potentially impersonate your bank and intercept that traffic to get access to your bank account. To prevent a mis-issued certificate from intercepting traffic, the server can give a certificate to the client and say “only trust connections if you see this certificate and drop any responses that present a different certificate” – this practice is called certificate pinning. </p><p>In the early 2000s, it was common for banks and other organizations that handle sensitive data to pin certificates to clients. However, over the last 20 years, TLS certificate issuance has evolved and changed, and new solutions have been developed to help customers achieve the security benefit they receive through certificate pinning, with simpler management, and without the risk of disruption.</p><p>Cloudflare’s mission is to help build a better Internet, which is why our teams are always focused on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/domain-protection-services/\">keeping domains secure and online</a>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"why-certificate-pinning-is-causing-more-outages-now-than-it-did-before\">Why certificate pinning is causing more outages now than it did before</h2>\n      <a href=\"#why-certificate-pinning-is-causing-more-outages-now-than-it-did-before\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Certificate pinning is not a new practice, so why are we emphasizing the need to stop using it <i>now</i>? The reason is that the PKI ecosystem is moving towards becoming more agile, flexible, and secure. As a part of this change, <a href=\"https://www.ssl.com/article/what-is-a-certificate-authority-ca/\">certificate authorities (CAs)</a> are starting to rotate certificates and their intermediates, certificates that bridge the root certificate and the domain certificate, more frequently to improve security and encourage automation.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6bcPbw10tESD1qHK6cP9yE/ac3f3df18f10a8a4595386a49a7ecd07/image3-12.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"678\" height=\"738\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>These more frequent certificate rotations are problematic from a pinning perspective because certificate pinning relies on the exact matching of certificates. When a certificate is rotated, the new certificate might not match the pinned certificate on the client side. If the pinned certificate is not updated to reflect the contents of the rotated certificate, the client will reject the new certificate, even if it’s valid and issued by the same CA. This mismatch leads to a failure in establishing a secure connection, causing the domain or application to become inaccessible until the pinned certificate is updated.</p><p>Since the start of 2024, we have seen the number of customer reported outages caused by certificate pinning significantly increase. (As of this writing, we are part way through July and Q3 has already seen as many outages as the last three quarters of 2023 combined.)</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1U4AFw29oL1GCcen93rnYr/5dea495d82170011725de472cfd7f98a/image4-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We can attribute this rise to two major events: Cloudflare migrating away from using DigiCert as a certificate authority and Google and Let’s Encrypt intermediate CA rotations.</p><p>Before migrating customer’s certificates away from using DigiCert as the CA, Cloudflare sent multiple notifications to customers to inform them that they should update or remove their certificate pins, so that the migration does not impact their domain’s availability.</p><p>However, what we’ve learned is that almost all customers that were impacted by the change were unaware that they had a certificate pin in place. One of the consequences of using certificate pinning is that the “set and forget” mentality doesn’t work, now that certificates are being rotated more frequently. Instead, changes need to be closely monitored to ensure that a regular certificate renewal doesn&#39;t cause an outage. This goes to show that to implement certificate pinning successfully, customers need a robust system in place to track certificate changes and implement them.</p><p>We built our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/\">Universal SSL</a> pipeline to be resilient and redundant, ensuring that we can always issue and renew a TLS certificate on behalf of our customers, <a href=\"/introducing-backup-certificates\">even in the event of a compromise or revocation</a>. CAs are starting to make changes like more frequent certificate rotations to encourage a move towards a more secure ecosystem. Now, it’s up to domain owners to stop implementing legacy practices like certificate pinning, which cause breaking changes, and instead start adopting modern standards that aim to provide the same level of security, but without the management overhead or risk.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"modern-standards-practices-are-making-the-need-for-certificate-pinning-obsolete\">Modern standards &amp; practices are making the need for certificate pinning obsolete</h2>\n      <a href=\"#modern-standards-practices-are-making-the-need-for-certificate-pinning-obsolete\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"shorter-certificate-lifetimes\">Shorter certificate lifetimes</h3>\n      <a href=\"#shorter-certificate-lifetimes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Over the last few years, we have seen certificate lifetimes quickly decrease. Before 2011, a certificate could be valid for up to 96 months (eight years) and now, in 2024, the maximum validity period for a certificate is 1 year. We’re seeing this trend continue to develop, with Google Chrome <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/\">pushing</a> for shorter CA, intermediate, and certificate lifetimes, advocating for 3 month certificate validity as the new standard.</p><p>This push improves security and redundancy of the entire PKI ecosystem in several ways. First, it reduces the scope of a compromise by limiting the amount of time that a malicious party could control a TLS certificate or private key. Second, it reduces reliance on certificate revocation, a process that lacks standardization and enforcement by clients, browsers, and CAs. Lastly, it encourages automation as a replacement for legacy certificate practices that are time-consuming and error-prone.</p><p>Cloudflare is moving towards only using CAs that follow the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555\">ACME</a> (Automated Certificate Management Environment) protocol, which by default, issues certificates with 90 day validity periods.

This increased rotation is beneficial from a security perspective because it limits the lifespan of intermediate certificates, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit a compromised intermediate. Additionally, regular rotations make it easier to revoke an intermediate certificate if it becomes compromised, enhancing the overall security and resiliency of the PKI ecosystem.</p><p>Both Let’s Encrypt and Google Trust Services changed their intermediate chains in June 2024. In addition, <a href=\"https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/lets-encrypt-new-intermediate-certificates/209498\">Let’s Encrypt has started to balance their certificate issuance across 10 intermediates</a> (5 RSA and 5 ECDSA).</p><p>Cloudflare customers using <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/advanced-certificate-manager/\">Advanced Certificate Manager</a> have the ability to choose their issuing CA. The issue is that even if Cloudflare uses the same CA for a certificate renewal, there is no guarantee that the same certificate chain (root or intermediate) will be used to issue the renewed certificate. As a result, if pinning is used, a successful renewal could cause a full outage for a domain or application.</p><p>This happens because certificate pinning relies on the exact matching of certificates. When an intermediate certificate is rotated or changed, the new certificate might not match the pinned certificate on the client side. As a result, the client will reject the renewed certificate, even if it’s a valid certificate issued by the same CA. This mismatch leads to a failure on the client side, causing the domain to become inaccessible until the pinned certificate is updated to reflect the new intermediate certificate. This risk of an unexpected outage is a major downside of continuing to use certificate pinning, especially as CAs increasingly update their intermediates as a security measure.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"increased-use-of-certificate-transparency\">Increased use of certificate transparency</h3>\n      <a href=\"#increased-use-of-certificate-transparency\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><a href=\"/introducing-certificate-transparency-and-nimbus\">Certificate transparency (CT) logs</a> provide a standardized framework for monitoring and auditing the issuance of TLS certificates.

IoT devices are usually equipped with more limited processing power and are oftentimes unable to perform software updates.

As a result, instead of providing the intended security benefit, it has increased the number of outages caused during a successful certificate renewal. With new enhancements in certificate issuance standards and certificate transparency, we’re encouraging our customers and the industry to move towards adopting those new standards and deprecating old ones.</p><p>If you’re a Cloudflare customer and are required to pin your certificate, the only way to ensure a zero-downtime renewal is to upload your own custom certificates. We recommend using the <a href=\"/staging-tls-certificate-every-deployment-safe-deployment\">staging network</a> to test your certificate renewal to ensure you have updated your certificate pin.</p>",
