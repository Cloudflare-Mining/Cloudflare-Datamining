How many packets will be delivered for a naive send and receive?</p><p>The sender pseudo code:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.python\"><code class=\"language-.python\">fd = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\nfd.bind((&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, 65400)) # select source port to reduce nondeterminism\nfd.connect((&quot;192.168.254.1&quot;, 4321))\nwhile True:\n    fd.sendmmsg([&quot;\\x00&quot; * 32] * 1024)</pre></code>\n            <p>While we could have used the usual <code>send</code> syscall, it wouldn&#39;t be efficient. Context switches to the kernel have a cost and it is be better to avoid it. Fortunately a handy syscall was recently added to Linux: <a href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendmmsg.2.html\"><code>sendmmsg</code></a>. It allows us to send many packets in one go. Let&#39;s do 1,024 packets at once.</p><p>The receiver pseudo code:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.python\"><code class=\"language-.python\">fd = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\nfd.bind((&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, 4321))\nwhile True:\n    packets = [None] * 1024\n    fd.recvmmsg(packets, MSG_WAITFORONE)</pre></code>\n            <p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/recvmmsg.2.html\"><code>recvmmsg</code></a> is a more efficient version of the common <code>recv</code> syscall.</p><p>Let&#39;s try it out:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.bash\"><code class=\"language-.bash\">sender$ ./udpsender 192.168.254.1:4321\nreceiver$ ./udpreceiver1 0.0.0.0:4321\n  0.352M pps  10.730MiB /  90.010Mb\n  0.284M pps   8.655MiB /  72.603Mb\n  0.262M pps   7.991MiB /  67.033Mb\n  0.199M pps   6.081MiB /  51.013Mb\n  0.195M pps   5.956MiB /  49.966Mb\n  0.199M pps   6.060MiB /  50.836Mb\n  0.200M pps   6.097MiB /  51.147Mb\n  0.197M pps   6.021MiB /  50.509Mb</pre></code>\n            <p>With the naive approach we can do between 197k and 350k pps. Not too bad. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of variability. It is caused by the kernel shuffling our programs between cores. Pinning the processes to CPUs will help:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.bash\"><code class=\"language-.bash\">sender$ taskset -c 1 ./udpsender 192.168.254.1:4321\nreceiver$ taskset -c 1 ./udpreceiver1 0.0.0.0:4321\n  0.362M pps  11.058MiB /  92.760Mb\n  0.374M pps  11.411MiB /  95.723Mb\n  0.369M pps  11.252MiB /  94.389Mb\n  0.370M pps  11.289MiB /  94.696Mb\n  0.365M pps  11.152MiB /  93.552Mb\n  0.360M pps  10.971MiB /  92.033Mb</pre></code>\n            <p>Now, the kernel scheduler keeps the processes on the defined CPUs. This improves processor cache locality and makes the numbers more consistent, just what we wanted.</p><ol><li><p>Send more packets</p></li></ol><hr/><p>While 370k pps is not bad for a naive program, it&#39;s still quite far from the goal of 1Mpps. To receive more, first we must send more packets.

The <code>rx_nodesc_drop_cnt</code> is a Solarflare specific counter saying the NIC failed to deliver 450kpps to the kernel.</p><p>Sometimes it&#39;s not obvious why the packets weren&#39;t delivered. In our case though, it&#39;s very clear: the RX queue #4 delivers packets to CPU #4. And CPU #4 can&#39;t do any more work - it&#39;s totally busy just reading the 350kpps.

Here&#39;s how to send packets to different destination IPs:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.bash\"><code class=\"language-.bash\">sender$ taskset -c 1,2 ./udpsender 192.168.254.1:4321 192.168.254.2:4321</pre></code>\n            <p><code>ethtool</code> confirms the packets go to distinct RX queues:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.bash\"><code class=\"language-.bash\">receiver$ watch &#039;sudo ethtool -S eth2 |grep rx&#039;\n     rx-0.rx_packets:     8.0/s\n     rx-1.rx_packets:     0.0/s\n     rx-2.rx_packets:     0.0/s\n     rx-3.rx_packets:  355.2k/s\n     rx-4.rx_packets:     0.5/s\n     rx-5.rx_packets:  297.0k/s\n     rx-6.rx_packets:     0.0/s\n     rx-7.rx_packets:     0.5/s\n     rx-8.rx_packets:     0.0/s\n     rx-9.rx_packets:     0.0/s\n     rx-10.rx_packets:    0.0/s</pre></code>\n            <p>The receiving part:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.bash\"><code class=\"language-.bash\">receiver$ taskset -c 1 ./udpreceiver1 0.0.0.0:4321\n  0.609M pps  18.599MiB / 156.019Mb\n  0.657M pps  20.039MiB / 168.102Mb\n  0.649M pps  19.803MiB / 166.120Mb</pre></code>\n            <p>Hurray! With two cores busy with handling RX queues, and third running the application, it&#39;s possible to get ~650k pps!</p><p>We can increase this number further by sending traffic to three or four RX queues, but soon the application will hit another limit. This time the <code>rx_nodesc_drop_cnt</code> is not growing, but the <code>netstat</code> &quot;receiver errors&quot; are:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.bash\"><code class=\"language-.bash\">receiver$ watch &#039;netstat -s --udp&#039;\nUdp:\n      437.0k/s packets received\n        0.0/s packets to unknown port received.\n      386.9k/s packet receive errors\n        0.0/s packets sent\n    RcvbufErrors:  123.8k/s\n    SndbufErrors: 0\n    InCsumErrors: 0</pre></code>\n            <p>This means that while the NIC is able to deliver the packets to the kernel, the kernel is not able to deliver the packets to the application. In our case it is able to deliver only 440kpps, the remaining 390kpps + 123kpps are dropped due to the application not receiving them fast enough.</p><ol><li><p>Receive from many threads</p></li></ol><hr/><p>We need to scale out the receiver application. The naive approach, to receive from many threads, won&#39;t work well:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.bash\"><code class=\"language-.bash\">sender$ taskset -c 1,2 ./udpsender 192.168.254.1:4321 192.168.254.2:4321\nreceiver$ taskset -c 1,2 ./udpreceiver1 0.0.0.0:4321 2\n  0.495M pps  15.108MiB / 126.733Mb\n  0.480M pps  14.636MiB / 122.775Mb\n  0.461M pps  14.071MiB / 118.038Mb\n  0.486M pps  14.820MiB / 124.322Mb</pre></code>\n            <p>The receiving performance is down compared to a single threaded program. That&#39;s caused by a lock contention on the UDP receive buffer side. Since both threads are using the same socket descriptor, they spend a disproportionate amount of time fighting for a lock around the UDP receive buffer. <a href=\"http://www.jcc2014.ucm.cl/jornadas/WORKSHOP/WSDP%202014/WSDP-4.pdf\">This paper</a> describes the problem in more detail.</p><p>Using many threads to receive from a single descriptor is not optimal.</p><ol><li><p>SO_REUSEPORT</p></li></ol><hr/><p>Fortunately, there is a workaround recently added to Linux: <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/\">the SO_REUSEPORT flag</a>. When this flag is set on a socket descriptor, Linux will allow many processes to bind to the same port. In fact, any number of processes will be allowed to bind and the load will be spread across them.</p><p>With <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> each of the processes will have a separate socket descriptor. Therefore each will own a dedicated UDP receive buffer. This avoids the contention issues previously encountered:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-.bash\"><code class=\"language-.bash\">receiver$ taskset -c 1,2,3,4 ./udpreceiver1 0.0.0.0:4321 4 1\n  1.114M pps  34.007MiB / 285.271Mb\n  1.147M pps  34.990MiB / 293.518Mb\n  1.126M pps  34.374MiB / 288.354Mb</pre></code>\n            <p>This is more like it! The throughput is decent now!</p><p>More investigation will reveal further room for improvement. Even though we started four receiving threads, the load is not being spread evenly across them:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7oGZaWKk0wzDkBTilJrIbb/1b4b3a3bb3c8755fd132b0201771eeda/port-uneven.png\" alt=\"port uneven\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"647\" height=\"82\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Two threads received all the work and the other two got no packets at all. This is caused by a hashing collision, but this time it is at the <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> layer.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"final-words\">Final words</h3>\n      <a href=\"#final-words\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>I&#39;ve done some further tests, and with perfectly aligned RX queues and receiver threads on a single NUMA node it was possible to get 1.4Mpps. Running receiver on a different NUMA node caused the numbers to drop achieving at best 1Mpps.</p><p>To sum up, if you want a perfect performance you need to:</p><ul><li><p>Ensure traffic is distributed evenly across many RX queues and<code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> processes. In practice, the load usually is well distributed as long as there are a large number of connections (or flows).</p></li><li><p>You need to have enough spare CPU capacity to actually pick up the packets from the kernel.</p></li><li><p>To make the things harder, both RX queues and receiver processes should be on a single NUMA node.</p></li></ul><p>While we had shown that it is technically possible to receive 1Mpps on a Linux machine, the application was not doing any actual processing of received packets - it didn&#39;t even look at the content of the traffic. Don&#39;t expect performance like that for any practical application without a lot more work.</p><p><i>Interested in this sort of low-level, high-performance packet wrangling?
