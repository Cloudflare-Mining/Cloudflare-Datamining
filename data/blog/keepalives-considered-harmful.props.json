It&#39;s generally expensive for a client to open a new TCP connection and our servers keep some memory pools associated with connections that need to be recycled. In fact, one of the range of mitigations we use for attack traffic is disabling keepalives for abusive clients, forcing them to reopen connections, which slows them down considerably.</p><p>To illustrate the usefulness of keepalives, here&#39;s me requesting <a href=\"http://example.com/\">http://example.com/</a> from curl over the same connection:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\">$ curl -s -w &quot;Time to connect: %{time_connect} Time to first byte: %{time_starttransfer}\\n&quot; -o /dev/null http://example.com/ -o /dev/null http://example.com/\n\nTime to connect: 0.012108 Time to first byte: 0.018724\nTime to connect: 0.000019 Time to first byte: 0.007391</pre></code>\n            <p>The first request took 18.7ms and out of them 12.1ms were used to establish a new connection, which is not even a TLS one. When I sent another request over the same connection, I didn&#39;t need to pay extra and it took just 7.3ms to service my request. That&#39;s a big win, which gets even bigger if you need to establish a brand new connection (especially if it’s not <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning-resources/tls-1-3/\">TLSv1.3</a> or <a href=\"/http3-the-past-present-and-future/\">QUIC</a>). DNS was also cached in the example above, but it may be another negative factor for domains with low TTL.</p><p>Keepalives tend to be used extensively, because they seem beneficial. Generally keepalives are enabled by default for this exact reason.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"taking-all-the-load\">Taking all the load</h3>\n      <a href=\"#taking-all-the-load\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Due to how Linux works (see the first link in this blog post), most of the load goes to a few workers out of the pool.

Generally keepalives are great and should stay enabled, but in our case the latency of local connection establishment is much lower than the delay we can get from landing on a busy worker.</p><p>In reality this means that we can run our machines hotter and not see latency rise as much as it did before.
