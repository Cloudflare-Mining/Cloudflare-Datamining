Another diagram for you to make this more visual:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1OI9zf8X8wBnNTaE0j94M2/36ba0c90984ad047ae0dd939d4d40ac3/Screen-Shot-2020-03-19-at-12.22.55.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1334\" height=\"616\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>Keepalives</h3><p>Requests come over connections that are reused for performance reasons, which is sometimes referred to as “keepalive”. It&#39;s generally expensive for a client to open a new TCP connection and our servers keep some memory pools associated with connections that need to be recycled. In fact, one of the range of mitigations we use for attack traffic is disabling keepalives for abusive clients, forcing them to reopen connections, which slows them down considerably.</p><p>To illustrate the usefulness of keepalives, here&#39;s me requesting <a href=\"http://example.com/\">http://example.com/</a> from curl over the same connection:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\">$ curl -s -w &quot;Time to connect: %{time_connect} Time to first byte: %{time_starttransfer}\\n&quot; -o /dev/null http://example.com/ -o /dev/null http://example.com/\n\nTime to connect: 0.012108 Time to first byte: 0.018724\nTime to connect: 0.000019 Time to first byte: 0.007391</pre></code>\n            <p>The first request took 18.7ms and out of them 12.1ms were used to establish a new connection, which is not even a TLS one. When I sent another request over the same connection, I didn&#39;t need to pay extra and it took just 7.3ms to service my request. That&#39;s a big win, which gets even bigger if you need to establish a brand new connection (especially if it’s not <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning-resources/tls-1-3/\">TLSv1.3</a> or <a href=\"/http3-the-past-present-and-future/\">QUIC</a>). DNS was also cached in the example above, but it may be another negative factor for domains with low TTL.</p><p>Keepalives tend to be used extensively, because they seem beneficial. Generally keepalives are enabled by default for this exact reason.</p><h3>Taking all the load</h3><p>Due to how Linux works (see the first link in this blog post), most of the load goes to a few workers out of the pool. When that worker is not able to accept() a pending connection because it&#39;s busy processing requests, that connection spills to another worker. The process cascades until some worker is ready to pick up.</p><p>This leaves us with a ladder of load spread between workers:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\">               CPU%                                       Runtime\nnobody    4254 51.2  0.8 5655600 1093848 ?

More open sockets generate more load to serve these connections. It’s a vicious circle.</p><h3>The twist</h3><p>Now that we have all these workers holding onto this connections, requests over these connections are also in a way pinned to workers:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3kvLGjxkG4Rb5l5n7cyawp/89b3155b25f7175fcf3bb217fdbde32a/Screen-Shot-2020-03-19-at-12.23.16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1238\" height=\"504\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In FL we&#39;re doing some things that are <i>somewhat</i> compute intensive, which means that some workers can be busy for a <i>somewhat</i> prolonged period of time, while other workers will be sitting idle, increasing latency for requests. Ideally we want to always hand over a request to a worker that&#39;s idle, because that maximizes our chances of not being blocked, even if it takes a few event loop iterations to serve a request (meaning that we may still block down the road).</p><p>One part of dealing with the issue is <a href=\"/the-problem-with-event-loops/\">offloading some of the compute intensive parts</a> of the request processing into a thread pool, but that was something that hadn’t happened at that point. We had to do something else in the meantime.</p><p>Clients have no way of knowing that their worker is busy and they should probably ask another worker to serve the connection. For clients over a real network this doesn&#39;t even make sense, since by the time their request comes to NGINX up to tens of milliseconds later, the situation will probably be different.</p><p>But our clients are not over a long haul network! They are local and they are SSL connecting over a Unix socket. It&#39;s not exactly that expensive to reopen a new connection for each request and what it gives is the ability to pass a fully formed request that&#39;s buffered in SSL into FL:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3LnukCCSMEeSewRhJdI6aA/049dfe5dff527fe5e73d970cd10bc00d/Screen-Shot-2020-03-19-at-12.23.28.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"538\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Two key points here:</p><ul><li><p>The request is always picked up by an idle worker</p></li><li><p>The request is readily available for potentially compute intensive processing</p></li></ul><p>The former is the most important part.</p><h3>Validating the hypothesis</h3><p>To validate this assumption, I wrote the following program:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\">package main\n \nimport (\n    &quot;flag&quot;\n    &quot;io/ioutil&quot;\n    &quot;log&quot;\n    &quot;net/http&quot;\n    &quot;os&quot;\n    &quot;time&quot;\n)\n \nfunc main() {\n    u := flag.String(&quot;url&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;url to request&quot;)\n    p := flag.Duration(&quot;pause&quot;, 0, &quot;pause between requests&quot;)\n    t := flag.Duration(&quot;threshold&quot;, 0, &quot;threshold for reporting&quot;)\n    c := flag.Int(&quot;count&quot;, 10000, &quot;number of requests to send&quot;)\n    n := flag.Int(&quot;close&quot;, 1, &quot;close connection after every that many requests&quot;)\n \n    flag.Parse()\n \n    if *u == &quot;&quot; {\n        flag.PrintDefaults()\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n \n    client := http.Client{}\n \n    for i := 0; i &lt; *c; i++ {\n        started := time.Now()\n \n        request, err := http.NewRequest(&quot;GET&quot;, *u, nil)\n        if err != nil {\n            log.Fatalf(&quot;Error constructing request: %s&quot;, err)\n        }\n \n        if i%*n == 0 {\n            request.Header.Set(&quot;Connection&quot;, &quot;Close&quot;)\n        }\n \n        response, err := client.Do(request)\n        if err != nil {\n            log.Fatalf(&quot;Error performing request: %s&quot;, err)\n        }\n \n        _, err = ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)\n        if err != nil {\n            log.Fatalf(&quot;Error reading request body: %s&quot;, err)\n        }\n \n        response.Body.Close()\n \n        elapsed := time.Since(started)\n        if elapsed &gt; *t {\n            log.Printf(&quot;Request %d took %dms&quot;, i, int(elapsed.Seconds()*1000))\n        }\n \n        time.Sleep(*p)\n    }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>The program connects to a requested URL and recycles the connection after X requests have completed.

Having just one of them is not as beneficial to lower latency.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>We disabled keepalives between SSL and FL running on the same box and this greatly improved our tail latency caused by requests landing on non-optimal FL workers. This was an unexpected fix, but it worked and we are able to explain it.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that you should go and disable keepalives everywhere. Generally keepalives are great and should stay enabled, but in our case the latency of local connection establishment is much lower than the delay we can get from landing on a busy worker.</p><p>In reality this means that we can run our machines hotter and not see latency rise as much as it did before. Imagine moving the CPU cap from 50% to 80% with no effect on latency. The numbers are arbitrary, but the idea holds. Running hotter allows for fewer machines able to serve the same amount of traffic, reducing our overall footprint. ?</p>",
