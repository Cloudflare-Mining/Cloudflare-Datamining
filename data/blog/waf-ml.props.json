Cloudflare is in the unique position of protecting traffic for 1 out of 5 Internet properties which allows it to identify threats as they arise and track how these evolve and mutate.</p><p>The Web Application Firewall (WAF) sits at the core of Cloudflare&#39;s security toolbox and  Managed Rules are a key feature of the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">WAF</a>. They are a collection of rules created by Cloudflare’s analyst team that block requests when they show patterns of known attacks. These managed rules work extremely well for patterns of established attack vectors, as they have been extensively tested to minimize both false negatives (missing an attack) and false positives (finding an attack when there isn’t one). On the downside, managed rules often miss attack variations (also known as bypasses) as static regex-based rules are intrinsically sensitive to signature variations introduced, for example, by fuzzing techniques.</p><p>We witnessed this issue when we released <a href=\"/exploitation-of-cve-2021-44228-before-public-disclosure-and-evolution-of-waf-evasion-patterns/\">protections for log4j</a>. For a few days, after the vulnerability was made public, we had to constantly update the rules to match variations and mutations as attackers tried to bypass the WAF. Moreover, optimizing rules requires significant human intervention, and it usually works only after bypasses have been identified or even exploited, making the protection reactive rather than proactive.</p><p>Today we are excited to complement managed rulesets (such as OWASP and Cloudflare Managed) with a new tool aimed at identifying bypasses and malicious payloads without human involvement, and before they are exploited. Customers can now access signals from a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-machine-learning/\">machine learning model</a> trained on the good/bad traffic as classified by managed rules and augmented data to provide better protection across a broader range of old and new attacks.</p><p>Welcome to our new Machine Learning WAF detection.</p><p>The new detection is available in Early Access for Enterprise, Pro and Biz customers. Please <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/waf-ml/\">join the waitlist</a> if you are interested in trying it out.

This enables a new WAF analytics experience that allows you to explore trends and patterns in your overall traffic.</p></li><li><p>Detection rate improves based on past traffic and feedback. The model is trained on good and bad traffic as categorized by managed rules across all Cloudflare traffic. This allows small sites to get the same level of protection as the largest Internet properties.</p></li><li><p>A new definition of performance. The machine learning engine identifies bypasses and anomalies before they are exploited or identified by human researchers.</p></li></ol><p>The secret sauce is a combination of innovative machine learning modeling, a vast training dataset built on the attacks we block daily as well as data augmentation techniques, the right evaluation and testing framework based on the behavioral testing principle and cutting-edge engineering that allows us to assess each request with negligible latency.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"a-new-waf-experience\">A new WAF experience</h3>\n            <a href=\"#a-new-waf-experience\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The new detection is based on the paradigm launched with <a href=\"/introducing-bot-analytics/\">Bot Analytics</a>.

Users can create custom WAF/Firewall rules using three separate scores: a total score (<code>cf.waf.ml.score</code>), one for SQLi and one for XSS (<code>cf.waf.ml.score.sqli</code>, <code>cf.waf.ml.score.xss</code>, respectively). The scores can have values between 1 and 99, with 1 being definitely malicious and 99 being valid traffic.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2L5nEecwBOfJNrWlLAmW7n/81c3454f461d1bd4a1bc07801729a555/image4-1.png\" alt=\"Histogram of the score across all traffic hitting an application.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"475\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The model is then trained based on traffic classified by the existing WAF rules, and it works on a transformed version of the original request, making it easier to identify fingerprints of attacks.</p><p>For each request, the model scores each part of the request independently so that it’s possible to identify where malicious payloads were identified, for example, in the body of the request, the URI or headers.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/36nH3d4BUBlVDtBUGwulaP/152add49afbc256f0f38d52476c227da/image1-30.png\" alt=\"The detection engine provides a breakdown of where the threats were found (for example, body, URI, headers).\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"485\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This looks easy on paper, but there are a number of challenges that Cloudflare engineers had to solve to get here.
