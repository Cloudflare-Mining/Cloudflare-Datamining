For example, if a user&#39;s input is the number 5, her input could be split into two shares of [10,-5].</p></li><li><p>The input share pieces are then distributed between different, non-colluding servers for aggregation (in this example, simply summed up). Similar to Privacy Gateway or Private Proxy, no one party has all the information needed to reconstruct any user&#39;s input.</p></li><li><p>Depending on the use case, the servers will then communicate with one another in order to verify that the input is &quot;valid&quot; – so that no one can insert an input that throws off the entire results. The magic of multi-party computation is that the servers can perform this computation without learning anything about the input beyond its validity.</p></li><li><p>Once enough input shares have been aggregated to ensure strong anonymity and a statistically significant sample size – each server sends its sum of the input shares to the overall consumer of this service to then compute the final result.</p></li></ol><p>For simplicity, the above example talks about measurements as summed up numbers, but DAP describes algorithms for multiple different types of inputs: the most common string input, or a linear regression, for example.</p><p>Early iterations of this system have been implemented by Apple and Google for COVID-19 <a href=\"https://www.abetterinternet.org/post/prio-services-for-covid-en/\">exposure notifications</a>, but there are many other potential use cases for a system like this: think sensitive browser telemetry, geolocation data – any situation where one has a question about a population of users, but doesn&#39;t want to have to measure them directly.</p><p>Because this system requires different parties to operate separate aggregation servers, Cloudflare is working with several partners to act as one of the aggregation servers for DAP. We’re calling our implementation <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/daphne\">Daphne</a>, and it’s built on top of Cloudflare Workers.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"privacy-still-requires-trust\">Privacy still requires trust</h3>\n            <a href=\"#privacy-still-requires-trust\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Part of what&#39;s cool about these systems is that they distribute information — whether user data, network traffic, or both — amongst multiple parties.</p><p>While we think that products included in Privacy Edge are moving the Internet in the right direction, we understand that trust only goes so far.
