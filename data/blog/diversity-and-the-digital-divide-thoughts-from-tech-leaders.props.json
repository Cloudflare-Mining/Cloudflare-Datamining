And what a survey allows you to do is let people&#39;s voices be heard who are not always willing to raise their hand or speak the loudest.</p><p>So at SurveyMonkey, we always made sure that when we were thinking about user testing and we were thinking about usability testing — that it was that broad swath of the customer because you wanted people across all different segments to submit their opinion.</p><p>I think that collecting data in a way that can be anonymized, collecting data in a way that lets people have a thoughtful versus always off the cuff conversation is really important. And what we also provided was a benchmarking product, because if you don’t know how you rank and stack against other people, you don’t know if you’re doing well or not.</p><p><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/event/4x8tWNkjLQgp8hhahSxe8y\"><i>Watch the full interview</i></a></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"on-the-importance-of-immersion\">On the importance of immersion</h3>\n      <a href=\"#on-the-importance-of-immersion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><b>Bonita Stewart</b><i>Vice President, Global Partnerships &amp; Americas Partnerships Solutions of Google</i></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2XzzpMBpzTpT3rxq2os47l/493e5d6d36e9f2da65d438939958ca52/image4-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>It&#39;s been part of my mission to make sure that technology is introduced particularly into the African-American community, so that people see it as a viable career and not something that’s on a path that requires a different risk profile or certain level of education. It should be accessible. So one of the things that I did — I was doing some research and I found that close to 25% of the STEM grads come from historically Black colleges. And there are many education programs we [Google] work with, but there was never anything for the students to have an immersive experience.</p><p>And the thought was, what if we had <i>Howard West</i> at Google? So we had a partnership with Howard University, and worked with Dr. Frederick (President of Howard University) and said: what if your students could actually spend time in the valley so that they could have an immersive experience? So they brought their faculty, along with their students. And there was just an outpouring from Google of volunteers saying, “I’d love to teach the students, is there a role for me that I can play?”</p><p>And that was in 2017. Now we have over ten schools — historically Black colleges, as well as historically Hispanic colleges and universities.</p><p><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/event/2i55cjkjlDW3a9q5zxMixC\"><i>Watch the full interview</i></a></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"on-making-the-internet-accessible-to-those-who-cant-afford-the-expense\">On making the Internet accessible to those who can’t afford the expense</h3>\n      <a href=\"#on-making-the-internet-accessible-to-those-who-cant-afford-the-expense\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><b>Erik Hersman</b><i>Co-founder and CEO of BRCK</i></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3tgkXJc21hsFfOwa91Bvw1/3a78c79090ffb95b005c90ab2ff8310e/image3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"300\" height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>BRCK makes rugged, portable devices that provide free Wi-Fi access to areas throughout Kenya and Rwanda.</i></p><p>We install our devices in buses and public transportation in Kenya and Rwanda.

And this is the only way we found that we could do that. And so we have businesses who end up paying us [to serve advertisements, surveys, and microwork tasks] and that&#39;s what subsidizes that cost.</p><p><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/event/2Zm5Uxe9q17xnywn2fnnIR\"><i>Watch the full interview</i></a></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"on-defying-expectations\">On defying expectations</h3>\n      <a href=\"#on-defying-expectations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><b>Shellye Archambeau</b><i>Former CEO of MetricStream</i><i>Board member for Verizon, Okta, Nordstrom, and Roper Technologies</i></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/CnK8PQp67wAWpIEHWrqA5/cb2c27e90a46cca0330b58730f2bc31d/image2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"300\" height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When I first came to Silicon Valley, I was shocked.

And so that part was really a shock. And you know, I&#39;m sure some things were more challenging for me. I wasn&#39;t in anybody else&#39;s shoes, so I don&#39;t know if it was easier for them, but…</p><p>I’ve been in tech my entire career so I always approach things the same way. I assume that people are going to think that I&#39;m not quite capable. Not quite competent, not quite… Just that little — I know people are going to think that.</p><p>So I try to go in the same way each time. It&#39;s like I have to prove myself both to the people who I&#39;m working for and to the people who are working for me. And I&#39;ve always found that using a servant leader approach is the most effective way. To really go in and focus on the team. If I can help the team be successful, then I will be successful.
