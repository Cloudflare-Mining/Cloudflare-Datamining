Whenever there is a spike, it is likely an attack or attack attempt has happened.</p><p>As mentioned above, different from <a href=\"/new-firewall-tab-and-analytics/\">Security Events</a>, the dataset used in this page is HTTP requests which includes both mitigated and not mitigated requests. By <a href=\"/application-security/#definitions\">mitigated requests</a> here, we mean “any HTTP request that had a ‘terminating’ action applied by the Cloudflare platform”. The rest of the requests that have not been mitigated are either served by Cloudflare’s cache or reaching the origin. In the case such as a spike in not mitigated requests but flat in mitigated requests, an assumption could be that there was an attack that did not match any active WAF rule. In this example, you can one click to filter on not mitigated requests right in the chart which will update all the data visualized on this page supporting further investigations.</p><p>In addition to the default plotting of not mitigated and mitigated requests, you can also choose to plot trends of either attack analysis or bot analysis allowing you to spot anomalies for attack or bot behaviors.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/68ZPoNtii7Si5DF06pxVVY/cec0589f2c78dc23cc9501cdb070bfa2/image7-2.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of default plotting of mitigated versus not mitigated requests\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1729\" height=\"896\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"zoom-in-with-analysis-signals\">Zoom in with analysis signals</h3>\n      <a href=\"#zoom-in-with-analysis-signals\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>One of the most loved and trusted analysis signals by our customers is the bot score.

By a simple click on any one of the insights, a preset of filters is applied zooming directly onto the portion of your traffic that you are interested in. From here, you can review the sampled logs or further fine tune any of the applied filters. This approach has been proven with further internal studies of a highly efficient workflow that in many cases will be your starting point of using this dashboard.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1l8PBc150OLKligyn93h76/bc692e61e0f0d8c11ec1719c3195a169/image1-11.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of 5 insights of different perspective of total traffic\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1103\" height=\"509\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-can-i-get-it\">How can I get it?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-can-i-get-it\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The new Security Analytics is being gradually rolled out to all Enterprise customers who have purchased the new Application Security Core or Advanced Bundles.
