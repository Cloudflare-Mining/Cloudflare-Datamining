In line with this, we&#39;re excited to announce a preview of the latest models and features available for deployment on Cloudflare&#39;s network.</p><p>One of the standout models is <code>deep-seek-coder-6.7b</code>, which notably scores <a href=\"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder\">approximately 15% higher</a> on popular benchmarks against comparable Code Llama models. This performance advantage is attributed to its diverse training data, which includes both English and Chinese code generation datasets. In addition, the <code>openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b</code> model showcases how high quality fine-tuning datasets can improve the accuracy of base models. This Mistral 7b fine-tune outperforms the base model by <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B#benchmark-results\">approximately 10% on many LLM benchmarks</a>.</p><p>We&#39;re also introducing innovative models that incorporate Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), such as the <code>llama-2-13b-awq</code>. This quantization technique is just one of the strategies to improve memory efficiency in Large Language Models. While <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-quantization/\">quantization</a> generally boosts inference efficiency in AI models, it often does so at the expense of precision. AWQ strikes a balance to mitigate this tradeoff.</p><p>The pace of progress in AI can be overwhelming, but Cloudflare&#39;s Workers AI simplifies getting started with the latest models. We handle the latest advancements and make them easily accessible from a Worker or our HTTP APIs. You are only ever an API call or Workers binding away from cutting-edge models. Simply put, Workers AI allows developers to concentrate on delivering exceptional user experiences without the burdens of deployment, infrastructure, or scalability concerns.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"using-ai-to-safeguard-your-applications\">Using AI to safeguard your applications</h3>\n      <a href=\"#using-ai-to-safeguard-your-applications\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>A newer use case we support with this model catalog update is the ability to classify and check prompts and responses with <code>llamaguard-7b-awq</code>.
