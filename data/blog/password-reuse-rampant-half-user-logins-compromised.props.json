When we perform these checks, Cloudflare does not access or store plaintext end user passwords. We have built a privacy-preserving credential checking service that helps protect our users from compromised credentials. <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/helping-keep-customers-safe-with-leaked-password-notification/#how-does-cloudflare-check-for-leaked-credentials\"><u>Passwords are hashed – i.e., converted into a random string of characters using a cryptographic algorithm – for the purpose of comparing them against a database of leaked credentials.</u></a> This not only warns site owners that their end users’ credentials may be compromised; it also allows site owners to issue a password reset or enable MFA. These protections help prevent attacks that use automated attempts to guess information, like usernames and passwords, to gain access to a system or network. Read more on how our leaked credentials detection scans work <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>Our data analysis focuses on traffic from Internet properties on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/\">Cloudflare’s free plan</a>, which includes <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/\"><u>leaked credentials detection</u></a> as a built-in feature. Leaked credentials refer to usernames and passwords exposed in known data breaches or credential dumps — for this analysis, our focus is specifically on leaked passwords. With 30 million Internet properties, <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/proxy/all\"><u>comprising some 20% of the web</u></a>, behind Cloudflare, this analysis provides significant insights.

To understand human behavior, we focus on successful login attempts (those returning a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200\"><u>200 OK</u></a> status code), as this provides the clearest indication of user activity and real account risk. Our data reveals that approximately 41% of successful human authentication attempts involve leaked credentials.</p><p>Despite growing awareness about online security, a significant portion of users continue to reuse passwords across multiple accounts. And according to a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/american-password-habits/\"><u>recent study by Forbes</u></a>, users will, on average, reuse their password across four different accounts. Even after major breaches, many individuals don’t change their compromised passwords, or still use variations of them across different services. For these users, it’s not a matter of “if” attackers will use their compromised passwords, it’s a matter of “when”.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/71DMUKH3ZzY1hr0bsavGj3/16eed591ce9b34fd4aead27746a85acf/image4.png\" alt=\"graph showing human traffic distribution, with time on X-axis, and percentage of requests on Y-axis, it shows 59% of human traffic clean from leaked credentials against 41% with leaked passwords\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1882\" height=\"634\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>When we expand to include bot-driven traffic in this analysis, the problem of leaked credentials becomes even more noticeable.
