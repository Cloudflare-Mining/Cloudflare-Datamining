When you request a website (say, cloudflare.com), the website should present a certificate that proves its identity. This certificate is like a stamp of approval: it says that your connection is secure. In other words, the certificate proves that content was not intercepted or modified while in transit to you. An altered Cloudflare site would be problematic, especially if it looked like the actual Cloudflare site. Certificates protect us by including information about websites and their owners.</p><p>We pass around these certificates because <b>the honor system doesn’t work on the Internet</b>. If you want a certificate for your own website, just request one from a Certificate Authority (CA), or sign up for Cloudflare and we’ll do it for you! CAs issue certificates just as real-life notaries stamp legal documents. They confirm your identity, look over some data, and use their special status to grant you a digital certificate. Popular CAs include DigiCert, Let’s Encrypt, and Sectigo. This system has served us well because it has kept imposters in check, but also promoted trust between domain owners and their visitors.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6rSjggcosa2uxJsC5WHSq/f22de7e8f2fcf233037a18a3f69010c2/image12.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"792\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Unfortunately, nothing is perfect.</p><p>It turns out that CAs make mistakes. In rare cases, they become reckless. When this happens, <i>illegitimate</i> certificates are issued (even though they appear to be authentic). If a CA accidentally issues a certificate for your website, but you did <i>not</i> request the certificate, you have a problem. Whoever received the certificate might be able to:</p><ol><li><p>Steal login credentials from your visitors.</p></li><li><p>Interrupt your usual services by serving different content.</p></li></ol><p><a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2016/12/how-the-2011-hack-of-diginotar-changed-the-internets-infrastructure.html\">These attacks <i>do</i> happen</a>, so there’s good reason to care about certificates. More often, domain owners lose track of their certificates and panic when they discover unexpected certificates. We need a way to prevent these situations from ruining the entire system.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"certificate-transparency\">Certificate Transparency</h2>\n            <a href=\"#certificate-transparency\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Ah, Certificate Transparency (CT). CT solves the problem I just described by making all certificates public and easy to audit. When CAs issue certificates, they must submit certificates to at least two “public logs.” This means that collectively, the logs carry important data about all trusted certificates on the Internet. Several companies offer CT logs — Google has launched a few of its own. <a href=\"/introducing-certificate-transparency-and-nimbus/\">We announced Cloudflare&#39;s Nimbus log last year</a>.</p><p>Logs are really, really big, and often hold hundreds of millions of certificate records.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5GbvFMP5eeaj2RWq6Yaxsf/a1055a89cd2f34496b18f5a71e7ad117/image1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1258\" height=\"861\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The log infrastructure helps browsers validate websites’ identities. When you request cloudflare.com in Safari or Google Chrome, the browser will actually require Cloudflare’s certificate to be registered in a CT log. If the certificate isn’t found in a log, you won’t see the lock icon next to the address bar. Instead, the browser will tell you that the website you’re trying to access is not secure. Are you going to visit a website marked “NOT SECURE”? Probably not.</p><p>There are systems that audit CT logs and report illegitimate certificates. Therefore, if your browser finds a valid certificate that is also trusted in a log, everything is secure.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"what-were-announcing-today\">What We&#39;re Announcing Today</h2>\n            <a href=\"#what-were-announcing-today\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare has been an industry leader in CT.

At some point in time, you (or an impostor) request a certificate for your website. A Certificate Authority approves the request and issues the certificate. Within 24 hours, the CA sends this certificate to a set of CT logs. This is where we come in: Cloudflare uses an internal process known as “The Crawler” to look through millions of certificate records. Merkle Town dispatches The Crawler to monitor CT logs and check for new certificates. When The Crawler finds a new certificate, it pulls the entire certificate through Merkle Town.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7r0eW4WoQeH64mvg354HO6/81ed08a9d6b3264a44ea74ce3694b8c3/image4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1126\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When we process the certificate in Merkle Town, we also check it against a list of monitored domains.

Most of the time, certificate alerts are routine. Certificates expire and renew on a regular basis, so it’s totally normal to get these emails. If everything looks correct (the issuer, your domain name, etc.), go ahead and toss that email in the trash.</p><p>In rare cases, you might get an email that looks suspicious. <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031379012\">We provide a detailed support article that will help</a>. The basic protocol is this:</p><ol><li><p>Contact the CA (listed as “Issuer” in the email).</p></li><li><p>Explain <i>why</i> you think the certificate is suspicious.</p></li><li><p>The CA should revoke the certificate (if it really is malicious).</p></li></ol><p>We also have a friendly support team that can be reached <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172476\">here</a>. While Cloudflare is not at CA and cannot revoke certificates, our support team knows quite a bit about certificate management and is ready to help.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"the-future\">The Future</h2>\n            <a href=\"#the-future\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3yBCtqs81a22hZy4ri78Nb/f61cf359f273a3cbb7be0d7e763e1a86/image2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1383\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Certificate Transparency has started making regular appearances on the Cloudflare blog. Why? It’s required by Chrome and Safari, <a href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/\">which dominate the browser market</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/chromium/ct-policy\">set precedents for Internet security</a>. But more importantly, CT can help us spot malicious certificates <i>before</i> they are used in attacks. This is why we will continue to refine and improve our certificate detection methods.</p><p>What are you waiting for?
