This past Monday, April 18, 2022, was <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/taxes/2022/04/18/taxes-due-2022-live-coverage/7353661001/\">Tax Day</a>. So, were US citizens procrastinators, leaving their federal (and state) tax returns to the last day? Traffic to tax-related official federal and state websites seems to show it: there was a spike of more than 470% on April 18.</p><p>Just for reference, we can see on <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/us\">Cloudflare Radar</a> that Internet traffic in the US, from our perspective, wasn’t significantly impacted on Monday, April 18, although there was a clear peak, higher than in the previous 14 days, that night at 22:00 EST (that’s 02:00 UTC on April 19). So, traffic (that includes DNS and HTTP requests from our standpoint) was 18% higher compared to the same time on the previous Monday.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7AvrEhVnWiVC4wZFOZ4FVU/39ec1e6a9ec7919a31229db7b5b58973/image6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>For the following charts, Cloudflare Radar uses a variety of sources to provide aggregate information about Internet traffic and attack trends. In this blog post, we will use DNS name resolution data as a proxy for traffic to Internet services, as we did for <a href=\"/who-won-super-bowl-lvi-a-look-at-internet-traffic-during-the-big-game/\">Super Bowl LVI</a> or for the <a href=\"/oscars-2022-impact/\">Oscars 2022</a>.</p><p>In this case, the baseline value for the charts (that we use to get the percent growth) was calculated by taking the mean DNS traffic level for the associated Internet services on March 31 — a typical day before from the April 18 deadline. On these charts, we are using the EST timezone.</p><p>Let’s start with an aggregate of all the federal and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_tax_levels_in_the_United_States\">state level</a> official tax-related sites. This Monday, DNS requests jumped at 13:00 EST to 472% more than usual (the average on March 31 for all the 51 sites we’re checking is the baseline here). That’s 203% more than the previous highest growth day in April.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7xV0ZSsMxdLPavsYVIPsIr/2f1985ff91035ebe9320af838fc0d36c/image3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"701\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Here are the top five days in April ranked by traffic increase:</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"us-federal-and-state-official-tax-sites-peaks-in-requests\">US federal and state official tax sites peaks in requests</h3>\n            <a href=\"#us-federal-and-state-official-tax-sites-peaks-in-requests\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <ol><li><p>Monday, April 18 (Tax Day 2022), 13:00 — 472% growth.</p></li><li><p>Thursday, April 14, 15:00 — 269%.</p></li><li><p>Friday, April 15, 15:00 — 264%.</p></li><li><p>Monday, April 11, 13:00 — 252%.</p></li><li><p>Wednesday, April 13, 14:00 — 251%.</p></li></ol>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"taxes-on-weekdays\">Taxes on weekdays</h3>\n            <a href=\"#taxes-on-weekdays\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Another trend in the previous chart is that people seem to use more weekdays in April than the weekends to submit their taxes (or to visit official tax-related sites).
