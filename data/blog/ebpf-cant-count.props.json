Huh.</p><p>If you&#39;ve seen Marek&#39;s <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/majek04/linux-at-cloudflare\">presentation</a> from the Netdev 0x13 conference, you know that we are using BPF socket filters as one of the defenses against simple, volumetric DoS attacks.

The input for our BPF program comes from a <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2019-04-ebpf-alu32/bpf/filter.c#L44\">BPF array map</a>, so that the values we operate on are not known at build time.

The patch in question first landed in Linux 5.0 and was backported to 4.20.6 stable and 4.19.19 LTS kernel. <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=979d63d50c0c0f7bc537bf821e056cc9fe5abd38\">The over 2000 words long commit message</a> doesn&#39;t spare you any details on the attack vector it targets.</p><p>The mitigation stems from <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7308\">CVE-2019-7308</a> vulnerability <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1711\">discovered by Jann Horn at Project Zero</a>, which exploits pointer arithmetic, i.e. adding a scalar value to a pointer, to trigger speculative memory loads from out-of-bounds addresses.

The eBPF verifier keeps track of what kind of values the ALU is operating on, and in this corner case the state was ignored.</p><p>Why running BPF as root is fine, you ask? If your program has <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> privileges, side-channel mitigations <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/bpf/verifier.c#L7218\">don&#39;t</a> <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/bpf/verifier.c#L3109\">apply</a>. As root you already have access to kernel address space, so nothing new can leak through BPF.</p><p>After our report, <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3612af783cf52c74a031a2f11b82247b2599d3cd\">the fix</a> has quickly landed in v5.0 kernel and got backported to stable kernels 4.20.15 and 4.19.28. Kudos to Daniel Borkmann for getting the fix out fast. However, kernel upgrades are hard and in the meantime we were left with code running in production that was not doing what it was supposed to.</p><h3>32-bit ALU to the rescue</h3><p>As one of the eBPF maintainers <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/af0643e0-08a1-6326-2a80-71892de1bf56@iogearbox.net/\">has pointed out</a>, 32-bit arithmetic operations are not affected by the verifier bug. This opens a door for a work-around.</p><p>eBPF registers, <code>r0</code>..<code>r10</code>, are 64-bits wide, but you can also access just the lower 32 bits, which are exposed as subregisters <code>w0</code>..<code>w10</code>. You can operate on the 32-bit subregisters using BPF ALU32 instruction subset. LLVM 7+ can generate eBPF code that uses this instruction subset. Of course, you need to you ask it nicely with trivial <code>-Xclang -target-feature -Xclang +alu32</code> toggle:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cat sub32.c\n#include &quot;common.h&quot;\n\nu32 sub32(u32 x, u32 y)\n{\n        return x - y;\n}\n$ clang -O2 -target bpf -Xclang -target-feature -Xclang +alu32 -c sub32.c\n$ llvm-objdump -S -no-show-raw-insn sub32.o\n…\nsub32:\n       0:       bc 10 00 00 00 00 00 00         w0 = w1\n       1:       1c 20 00 00 00 00 00 00         w0 -= w2\n       2:       95 00 00 00 00 00 00 00         exit</pre></code>\n            <p>The <code>0x1c</code> <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/include/uapi/linux/bpf_common.h#L11\">opcode</a> of the instruction #1, which can be broken down as <code>BPF_ALU | BPF_X | BPF_SUB</code> (read more in the <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/filter.txt\">kernel docs</a>), is the 32-bit subtraction between registers we are looking for, as opposed to regular 64-bit subtract operation <code>0x1f = BPF_ALU64 | BPF_X | BPF_SUB</code>, which will get rewritten.</p><p>Armed with this knowledge we can borrow a page from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic\">bignum arithmetic</a> and subtract 64-bit numbers using just 32-bit ops:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\">u64 sub64(u64 x, u64 y)\n{\n        u32 xh, xl, yh, yl;\n        u32 hi, lo;\n\n        xl = x;\n        yl = y;\n        lo = xl - yl;\n\n        xh = x &gt;&gt; 32;\n        yh = y &gt;&gt; 32;\n        hi = xh - yh - (lo &gt; xl); /* underflow? */\n\n        return ((u64)hi &lt;&lt; 32) | (u64)lo;\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>This code compiles as expected on normal architectures, like x86-64 or ARM64, but BPF Clang target plays by its own rules:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ clang -O2 -target bpf -Xclang -target-feature -Xclang +alu32 -c sub64.c -o - \\\n  | llvm-objdump -S -\n…  \n      13:       1f 40 00 00 00 00 00 00         r0 -= r4\n      14:       1f 30 00 00 00 00 00 00         r0 -= r3\n      15:       1f 21 00 00 00 00 00 00         r1 -= r2\n      16:       67 00 00 00 20 00 00 00         r0 &lt;&lt;= 32\n      17:       67 01 00 00 20 00 00 00         r1 &lt;&lt;= 32\n      18:       77 01 00 00 20 00 00 00         r1 &gt;&gt;= 32\n      19:       4f 10 00 00 00 00 00 00         r0 |= r1\n      20:       95 00 00 00 00 00 00 00         exit</pre></code>\n            <p>Apparently the compiler decided it was better to operate on 64-bit registers and discard the upper 32 bits. Thus we weren&#39;t able to get rid of the problematic <code>0x1f</code> opcode. Annoying, back to square one.</p><h3>Surely a bit of IR will do?</h3><p>The problem was in Clang frontend - compiling C to IR. We know that BPF &quot;assembly&quot; backend for LLVM can generate bytecode that uses ALU32 instructions. Maybe if we tweak the Clang compiler&#39;s output just a little we can achieve what we want. This means we have to get our hands dirty with the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR).</p><p>If you haven&#39;t heard of LLVM IR before, now is a good time to do some <a href=\"http://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html\">reading</a><a href=\"#f2\"><sup>2</sup></a>.

You will likely find the <a href=\"https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html\">LLVM IR reference</a> helpful when deciphering it.</p><p>And voila! First working solution that produces correct results:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ ./run-bpf -filter ir $[2**32] 1\narg0           4294967296 0x0000000100000000\narg1                    1 0x0000000000000001\ndiff           4294967295 0x00000000ffffffff</pre></code>\n            <p>Actually using this hand-written IR function from C is tricky.

The downside is that linking IR modules to your C modules is hard. Fortunately there is a better way.

To recap, if we ask Clang to subtract 32-bit integers, it will operate on 64-bit values and throw away the top 32-bits. Putting C, IR, and eBPF side-by-side helps visualize this:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/33bbylbcFR7zuF7NwxHcTs/db4601a655f51b4f1caa2f76e15aa52a/sub32_v1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1224\" height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The trick to get around it is to declare the 32-bit variable that holds the result as <code>volatile</code>. You might already know the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_(computer_programming)\"><code>volatile</code> keyword</a> if you&#39;ve written Unix signal handlers. It basically tells the compiler that the value of the variable may change under its feet so it should refrain from reorganizing loads (reads) from it, as well as that stores (writes) to it might have side-effects so changing the order or eliminating them, by skipping writing it to the memory, is not allowed either.</p><p>Using <code>volatile</code> makes Clang emit <a href=\"https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#volatile-memory-accesses\">special loads and/or stores</a> at the IR level, which then on eBPF level translates to writing/reading the value from memory (stack) on every access. While this sounds not related to the problem at hand, there is a surprising side-effect to it:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2fEaCu15LmmeauGv7Vh1Wb/9c88d48aec30a92c58b872bece04a290/sub32_v2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1386\" height=\"324\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>With volatile access compiler doesn&#39;t promote the subtraction to 64 bits! Don&#39;t ask me why, although I would love to hear an explanation. For now, consider this a hack. One that does not come for free - there is the overhead of going through the stack on each read/write.</p><p>However, if we play our cards right we just might reduce it a little. We don&#39;t actually need the volatile load or store to happen, we just want the side effect. So instead of declaring the value as volatile, which implies that both reads and writes are volatile, let&#39;s try to make only the writes volatile with a help of a macro:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\">/* Emits a &quot;store volatile&quot; in LLVM IR */\n#define ST_V(rhs, lhs) (*(volatile typeof(rhs) *) &amp;(rhs) = (lhs))</pre></code>\n            <p>If this macro looks strangely familiar, it&#39;s because it does the same thing as <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.1-rc5/source/include/linux/compiler.h#L214\"><code>WRITE_ONCE()</code> macro</a> in the Linux kernel. Applying it to our example:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3qQ1CrUvUBsJJE09xVqzA1/b54a6ee30aaabb74fb6cb9c21001c99b/sub32_v3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1424\" height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>That&#39;s another <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2019-04-ebpf-alu32/bpf/filter.c#L143\">hacky but working solution</a>. Pick your poison.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/28GXw3wm8YlUgg9nvnBwEx/622d035d7c8e40a23ce0ccf5fd4990c9/poison_bottles-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a> <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:D-BW-Kressbronn_aB_-_Kl%C3%A4ranlage_067.jpg\">image</a> by ANKAWÜ</p><p>So there you have it - from C, to IR, and back to C to hack around a bug in eBPF verifier and be able to subtract 64-bit integers again. Usually you won&#39;t have to dive into LLVM IR or assembly to make use of eBPF. But it does help to know a little about it when things don&#39;t work as expected.</p><p>Did I mention that 64-bit addition is also broken? Have fun fixing it!</p><hr/><p><sup>1</sup> Okay, it was more like 3 months time until the bug was discovered and fixed.</p><p><sup>2</sup> Some even think that it is <a href=\"https://idea.popcount.org/2013-07-24-ir-is-better-than-assembly/\">better than assembly</a>.</p><p><sup>3</sup> How do we know? The litmus test is to look for statements matching <code>r[0-9] [-+]= r[0-9]</code> in BPF assembly.</p>",
