We are extending our CPU limits to allow customers to bring all of their workloads onto Workers, no matter how intensive. It eliminates the choice that developers often have to make, between running fast, simple work on the Edge or running heavy computation in a centralized cloud with unlimited resources.</p><p>This platform will unlock a new class of intensive applications with heavy computation burdens like image processing or complex algorithms. In fact, this is a highly requested feature that we’ve previously unlocked for a number of our enterprise customers, and are now in the process of making it widely available to the public.</p><p>Workers Unbound is built to be a general purpose computing platform, not just as an alternative to niche edge computing offerings.

Most serverless platforms have inherited containers from their cloud computing origins. Cloudflare has had the opportunity to rethink serverless by building on the Edge and making this technology more performant at scale for complex applications.</p><p>We reap performance benefits by running code on <a href=\"https://v8docs.nodesource.com/node-0.8/d5/dda/classv8_1_1_isolate.html\">V8 Isolates</a>, which are designed to start very quickly with minimal cold start times. Isolates are a technology built by the Google Chrome team to power the JavaScript engine in the browser, and they introduce a new model for running multi-tenant code. They provide lightweight contexts that group variables with the code allowed to mutate them.</p><p>Isolates are far more lightweight than containers, a central tenet of most other serverless providers’ architecture. Containers effectively run a virtual machine, and there’s a lot of overhead associated with them. That, in turn, makes it very hard to run the workload outside a centralized environment.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1GMRxjfSybfSIYGYmzpEiH/a36b5bafa3d383f794d1262b6d06e3f3/isolates-model_2x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"3762\" height=\"1882\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Moreover, a single process on Workers can run hundreds or thousands of isolates, making switching between them seamless. That means it is possible to run code from many different customers within a single operating system process. This low runtime overhead is part of the story of how Workers scales to support many tenants.</p><p>The other part of the story is code distribution. The ability to serve customers from anywhere in the world is a key difference between an edge-based and a region-based serverless paradigm, but it requires us to ship customer code to every server at once. Isolates come to the rescue again: we embed V8 with the same standard JavaScript APIs you can find in browsers, meaning a serverless edge application is both lightweight and performant. This means we can distribute Worker scripts to every server in every datacenter around the world, so that any server, anywhere, can serve requests bound for any customer.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-does-this-affect-my-bill\">How does this affect my bill?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-does-this-affect-my-bill\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Performance at scale is top of mind for us because improving performance on our Edge means we can pass those cost savings down to you.
