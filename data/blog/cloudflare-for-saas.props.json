SaaS providers can be anything from a web hosting provider to a subscription service, to an e-commerce platform. While well-known SaaS providers are industry giants, every day new SaaS companies are created, with the potential to become the next Salesforce.</p><p>But while it’s a fast-growing segment, if you’re a SaaS company, you know it’s not an easy path to forge.</p><p>Cloudflare <a href=\"/introducing-ssl-for-saas/\">released</a> a solution to help our SaaS customers four years ago — it’s called <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl-for-saas-providers/\">SSL for SaaS</a>. It’s perfect for those who need to manage their customers’ websites and SSL certificates at scale, and it’s been adopted by some of the leading SaaS companies in the world, from <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/wp-engine/\">WP Engine</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/shopify/\">Shopify</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/hubspot/\">HubSpot</a>. As the product has evolved, it has become a one-stop-shop for SaaS providers looking to provide fast load times, unparalleled redundancy, and the strongest security to their customers. Now, over 10 million applications have inherited the full benefits of the Cloudflare network through their SaaS provider.</p><p>Before today, SSL for SaaS was only available to Enterprise customers.

We are not going to tell you how to run your business, but we can share what we&#39;ve learned about the core infrastructure requirements — and how Cloudflare is well-positioned to address them.</p><p>Today, the way many SaaS providers offer their services is by giving their customers a web application that’s hosted on their origin (or, often, on Cloudflare).</p><p>Suppose you’re building a SaaS service for building e-commerce sites. You can give your customers a dedicated subdomain, like myshop.example.com, but it’s likely that your customers will come back asking to run the application on myshopsactualname.com. To give customers a branded experience, SaaS providers are required to support vanity domains.</p><p>This is more onerous than it sounds.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3cCTIET38bt2HSbMMpgzzL/81724e63a38f62ae157a123a70889568/image3-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1639\" height=\"1322\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Once an application has been spun up, the next step is to provision TLS certificates for both the SaaS provider’s application and their customers. Developers may start looking into building out their homespun solution where they have to architect a whole pipeline around making API calls to a Certificate Authority. That means validating certificates, renewing them, and storing them.  There are many states to account for in order to prevent certificate failures and uptime for your customers, which translates into a heavy engineering investment.</p><p>But here’s the thing: every hour of time you invest in doing this, is an hour that can’t be spent on engineering efforts to build out the core part of your business.</p><p>You don’t have to just take our word for it. In building SSL for SaaS, we got to learn from best-in-class engineering teams who were running into challenges managing complex certificate management systems. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/hubspot/\">HubSpot</a>, for example, rolled out their in-house solution in 2015 where they deployed SSL certificates that were shared amongst their customers. This became a short-term solution when they began to run into scaling difficulties, resulting in slow certificate deployment, and leaving their customers with an unsatisfactory experience.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"enter-ssl-for-saas\">Enter: SSL for SaaS</h3>\n      <a href=\"#enter-ssl-for-saas\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare has been focused on certificate provisioning and management for many years — it’s at the core of our business.

The Statusflare team has built out a solution that allows businesses to deploy global checks around the world to monitor uptime, metrics, and server response time. Beyond that, they allow their customers to deploy status pages, so their customers stay informed about the availability of their services.</p><p>When building out their status page product, the Statusflare team decided to use Workers as their deployment platform. This allowed them to spend all their time writing code and building out their API, and zero time worrying about deploying an origin server. Once the Statusflare team had finished building their application, they were ready to integrate it with their customers’ vanity domains, so that anyone could set up a status page for their website.</p><p>The challenge they then faced was getting their customers the latest version of their product. To start, they decided to open source their solution, give their customers the Workers script, and have their customers deploy it to get their status page up and running. But this makes updates complicated, and instead of giving their end-users the latest version, customers were now responsible for updates.</p><p>Not just that — they also had to spend time integrating with certificate authorities to issue certificates, so their customers’ pages stay protected.</p><p>Statusflare found that Cloudflare for SaaS was the perfect solution to help them grow. With easy-to-use integration for custom domains, all they now had to do was to click a few buttons, and their end-users could use a vanity domain, pull the latest update of the status page, and get a certificate deployed. Beyond that, Statusflare is now looking to integrate their solution with Cloudflare Access and Teams, so their customers can keep their monitoring private and only allow authorized users. With built-in security and rate limiting, Statusflare never has to worry about the number of incoming requests, or scaling their application. Statusflare was very excited to share that having everything in one place means that they don’t have to worry about scaling or provisioning servers, they don’t have to worry about the availability of their customer’s domains, and instead of investing time in keeping their application stable, they can now focus on writing code and building out their product.</p><blockquote><p>With Cloudflare, our application scales on its own, it scales to infinity.- <b>Adam, founder of Statusflare</b>.</p></blockquote>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"pluma-all-in-one-platform-for-publishing-blogs-and-podcasts\">PLUMA: All-in-One Platform for Publishing Blogs and Podcasts</h3>\n      <a href=\"#pluma-all-in-one-platform-for-publishing-blogs-and-podcasts\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><a href=\"https://pluma.cloud/\">PLUMA</a> is an audio hosting service, a blogging platform, and a privacy-focused analytics service for websites and mobile apps that is currently in the making.

With Workers KV, PLUMA is able to store all of its data, i.e. session data, static files, and logs, on Cloudflare’s edge, providing their end-users with a low latency service. One of the biggest requests from PLUMA users was for customers to be able to use their own branded domain, instead of one that PLUMA provides. With Cloudflare for SaaS, PLUMA can easily offer this experience to their end-users, with the extended benefit of keeping their customers’ sites secured with a TLS certificate.</p><blockquote><p>Cloudflare for SaaS makes it easy to integrate any number of domains with Workers. This makes Cloudflare a wonderful platform for building out low latency serverless applications.- <b>Pier Bover, founder of PLUMA</b></p></blockquote>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"plink-smart-links-for-podcasts\">Plink: Smart Links for Podcasts</h3>\n      <a href=\"#plink-smart-links-for-podcasts\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Plink makes universal links for podcasts.

With Workers and Workers KV, they were able to optimize their core scripts and functionality, without worrying about DevOps. This, coupled with Cloudflare for SaaS, allowed them to create a “custom-branded” experience of their service to external domains that were owned by their customers.</p><blockquote><p>Connecting Plink’s API with Cloudflare’s API has been a seamless experience.
