We are always on the lookout for ways to help save customers money. With that goal we <a href=\"/bandwidth-alliance/\">announced the Bandwidth Alliance with our founding partners</a> during our Birthday week.</p><p>The key concept of the Bandwidth Alliance is to help reduce and in many cases waive data transfer charges, sometimes known as &quot;bandwidth” or “egress” charges, for our mutual customers. We achieve this in partnership with the founding partners through strongly interconnected networks over peered connections. These connections typically occur within the same facility with no middleman. So, neither Cloudflare nor the cloud provider bears incremental costs. Further, we will also use our smart routing system (read details in this <a href=\"/smart-routing-for-bandwidth-alliance\">technical blog post</a>) to ensure that all our customers’ traffic on participating cloud providers, once their systems are set up, qualify for this offer.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4IW7BNIdmz5iOzpOnWZQYx/56754a2916bb0401cd9777a010930a9c/bandwidth-alliance-header_3x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1607\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"expanding-the-alliance-new-partners-committed-to-discounting-data-transfer-fees\">Expanding the Alliance: new Partners Committed to Discounting Data Transfer Fees</h4>\n      <a href=\"#expanding-the-alliance-new-partners-committed-to-discounting-data-transfer-fees\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We are proud to announce the following cloud providers and hosting companies have joined the Bandwidth Alliance in committing to zero data transfer fees for mutual customers.  Below is the list of companies from whom you’ll be able to get zero data transfer fees as a Cloudflare customer.

We are helping an initial set of customers use cloud storage with their Cloudflare service and zero data transfer fees.

Please read <a href=\"/bandwidth-alliance-partners-exciting-choices/\">this technical architecture post</a> by Kirk Schwenkler describing the considerations in enabling such a solution.</p><p>This is a starting point and we expect to be developing many reference architectures with our partners to allow our customers to have a truly best of breed option without any concerns on transfer fees.</p><p>Here is what the joining members say:</p><blockquote><p>“Open, affordable and free internet is what we strive for and what we give to our clients. Everyone and every company should have access to it. We are thrilled that the values shared by the Bandwidth Alliance can also be our values.”</p></blockquote><p>Marcin Kowalski, Senior Product Manager at Data Space</p><hr/><blockquote><p><i>&quot;DNSnetworks is proud to become a partner in Cloudflare’s initiative for a global bandwidth alliance.  Reducing the cost of bandwidth for partners and not-for-profit businesses fits into our mission of giving back to the community that has provided us with their business and trust.&quot;</i></p></blockquote><p>Kevin Conroy, VP Cloud Operations at DNSnetworks</p><hr/><blockquote><p><i>“At Host1Plus we believe in long-term connections.
