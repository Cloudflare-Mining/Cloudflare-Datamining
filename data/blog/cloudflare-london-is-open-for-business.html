	<p>CloudFlare's first international office opened this month near St. Paul's Cathedral in London. We decided to open an office outside Silicon Valley for two major reasons: to get access to high quality software engineering, network operations and technical support folks, and to expand our 24/7 operations and support. Not to mention, London has a vibrant start-up community that we are very happy to now be a part of.</p>
	<p>London is 8 hours ahead of San Francisco making it the perfect location for a hand-over from a team arriving at work at 0900 in California (the London team is nearing the end of the day at 1700). By extending working hours a little it's easy to get 24 hour operations and support with just two offices.</p>

	<p>And London's start-up community means there's a pool of talented people in engineering, operations and support for CloudFlare to hire from. Plus it enables CloudFlare to take part in the many <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/wordpress-london-meetup-january-2013">meetups</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/go-london-user-group">user groups</a> that flourish in and around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London_Tech_City">Tech City</a> some of which we sponsor.</p>
	<p>We choose to be in the St. Paul's area because of its good public transport links to all parts of London and because the building we are in has everything from a restaurant, sports club to state of the art bicycle storage. Near by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_New_Change">One New Change</a> and the surrounding area are full of shops and eateries. There's also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithfield_market#The_market">Smithfield Market</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbican">Barbican</a>.</p>
