Luxury Link has been using CloudFlare’s </i><a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/railgun/\"><i>Railgun acceleration technology</i></a><i> since March 2013.</i></p><p>In March 2013, we started testing Railgun, and slowly rolled it out across our three web properties. We saw immediate results.</p><p>First, we saw instant reductions in time to retrieve uncached HTML documents, and as an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/\">ecommerce web property</a> every millisecond counts. Using Railgun, the HTML for our home page (hosted in Los Angeles, California) loads 40 percent faster from the East Coast in the United States. Measurements we&#39;ve run from London showed a 2x speedup, which is invaluable in positioning ourselves as a global player in the travel industry.</p><p>Second, we saw a reduction in outbound bandwidth from our origin web servers. Because Railgun does compression between the origin server and CloudFlare’s data centers, our bandwidth needs were dramatically reduced. This is especially important for our business because sudden peaks of traffic are commonplace.</p><p>We had tried other dynamic acceleration products offered by top-tier CDNs, but the results weren&#39;t as good and they cost a lot more than the CloudFlare Business plan.</p><p>Railgun, to put it mildly, was rather impressive.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"bandwidth-before-and-after\">Bandwidth: Before and After</h3>\n            <a href=\"#bandwidth-before-and-after\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>We had the sneaking suspicion that Railgun&#39;s delta compression algorithm might have a noticeable impact on outbound bandwidth consumption out of our data center. In fact, it was more than noticeable!</p><p>In the chart below, the green line shows our outbound bandwidth consumption over a six month period. You can see that before we turned Railgun on in March, there are many spikes. Post-March, the spikes disappear.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4t1FdWM6x2riXcMBVLMfgs/c776a94ebddf03164adb3a2073fab1c6/6-months-before-after-Railgun.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>It is important to note that with or without Railgun enabled, all of our HTML documents are delivered using gzip encoding. All our images, stylesheets and scripts are cached in CloudFlare data centers; as such they barely factor in the outbound bandwidth consumption. It&#39;s for the most part fair to state that our outbound bandwidth consumption is solely comprised of the retrieval of uncached HTML documents.</p><p>For us, this is why Railgun makes such a difference on top of the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/\">traditional CDN benefits</a>. Railgun is accelerating and compressing the parts of the site that a normal CDN just can&#39;t handle. By accelerating the delivery of ‘uncacheable’ HTML pages, our visitors are getting better response times and we are seeing a big decrease in outbound bandwidth.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"bandwidth-before-railgun-inbound-vs-outbound-ratio\">Bandwidth Before Railgun: Inbound vs. Outbound Ratio</h3>\n            <a href=\"#bandwidth-before-railgun-inbound-vs-outbound-ratio\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>This chart shows the inbound (orange line) and outbound (green line) bandwidth on February 6, 2013, before we introduced Railgun.
