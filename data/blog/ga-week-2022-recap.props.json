Here’s that chart:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/09/image1-40.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Of course, that chart doesn’t show everything we’ve shipped, but the curve demonstrates a truth about a growing company: we keep shipping more and more products and services. Some of those things start with a beta, sometimes open and sometimes private. But all of them become generally available after the beta period.</p><p>Back in, say, 2014, we only had a few major releases per year. But as the years have progressed and the company has grown we have constant updates, releases and changes. This year a confluence of products becoming generally available in September meant it made sense to wrap them all up into GA Week.</p><p>GA Week has now finished, and the team is working to put the finishing touches on Birthday Week (coming this Sunday!), but here’s a recap of everything that we launched this week.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table style=\"font-size:16px\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>What launched</th>\n    <th>Summary</th>\n    <th>Available for?</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Monday (September 19)</td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudforce-one-is-now-ga/\">Cloudforce One</a></td>\n    <td>Our threat operations and research team, Cloudforce One, is now open for business and has begun conducting threat briefings.</td>\n    <td>Enterprise</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/domain-scoped-roles-ga/\">Improved Access Control: Domain Scoped Roles are now generally available</a></td>\n    <td>It is possible to scope your users’ access to specific domains with Domain Scoped Roles.

We’ll be shipping betas and making products generally available throughout the year. And we’ll continue iterating on our products so that all of them become leaders.</p><p><em>As we said at the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/welcome-to-ga-week/\">start of GA Week</a>: </em></p><blockquote><em>“But it’s not just about making products work and be available, it’s about making the best-of-breed. We ship early and iterate rapidly. We’ve done this over the years for WAF, DDoS mitigation, bot management, API protection, CDN and our developer platform. Today, analyst firms such as Gartner, Forrester and IDC recognize us as leaders in all those areas.”</em></blockquote><p>Now, onwards to Birthday Week!</p><h3 id=\"watch-on-cloudflare-tv\">Watch on Cloudflare TV</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://customer-rhnwzxvb3mg4wz3v.cloudflarestream.com/f6c2058c44f9977045d7a026ab8073ca/iframe?preload=true&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fcustomer-rhnwzxvb3mg4wz3v.cloudflarestream.com%2Ff6c2058c44f9977045d7a026ab8073ca%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D5s%26height%3D600&startTime=4s\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\" allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div><!--kg-card-end: html-->",
