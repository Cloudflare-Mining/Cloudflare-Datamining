		"html": "<p>Back in 2019, we worked on a chart for Cloudflare’s IPO S-1 document that showed major releases since Cloudflare was launched in 2010. Here’s that chart:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3mPxKF8Z2syd5Sf2UJUO5T/2666042b1453a079e62c8a0f85fe71a8/image1-40.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1870\" height=\"1590\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Of course, that chart doesn’t show everything we’ve shipped, but the curve demonstrates a truth about a growing company: we keep shipping more and more products and services. Some of those things start with a beta, sometimes open and sometimes private. But all of them become generally available after the beta period.</p><p>Back in, say, 2014, we only had a few major releases per year. But as the years have progressed and the company has grown we have constant updates, releases and changes. This year a confluence of products becoming generally available in September meant it made sense to wrap them all up into GA Week.</p><p>GA Week has now finished, and the team is working to put the finishing touches on Birthday Week (coming this Sunday!), but here’s a recap of everything that we launched this week.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table style=\"font-size:16px\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>What launched</th>\n    <th>Summary</th>\n    <th>Available for?</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Monday (September 19)</td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"/cloudforce-one-is-now-ga/\">Cloudforce One</a></td>\n    <td>Our threat operations and research team, Cloudforce One, is now open for business and has begun conducting threat briefings.</td>\n    <td>Enterprise</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"/domain-scoped-roles-ga/\">Improved Access Control: Domain Scoped Roles are now generally available</a></td>\n    <td>It is possible to scope your users’ access to specific domains with Domain Scoped Roles.
