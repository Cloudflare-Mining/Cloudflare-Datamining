The CA then sends us back a shared certificate covering the root (e.g. example.com) and top-level wildcard (e.g. *.example.com) of your domain, along with the hostnames of the other customers in the request. We then package this shared certificate with its encrypted private key and distribute it to our <a href=\"/amsterdam-to-zhuzhou-cloudflare-global-network/\">datacenters</a> around the world, ensuring that your visitors’ HTTPS sessions are speedy no matter where they originate.</p><p>Since that process was created, we have used it to secure millions of domains with free Universal SSL certificates and helped make the Internet a <a href=\"https://istlsfastyet.com/\">faster</a> and <a href=\"/introducing-tls-1-3/\">more secure</a> place.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"more-control-and-personalization\">More control and personalization</h2>\n            <a href=\"#more-control-and-personalization\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>But along the way we heard from customers who wanted more control over the certificates used for their domains.

By ordering a Dedicated Certificate you can be sure that only your hostnames appear on your certificate.</p><h4>Isolating certificates for agencies and SaaS providers</h4><p>Similarly, Dedicated Certificates allows agencies, SaaS providers, and other businesses to isolate their customers onto separate certificates—a must for those serving competitive firms in the same industry. If you currently serve customer1 and customer2 on a sub-domain of your zone, example.com, you can issue a separate certificate to each, guaranteeing that neither customers’ domain name appears on the other’s certificate.</p><h4>A branded HTTPS experience</h4><p>Universal SSL certificates are issued using a common name that is a concatenation of &quot;ssl&quot;, a six-digit sequence number, and “.cloudflaressl.com”. For example, ssl123456.cloudflaressl.com. With Dedicated Certificates you can use your domain name in this field, and be sure that no other domains—whether an unrelated site or yours or someone else’s—are ever shown to your visitors.</p><h4>Protecting multiple levels of subdomains</h4><p>Until today, if you had orange-clouded (proxied) entries in <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/\">DNS</a> for hosts such as <a href=\"http://www.staging.example.com\">www.staging.example.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.uat.example.com\">www.uat.example.com</a>, you would need a Business or Enterprise plan to avoid showing your users SSL errors (that may or may not be dismissible, depending on other security settings). Using Dedicated Certificates with Custom Hostnames you can now order a certificate protecting *.staging.example.com, *.uat.example.com—with room for up to 50 total hostnames or wildcards.</p><h4>Control over reissuance frequency</h4><p>Dedicated Certificates gives you control over how frequently you want their private keys to be regenerated and your certificate reissued. Want us to reissue your certificate immediately? Weekly? Simply delete it from the Edge Certificates table and request another one through our UI or API. You won’t be charged for the replacement unless you explicitly cancel your monthly subscription.</p><h4>Dedicated private keys for SSL in China (coming soon)</h4><p>Enterprise customers that want to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/china/\">serve SSL within China</a> may have concerns about using the same private key there as the one that secures their HTTPS traffic in other parts of the world. We’re looking forward to giving you control over designating a specific Dedicated SSL Certificate to be used exclusively in China.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"what-if-i-make-a-mistake-during-my-order\">What if I make a mistake during my order?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#what-if-i-make-a-mistake-during-my-order\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Not a problem.
