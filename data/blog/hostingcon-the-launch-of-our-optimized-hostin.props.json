We loved catching up with many of our existing partners and meeting potential new ones.</p><p>It&#39;s difficult to put such an exciting (and exhausting) week into words, especially when there was so much happening at the conference. Here&#39;s a summary of our HostingCon 2012 by the numbers...</p><ul><li><p><b>Limos:</b> On Sunday, we chauffeured nearly 200 HostingCon attendees to their hotels in style in our three black, stretch limos (CloudFlare: delivering you, fast and safe). We loved seeing the photos and tweets of the rides from our limo passengers, which made our 14 hours at all four terminals of Boston Logan International Airport fly by. We&#39;ll be back with our limos again next year, so be sure to look for our email to sign up.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/28k60xlczpdLRM0u8NKD03/0515d0fff824e95bb76ae5e1b817cb05/cflare-coffee2.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"HostingCon: The Launch of our Optimized Hosting Partners program, Railgun Nerf guns, Limos, Breakfast and much more!\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"349\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure></li><li><p><b>Breakfast:</b> We hosted three days of breakfast from Monday to Wednesday, preparing HostingCon attendees for their action-packed days on a full stomach. I especially liked our coffee cups: CloudFlare, delivering your coffee, fast and safe.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7kIibMqCCV3bofMbdGoGUW/39e4e6100f28356a4d7eb42e06068c5f/cflare-optimizedpartner2.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"HostingCon: The Launch of our Optimized Hosting Partners program, Railgun Nerf guns, Limos, Breakfast and much more!\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure></li><li><p><b>Optimized Hosting Partners:</b> Fun stuff aside, we also did some pretty serious work at HostingCon. We launched our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/hosting-partners/\">Optimized Hosting Partners Program</a>, allowing Optimized Hosts access to <a href=\"/cacheing-the-uncacheable-cloudflares-railgun-73454\">Railgun, our revolutionary new optimization product</a>, for free.

Our Optimized Hosting Partners are getting Railgun, so we brought you...real Railguns! The CloudFlare team worked hard over the weekend before HostingCon to box-and-unbox 500 Railgun Nerf guns for your pleasure. The Nerf guns were loaded with over 3,000 limited edition CloudFlare Optimized Nerf darts. We&#39;re really excited about Railgun (both the product and the Nerf version) and we hope you are too.</p></li></ul>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/15E0CCZHhNHDLOTlwC1EnQ/61d32d261e36a11b6650356aff342724/cflare-interviews.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"HostingCon: The Launch of our Optimized Hosting Partners program, Railgun Nerf guns, Limos, Breakfast and much more!\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><ul><li><p><b>Interviews:</b> Our co-founder, Michelle, conducted live interviews with 20 thought leaders in the hosting industry, including founders and executives. Who will be featured? Stay tuned in the next fewweeks to find out as we publish all of these videos online.</p></li><li><p><b>Panels:</b> Our other co-founder, Matthew, spoke on two panels during the conference on <i>Railgun&#39;s integration into our Optimized Hosting Partners Program</i> and <i>Technology Strategies and Practices for Defending Against DDoS Attacks.</i></p></li></ul>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/78lmiUFmx3bxYxORz2uXbC/8f10f7c3fc452078d14b6b05473db638/cflare-tshirts.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"HostingCon: The Launch of our Optimized Hosting Partners program, Railgun Nerf guns, Limos, Breakfast and much more!\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"336\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><ul><li><p><b>T-shirts:</b> We gave out hundreds of our latest CloudFlare t-shirt!
