The flexibility of remote work gives employees a chance to work from the towns where they grew up or countries they always wanted to visit. However, that distribution also presents compliance challenges.</p><p>Depending on your industry, keeping data inside of certain regions can be a compliance or regulatory requirement. You might require employees to connect from certain countries or exclude entire countries altogether from your corporate systems.</p><p>When we worked in physical offices, keeping data inside of a country was easy. All of your users connecting to an application from that office were, of course, in that country. Remote work changed that and teams had to scramble to find a way to keep people productive from anywhere, which often led to sacrifices in terms of compliance. Starting today, you can make geography-based compliance easy again in Cloudflare Access with just two clicks.</p><p>You can now build rules that require employees to connect from certain countries. You can also add rules that block team members from connecting from other countries.

Rather than trusting anyone on a private network, Access checks for identity any time someone attempts to reach an application. With Cloudflareâ€™s global network, that check takes place in a data center in over 200 cities around the world to avoid compromising performance.</p><p>Behind the scenes, administrators build rules to decide who should be able to reach the tools protected by Access. In turn, when users need to connect to those tools, they are prompted to authenticate with one of the identity provider options. Cloudflare Access checks their login against the list of allowed users and, if permitted, allows the request to proceed.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6eJU5IsZdyEbtOSfFhVbJi/4a513081c62cf1bb61677cfc5824f564/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1334\" height=\"844\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Cloudflare Access can check more than just their username.

Administrators build rules to determine which users can reach specific applications. Cloudflare Access integrates with your teamâ€™s identity provider, or even <a href=\"/multi-sso-and-cloudflare-access-adding-linkedin-and-github-teams/\">multiple identity providers</a>, to make those username-based decisions at the edge of our network.</p><p>However, identity consists of more than just a username. Cloudflare Access can aggregate multiple sources of signal in Cloudflare&#39;s network. Access can use that information to make a decision about identity in our network - long before that request ever reaches your infrastructure.</p><p>You can combine user rules with mutual TLS requirements, or <a href=\"/tanium-cloudflare-teams/\">device posture checks</a>, and even force logins to <a href=\"/require-hard-key-auth-with-cloudflare-access/\">always use a hard key</a>. All of these zero-trust rules run inline with Cloudflareâ€™s existing security features, like our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">WAF</a> and DDoS mitigation, to add layers of security to every request. The Cloudflare network gives your team a zero-trust platform to apply all of the data we can gather about a request to determine whether or not it should be allowed.</p><p>The country rules weâ€™re announcing today become another layer in that zero trust model. Like other sources of signal, you can combine these rules to build a comprehensive policy tailored to your organizationâ€™s compliance or security needs. For example, you can build a rule that only allows users to login to your application when they connect from Germany and use a physical hard key.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/17jM0dkytZjHIY5h8QAfXr/9bbad76eaf936b5df9d641b1da200c2f/Screen-Shot-2020-09-01-at-3.36.26-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1058\" height=\"817\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-to-get-started\">How to get started</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-to-get-started\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>To get started, navigate to an application you have added to Cloudflare Access or create a new one. Cloudflare Access policies consist of actions that can allow, block, or bypass requests based on the criteria defined. Access follows policies in order of precedence from top to bottom in the UI.</p><p>Inside of a policy you can define the criteria with three types of operators:</p><ul><li><p><b>Include</b>: Include rules function like OR operators. Users must meet at least one criterion in an Include rule. For example, an include rule can be constructed to allow anyone with @cloudflare.com email domains or <a href=\"mailto:user@team.com\">user@team.com</a> email domains to connect.</p></li><li><p><b>Require</b>: Require rules function like AND operators. Users must meet all Require rule criteria.</p></li><li><p><b>Exclude</b>: Exclusion rules function like &quot;NOT&quot; operators. Users must not meet the criterion of an Exclude rule.</p></li></ul><p>To require that users connect from a particular country, create an Allow policy that includes your users email or identity provider group.
