To counter this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later\">store-now/decrypt-later</a> threat, cryptographers have been hard at work over the last decades proposing and vetting post-quantum cryptography (PQC), cryptography that’s designed to withstand attacks of quantum computers. After a six-year public competition, in July 2022, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), known for standardizing AES and SHA, announced <a href=\"https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/index.shtml\">Kyber</a> as <a href=\"/nist-post-quantum-surprise/\">their pick</a> for post-quantum key agreement. Now the baton has been handed to Industry to deploy post-quantum key agreement to protect today’s communications from the threat of future decryption by a quantum computer.</p><p>Cloudflare operates as a reverse proxy between clients (“visitors”) and customers’ web servers (“origins”), so that we can protect origin sites from attacks and improve site performance. In this post we explain how we secure the connection from Cloudflare to <i>origin servers</i>. To put that in context, let’s have a look at the connection involved when visiting an uncached page on a website served through Cloudflare.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2WZQZByAjMmuu53BzxjNik/d2ffa03d42c004706f330d9dbc910ec2/Connections-involved-when-user-visits-an-uncached-page-on-a-website-served-through-Cloudflare.png\" alt=\"Connections involved when a user visits an uncached page on a website served through Cloudflare: 1. browser to edge; 2. internal connection(s); and 3. edge to customer origin server.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"417\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The first connection is from the visitor’s browser to Cloudflare.

However, it takes two to tango: the connection is only secured if the browser also supports post-quantum cryptography. As of August 2023, <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/protecting-chrome-traffic-with-hybrid.html\">Chrome</a> is slowly enabling <i>X25519+Kyber</i> by default.</p><p>The visitor’s request is routed through Cloudflare’s network (2).

Now, let’s dive in.</p><h2>Overview of a TLS 1.3 handshake</h2><p>To understand how a smooth upgrade is possible, and where it might go wrong, we need to understand a few basics of the TLS 1.3 protocol, which is used to protect traffic on the Internet. A TLS connection starts with a <b>handshake</b> which is used to authenticate the server and derive a shared key. The browser (client) starts by sending a <i>ClientHello</i> message that contains among other things, the hostname (SNI) and the list of key agreement methods it supports.</p><p>To remove a round trip, the client is allowed to make a guess of what the server supports and start the key agreement by sending one or more <i>client keyshares</i>. That guess might be correct (on the left in the diagram below) or the client has to retry (on the right). By the way, this guessing of keyshares is a <a href=\"/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3/\">new feature of TLS 1.3</a>, and it is the main reason why it’s faster than TLS 1.2.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/QbpgdMdMdt9aW2nmrBSnT/4b260dba5525453955aaba499a83e3a9/image2-30.png\" alt=\"Protocol flow for server-authenticated TLS 1.3 with a supported client keyshare on the left and a HelloRetryRequest on the right.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1726\" height=\"1346\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Protocol flow for server-authenticated TLS 1.3 with a supported client keyshare on the left and a</i> HelloRetryRequest <i>on the right.</i></p><p>In both cases the client sends a <i>client keyshare</i> to the server. From this client keyshare the server generates the <i>shared key</i>. The server then returns a <i>server keyshare</i> with which the client can also compute the shared key. This shared key is used to protect the rest of the connection using symmetric cryptography, such as AES.</p><p>Today <a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html\">X25519</a> is used as the key agreement in the vast majority of connections. To secure the connection against store-now/decrypt-later in the post-quantum world, a client can simply send a <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tls-westerbaan-xyber768d00/\">X25519+Kyber</a> keyshare.</p><h3>Hello! Retry Request? (HRR)</h3><p>What we just described is the happy flow, where the client guessed correctly which key agreement the server supports. If the server does not support the keyshare that the client sent, then the server picks one of the supported key agreements that the client advertised, and asks for it in a <i>HelloRetryRequest</i> message.</p><p>This is not the only case where a server can use a HelloRetryRequest: even if the client sent keyshares that the server supports, the server is allowed to prefer a different key agreement the client advertised, and ask for it with a HelloRetryRequest. This will turn out to be very useful.</p><p>_HelloRetryRequest_s are mostly undesirable: they add an extra round trip, and bring us back to the performance of TLS 1.2. We already had a transition of key agreement methods: back in the day P-256 was the de facto standard. When browsers couldn’t assume support for the newer X25519, some would send two keyshares, both X25519 and P-256 to prevent a <i>HelloRetryRequest</i>.</p><p>Also today, when enabling <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/protecting-chrome-traffic-with-hybrid.html\">Kyber in Chrome</a>, Chrome will send two keyshares: X25519 and X25519+Kyber to prevent a <i>HelloRetryRequest</i>. Sending two keyshares is not ideal: it requires the client to compute more, and it takes more space on the wire. This becomes more problematic when we want to send two post-quantum keyshares, as post-quantum keyshares are much larger. Talking about post-quantum keyshares, let’s have a look at X25519+Kyber.</p><h2>The nitty-gritty of X25519+Kyber</h2><p>The full name of the post-quantum key agreement we have enabled is <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tls-westerbaan-xyber768d00/\">X25519Kyber768Draft00</a>, which has become the industry standard for early deployment. It is the combination (a so-called <i>hybrid</i>, more about that later) of two key agreements: <a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html\">X25519</a> and a <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cfrg-schwabe-kyber/\">preliminary version</a> of NIST’s pick Kyber. Preliminary, because standardization of Kyber is not complete: NIST has released a <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd\">draft standard</a> for which it has requested public input. The final standard might change a little, but we do not expect any radical changes in security or performance. One notable change is the name: the NIST standard is set to be called <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd\"><i>ML-KEM</i></a>. Once ML-KEM is released in 2024, we will promptly adopt support for the corresponding hybrid, and deprecate support for X25519Kyber768Draft00. We will announce deprecation on this blog and <a href=\"https://pq.cloudflareresearch.com/\">pq.cloudflareresearch.com</a>.</p><h3>Picking security level: 512 vs 768</h3><p>Back in 2022, for incoming connections, <a href=\"/post-quantum-for-all/\">we enabled</a> hybrids with both Kyber512 and Kyber768. The difference is target security level: Kyber512 aims for the same security as AES-128, whereas Kyber768 matches up with AES-192. Contrary to popular belief, AES-128 is <a href=\"/nist-post-quantum-surprise/#grover-s-algorithm\">not broken</a> in practice by quantum computers.</p><p>So why go with Kyber768? After years of analysis, there is no indication that Kyber512 fails to live up to its target security level. The designers of Kyber feel more comfortable, though, with the wider security margin of Kyber768, and we follow their advice.</p><h3>Hybrid</h3><p>It is not inconceivable though, that an unexpected improvement in cryptanalysis will completely break Kyber768. Notably <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214.pdf\">Rainbow</a>, GeMMS and <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975\">SIDH</a> survived several rounds of public review before being broken. We do have to add nuance here. For a big break you need some mathematical trick, and compared to other schemes, SIDH had a lot of <i>mathematical attack surface</i>. Secondly, even though a scheme participated in many rounds of review doesn’t mean it saw a lot of attention. Because of their performance characteristics, these three schemes have more niche applications, and therefore received much less scrutiny from cryptanalysts. In contrast, Kyber is the big prize: breaking it will ensure fame.</p><p>Notwithstanding, for the moment, we feel it’s wiser to stick with hybrid key agreement. We combine Kyber together with X25519, which is currently the de facto standard key agreement, so that if Kyber turns out to be broken, we retain the non-post quantum security of X25519.</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>Kyber is fast. Very fast. It easily beats X25519, which is already known for its speed:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"tg\" style=\"width:100%\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>&nbsp;</th>\n\t\t\t<th>&nbsp;</th>\n\t\t\t<th colspan=\"2\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">Size keyshares(in bytes)</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th colspan=\"2\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">Ops/sec (higher is better)</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">Algorithm</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">PQ</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Client</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Server</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Client</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Server</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>X25519</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">❌</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">32</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">32</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">17,000</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">17,000</span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Kyber768</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">✅</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">1,184</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">1,088</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">31,000</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">70,000</span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>X25519Kyber768Draft00</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">✅</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">1,216</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">1,120</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">11,000</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000\">14,000</span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Combined X25519Kyber768Draft00 is slower than X25519, but not by much. The big difference is its size: when connecting the client has to send 1,184 extra bytes for Kyber in the first message. That brings us to the next topic.</p><h2>When things break, and how to move forward</h2><h3>Split ClientHello</h3><p>As we saw, the <i>ClientHello</i> is the first message that is sent by the client when setting up a TLS connection. With X25519, the ClientHello almost always fits within one network packet. With Kyber, the ClientHello doesn’t fit anymore with typical packet sizes and needs to be split over two network packets.</p><p>The TLS standard allows for the ClientHello to be split in this way. However, it used to be so exceedingly rare to see a split ClientHello that there is plenty of software and hardware out there that falsely assumes it never happens.</p><p>This so-called <b>protocol ossification</b> is the major challenge rolling out post-quantum key agreement. Back in 2019, during <a href=\"/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/\">earlier post-quantum experiments</a>, middleboxes of a particular vendor dropped connections with a split ClientHello. Chrome is currently <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/protecting-chrome-traffic-with-hybrid.html\">slowly ramping up</a> the number of post-quantum connections to catch these issues early. Several reports are listed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidcadrian/status/1692572405368078816\">here</a>, and luckily most vendors seem to fix issues promptly.</p><p>Over time, with the slow ramp up of browsers, many of these implementation bugs will be found and corrected. However, we cannot completely rely on this for our outbound connections since in many cases Cloudflare is the sole client to connect directly to the origin server. Thus, we must exercise caution when deploying post-quantum cryptography to ensure that we are still able to reach origin servers even in the presence of buggy implementations.</p><h3>HelloRetryRequest to the rescue</h3><p>To enable support for post-quantum key agreement on all outbound connections, without risking issues with split ClientHello for those servers that are not ready yet, we make clever use of HelloRetryRequest. Instead of sending a X25519+Kyber keyshare, we will only advertise support for it, and send a non-post quantum secure X25519 keyshare in the first ClientHello.</p><p>If the origin does not support X25519+Kyber, then nothing changes. One might wonder: could merely advertising support for it trip up any origins? This used to be a real concern in the past, but luckily browsers have adopted a clever mechanism called <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8701\">GREASE</a>: they will send codepoints selected from unpredictable regions to make it hard to implement any software that could trip up on unknown codepoints.</p><p>If the origin does support X25519+Kyber, then it can use the HelloRetryRequest to request a post-quantum key agreement from us.</p><p>Things might still break then: for instance a malfunctioning middlebox, load-balancer, or the server software itself might still trip over the large ClientHello with X25519+Kyber sent in response to the HelloRetryRequest.</p><p>If we’re frank, the HRR trick kicks the can down the road: we as an industry will need to fix broken hardware and software before we can enable post-quantum on every last connection. The important thing though is that those past mistakes will not hold us back from securing the majority of connections. Luckily, from our experience, breakage will not be common.</p><p>So, when you have flipped the switch on your origin server, and things do break against expectation, what could be the root cause?</p><h3>Debugging and examples</h3><p>It’s impossible to exhaustively list all bugs that could interfere with the post-quantum connection, but we like to share a few we’ve seen.</p><p>The first step is to figure out what pieces of hardware and software are involved in the connection. Rarely it’s just the server: there could be a load-balancer, and even a humble router could be at fault.</p><p>One straightforward mistake is to conveniently assume the ClientHello is small by reserving only a small, say 1000 byte, buffer.</p><p>A variation of this is where a server uses a single call to <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/recv.2.html\"><code>recv()</code></a> to read the ClientHello from the TCP connection. This works perfectly fine if it fits within one packet, but when split over multiple, it might require more calls.</p><p>Not all issues that we encountered relate directly to split ClientHello.

This can be done with the <code>bssl</code> tool of <a href=\"https://github.com/google/boringssl\">BoringSSL</a>:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">\t$ bssl client -connect (your server):443 -curves X25519:X25519Kyber768Draft00\n[...]\n\t  ECDHE curve: X25519Kyber768Draft00\n[...]</pre></code>\n            <p>If you set your zone to <code>supported</code> mode, or if you wait for the gradual roll-out, you will need to make sure that your origin server prefers post-quantum key agreement even if we sent a classical keyshare in the initial <i>ClientHello</i>. This can be done with <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/boringssl-pq\">our fork of BoringSSL</a>:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">\t$ git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/boringssl-pq\n\t[...]\n\t$ cd boringssl-pq &amp;&amp; cmake -B build &amp;&amp; make -C build\n$ build/bssl client -connect (your server):443 -curves X25519:X25519Kyber768Draft00 -disable-second-keyshare\n[...]\n\t  ECDHE curve: X25519Kyber768Draft00\n[...]</pre></code>\n            <h2>Scanning ahead to remove the extra roundtrip</h2><p>With the <i>HelloRetryRequest</i> trick today, we can safely advertise support for post-quantum key agreement to all origins. The downside is that for those origins that do support post-quantum key agreement, we’re incurring an extra roundtrip for the <i>HelloRetryRequest</i>, which hurts performance.</p><p>You can remove the roundtrip by configuring your zone as <code>preferred</code>, but we can do better: the best setting is the one you shouldn’t have to touch.</p><p>We have started scanning all active origins for support of post-quantum key agreement. Roughly every 24 hours, we will attempt a series of about ten TLS connections to your origin, to test support and preferences for the various key agreements.</p><p>Our preliminary results show that 0.5% of origins support a post-quantum connection. As expected, we found that a small fraction (&lt;0.34%) of all origins do not properly establish a connection, when we send a post-quantum keyshare in the first ClientHello, which corresponds to the <code>preferred</code> setting. Unexpectedly the vast majority of these origins do return a <i>HelloRetryRequest</i>, but fail after receiving the second ClientHello with a classical keyshare. We are investigating the exact causes of these failures, and will reach out to vendors to help resolve them.</p><p>Later this year, we will start using these scan results to determine the best setting for zones that haven’t been configured yet. That means that for those zones whose origins support it reliably, we will send a post-quantum keyshare directly without extra roundtrip.</p><h3>Also speeding up non post-quantum origins</h3><p>The scanner pipeline we built will not just benefit post-quantum origins. By default we send X25519, but not every origin supports or prefers X25519. We find that 4% of origin servers will send us a HelloRetryRequest for other key agreements such as P-384.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-color:#ccc;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{background-color:#fff;border-color:#ccc;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#333;\n  font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{background-color:#f0f0f0;border-color:#ccc;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#333;\n  font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-1wig{font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n</style>\n<table class=\"tg\" width=\"100%\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-1wig\"><span style=\"font-weight:700;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Key agreement</span></th>\n    <th class=\"tg-1wig\"><span style=\"font-weight:700;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Fraction supported</span></th>\n    <th class=\"tg-1wig\"><span style=\"font-weight:700;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">Fraction preferred</span></th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">X25519</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">96%</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">96%</span></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">P-256</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">97%</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">0.6%</span></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">P-384</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">89%</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">2.3%</span></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">P-521</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">82%</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">0.1%</span></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">X25519Kyber768Draft00</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">0.5%</span></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0lax\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:#000;background-color:transparent\">0.5%</span></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Also, later this year, we will use these scan results to directly send the most preferred keyshare to your origin removing the need for an extra roundtrip caused by HRR.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>To mitigate the <i>store-now/decrypt-later</i> threat, and ensure the Internet stays encrypted, the IT industry needs to work together to roll out post-quantum cryptography.
