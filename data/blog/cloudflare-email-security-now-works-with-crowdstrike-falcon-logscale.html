	<h3 id="how-cloudflare-email-works-with-falcon-logscale">How Cloudflare Email works with Falcon LogScale</h3>
	<p>Customers who have both Cloudflare Email Security and CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale can now send detection data to Falcon LogScale. Within Falcon LogScale, this detection information can be visualized and queried.</p>
	<p>To set up Cloudflare Email Security detections to flow into Falcon LogScale, navigate to the Settings section and choose the Marketplace tab in the lefthand toolbar, as shown in the screenshot below.</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image2.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1999" height="852"></figure>
	<p>After installing the package, an ingest token needs to be generated. Navigate to the “Ingest Tokens” tab under Settings and create one.</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image4-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1088" height="487"></figure>
	<p>Copy the ingest token to save it for later. From here, customers can navigate to the Cloudflare Email Security dashboard, go to the Settings section, select the Alert Webhooks tab and choose “+ New Webhook”. Then click the SIEM option, choose Other from the dropdown, and input the following information:</p>
	<p><strong>Auth Token: </strong>Bearer [INGEST TOKEN]<br><strong>Target: </strong>https://cloud.community.humio.com/api/v1/ingest/hec/raw</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-at-10.31.26.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1598" height="1006"></figure>
	<p>Customers can choose which events to send to Falcon LogScale by selecting the expanded option. In the screenshot above, the user has chosen to only send malicious and suspicious detections.</p>
	<p>A few minutes after creating a new webhook, Cloudflare Email Security will start sending detection data to the Falcon LogScale instance.</p>
	<p>When the Cloudflare Email Security package from the Falcon LogScale marketplace is installed, customers are provided with a parser for field extraction and out-of-box content through a dashboard. The parser allows the Falcon LogScale product to be able to query the detection data while the dashboard allows organizations to quickly get the relevant information about their email security. Below is what the dashboard looks like:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image3-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1999" height="754"></figure>
	<p>As you can see, we have included visualizations and queries to get teams up and running quickly, but it is meant to be a starting point for customers to build on. Customers can write their own queries and use them to create their own widgets. From there, they can create their own rendition of this dashboard to fit their needs.</p>
	<p>More information about setting up this integration can be found here: <a href="https://library.humio.com/integrations/integrations-cloudflare-package-area1.html" target="_blank">https://library.humio.com/integrations/integrations-cloudflare-package-area1.html</a></p>
	<h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What’s next</h3>
	<p>We are currently looking to expand the integration of Cloudflare products with Falcon LogScale. Our plan is to extend the integration to the remaining components of the Zero Trust Suite, enabling the relaying of logs and detection data to Falcon LogScale. This will allow customers to visualize and analyze data from these products, similar to the existing Cloudflare Email Security integration. If you are interested and would like to learn more, please reach out to your Cloudflare account contact.</p>
