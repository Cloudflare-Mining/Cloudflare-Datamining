Cloudflare’s network currently spans more than 310 cities in over 120 countries/regions, serving an average of over 50 million HTTP(S) requests per second for millions of Internet properties, in addition to handling over 70 million DNS requests per second on average. The data generated by this massive global footprint and scale, combined with data from complementary Cloudflare tools, enables Radar to provide unique near-real time perspectives on the patterns and trends we observe across the Internet. For the last several years (<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-radar-2020-year-in-review/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-radar-2021-year-in-review/\">2021</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2022-year-in-review/\">2022</a>), we’ve been aggregating these insights into an annual Year In Review, shining a light on the Internet’s patterns over the course of that year. The new <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023\">Cloudflare Radar 2023 Year In Review</a> continues that tradition, featuring interactive charts, graphs, and maps you can use to explore notable Internet trends observed throughout this past year.</p><p>The 2023 Year In Review is organized into three sections: <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/#traffic-insights-trends\">Traffic Insights &amp; Trends</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/#connectivity-speed\">Connectivity &amp; Speed</a>, and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/#security\">Security</a>. We have incorporated several new metrics this year, and have endeavored to keep underlying methodologies consistent with last year wherever possible. Website visualizations shown at a weekly granularity cover the period from January 2 through November 26, 2023. Trends for over 180 countries/regions are available on the website, with some smaller or less populated locations excluded due to insufficient data. Note that some of the metrics are presented only as a worldwide view, and will not be shown if a country/region is selected. Because of the<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-mortem-on-cloudflare-control-plane-and-analytics-outage/\"> control plane and analytics outage</a> that occurred November 2-4, traffic data for relevant metrics has been interpolated for that three-day period.</p><p>Below, we provide an overview of the content contained within the major Year In Review sections (<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review#trafficinsights\">Traffic Insights &amp; Trends</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review#connectivityspeed\">Connectivity &amp; Speed</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review#security\">Security</a>), along with notable observations and key findings. In addition, we have also published a companion blog post that specifically explores trends seen across <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review-internet-services/\">Top Internet Services</a>.</p><p>However, the notable observations and key findings contained within this post only skim the surface of the unique insights that can be found in the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023\">Year in Review website</a>, which we strongly encourage you to visit to explore the data in more detail and look at trends for your country/region.

A quarter-century later, we know that these claims were unrealistically aggressive, but it is clear that the Internet is growing quickly as more and more devices are connected, consuming content from a growing universe of websites, applications, and services.</p><p>To determine the traffic trends over time, we first established a baseline, calculated as the average daily traffic volume (excluding bot traffic) over the second full calendar week (January 8-14) of 2023. We chose the second calendar week to allow time for people to get back into their “normal” routines (school, work, etc.) after the winter holidays and New Year’s Day. The percent change shown in our traffic trends chart is calculated relative to the baseline value, and represents a seven-day trailing average — it does not represent absolute traffic volume for a country/region. The seven-day averaging is done to smooth the sharp changes seen with a daily granularity. A trend line for 2022 is shown for comparison purposes.</p><p>Our data shows that <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#internet-traffic-growth\">globally</a>, Internet traffic grew 25% in 2023, with nominal initial growth accelerating during the second half of the year. Overall, the pattern is similar to that observed in 2022 (excepting last year’s late February spike), and peak growth for the year is just slightly above the peak growth level seen in 2022. Traffic patterns in <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/ca#internet-traffic-growth\">Canada</a> were also rather consistent year-over-year, exhibiting similar seasonality, and peak growth above 30% in both 2022 and 2023. In many countries, the 2022 trend line shows a clear drop in traffic heading into the Christmas holiday, with a slight rebound ahead of New Year’s Day. It will be interesting to see if traffic follows this pattern in 2023 as well.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/22Bwlc7Vpahg5MjX92aRpl/00e621d4bb3a07fcf347b600b1c8fc9b/2.png\" alt=\"2\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1139\" height=\"588\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sub>Global Internet traffic growth in 2023, compared with 2022</sub></p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/Rl8Om7sRovHnaYbyjFfrO/eca8ebd341db1adc9f0c7b13e099e703/3.png\" alt=\"3\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1139\" height=\"588\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sub>Internet traffic growth in Canada in 2023, compared with 2022 </sub></p><p>Comparisons with 2022 traffic trends helps make the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/easter-passover-ramadan-internet-trends-2023/\">impact of major holidays on Internet traffic</a> more visible.

In order to make the amount of data used for the visualization manageable, IP addresses are aggregated at a <a href=\"https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/IPv4CIDRChart_2015.pdf\">/20</a> level, meaning that at the highest zoom level, each cell represents traffic from 4096 IPv4 addresses.

However, there are also a number of blocks that were assigned prior to the existence of the RIR system, and for these, they are labeled with the name of the organization that owns them. Progressive zooming ultimately shows the autonomous system and country/region that the IP address block is associated with, as well as its share of traffic relative to the maximum. (If a country/region is selected, only the IP address blocks associated with that location are visible.) Overall traffic shares are indicated by shading based on a color scale, and although a number of large unshaded blocks are visible, this does not necessarily mean that the associated address space is unused, but rather that it may be used in a way that does not generate traffic to Cloudflare.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1GzENc3bSTEAwo12YqzAz2/f7456e50b62ec0c892fee3f0b266643a/13.png\" alt=\"13\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"890\" height=\"879\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sub>Hilbert curve showing aggregated 2023 traffic to Cloudflare across the IPv4 Internet</sub></p><p>Areas of higher request volume, indicated by warmer orange/red shading, are visibly scattered throughout the plot, but the IP address block that had the maximum request volume to Cloudflare during 2023 was 66.249.64.0/20, which belongs to Google.

And over that time, available IPv4 space has been <a href=\"https://ipv4.potaroo.net/\">exhausted</a>, leading connectivity providers to resort to solutions like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation\">Network Address Translation</a>, and cloud and hosting providers to acquire blocks of IPv4 address space for <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/amazon-2bn-ipv4-tax-how-avoid-paying\">as much as $50 per address</a>. IPv6 also brings a number of other <a href=\"https://www.catchpoint.com/benefits-of-ipv6\">benefits</a> to network providers, and if implemented correctly, adoption should be transparent from an end user perspective.</p><p>Cloudflare has been a vocal and active advocate for IPv6 stretching all the way back to our first birthday in 2011, when we announced our <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa/\">Automatic IPv6 Gateway</a>, which enabled free IPv6 support for all of our customers. Just a few years later, we enabled <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/i-joined-cloudflare-on-monday-along-with-5-000-others\">IPv6 support by default for all of our customers</a>. (Although it is enabled by default, not all customers choose to keep it enabled for a variety of reasons.) However, this support is only half of the equation for driving IPv6 adoption, as end user connections need to support it as well. (Technically, it is a bit more complex than that, but those are the two foundational requirements.) Analysis of the IP version used for each request made to Cloudflare allows us to gain insight into the distribution of traffic by the various versions of the protocol, aggregated throughout the year.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage/as55836\">near-complete IPv6 adoption by Indian telecommunications provider Reliance Jio</a>, 70% of <a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/19025/dual-stack-network\">dual-stacked</a> requests from Indian users were made via IPv6. <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/in#ipv6-adoption\">India</a> was followed closely by <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/my#ipv6-adoption\">Malaysia</a>, where 66% of dual-stacked requests were made over IPv6 during 2023, thanks to strong IPv6 adoption rates across <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/my\">leading Internet providers</a> within the country. Other countries that saw more than half of dual-stacked requests, on average, made over IPv6 include <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/sa#ipv6-adoption\">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/vn#ipv6-adoption\">Vietnam</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/gr#ipv6-adoption\">Greece</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/fr#ipv6-adoption\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/uy#ipv6-adoption\">Uruguay</a>, and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/th#ipv6-adoption\">Thailand</a>. In contrast, there were on the order of 40 countries/regions where less than 1% of dual-stacked requests were made over IPv6 during 2023.

These included vulnerabilities in the Log4j Java-based logging utility, Microsoft Exchange, Atlassian’s Confluence platform, VMWare, and F5’s BIG-IP traffic management system. Although these are older vulnerabilities, attackers continued to actively target and exploit them throughout 2023, in part because organizations are frequently slow to follow the recommendations outlined in the Cybersecurity Advisory. We updated the analysis done for our blog post to include just the attack activity seen in 2023.</p><p>Attack activity by vulnerability varied by location, and in some, attacks targeted only a subset of the vulnerabilities. <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/#commonly-exploited-vulnerabilities\">Aggregated worldwide</a>, attack volume targeting Log4j consistently dwarfed that seen for the other vulnerabilities, and saw spikes during the last week of October and mid-late November; attack activity targeting Atlassian vulnerabilities increased in late July and trended slowly higher through the rest of the year.

The vulnerability (see <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44487\">CVE-2023-44487</a> for details) abuses an underlying weakness in the request cancellation feature of the HTTP/2 protocol, leading to resource exhaustion on the target web/proxy server. Between the end of August and the beginning of October, we saw a number of attacks targeting this vulnerability. Across this set of attacks, the average attack rate was 30M requests per second (rps), with nearly 90 peaking above 100M rps, and the largest one hitting 201M rps. This largest attack was nearly 3x bigger than our <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack/\">previous biggest attack on record</a>.</p><p>One notable concern about this vulnerability is that the attacker was able to generate such a large attack with a botnet consisting of just 20,000 compromised systems. This is much smaller than some of the largest botnets today, which comprise hundreds of thousands or millions of hosts. With average web traffic estimated to be between 1–3 billion requests per second, attacks using this method could conceivably focus an entire web’s worth of requests on a few unsuspecting targets.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2luQtFRyV3yEaFgsLT5IPa/894b0e673fb47e211446e2b6d69e5c35/26.png\" alt=\"26\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"515\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sub>HTTP/2 Rapid Reset campaign of hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks</sub></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"1-7-of-tls-1-3-traffic-is-using-post-quantum-encryption\">1.7% of TLS 1.3 traffic is using post-quantum encryption</h3>\n            <a href=\"#1-7-of-tls-1-3-traffic-is-using-post-quantum-encryption\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography\">Post-quantum</a> refers to a new set of cryptographic techniques that can protect data from adversaries with the ability to capture and store today&#39;s data for decryption by sufficiently powerful quantum computers in the future. The Cloudflare Research team has been <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/sidh-go/\">exploring post-quantum cryptography since 2017</a>.</p><p>In October 2022, we enabled <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all/\">post-quantum key agreement</a> at our edge by default, but use of it requires that the browser support it as well. Google&#39;s Chrome browser started to slowly enable support in August 2023, and we expect its support will continue to grow in 2024, and that other browsers will add support over time as well. In September 2023, we announced <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-cryptography-ga/\">general availability of post-quantum cryptography</a> for both inbound and outbound connections and for many internal services, and expect to finish upgrading all internal services by the end of 2024.</p><p>After first enabling support in August, Chrome began ramping the number of browsers (version 116 and later) that use post-quantum cryptography, resulting in gradual growth leading to the significant increase seen on November 8. These actions helped <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#post-quantum-encryption\">push the share</a> of TLS 1.3 traffic using post-quantum encryption to 1.7% at the end of November. As this ramp continues with future Chrome updates, and as other browsers add support for post-quantum encryption, we expect this share to continue to grow rapidly in 2024.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4NYxptRfJ89sfyulszrDer/9ead5d3068ba23be7206eefbcff01821/27.png\" alt=\"27\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1139\" height=\"569\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sub>Growth trends in post-quantum encrypted TLS 1.3 traffic</sub></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"deceptive-links-and-extortion-attempts-were-two-of-the-most-common-types-of-threats-found-in-malicious-email-messages\">Deceptive links and extortion attempts were two of the most common types of threats found in malicious email messages.</h3>\n            <a href=\"#deceptive-links-and-extortion-attempts-were-two-of-the-most-common-types-of-threats-found-in-malicious-email-messages\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As the #1 business application, email represents a very attractive entry point into enterprise networks for attackers.

By the end of October, and into November, the two threat categories had traded places, with nearly 80% of analyzed malicious emails containing an extortion threat, while only 20% contained deceptive links, as seen towards the right side of the graph below. However, this extortion campaign may have been short-lived, as its percentage fell almost as quickly as it rose.

However, because it relies on trust between networks, incorrect information shared between peers, whether done so intentionally or not, can send traffic to the wrong place, potentially with <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-leaks-and-crypto-currencies/\">malicious results</a>. <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/\">Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)</a> is a cryptographic method of signing records that associate a BGP route announcement with the correct originating AS number. In simple terms, it provides a way of ensuring that the information being shared originally came from a network that is allowed to do so. (Note that this is only half of the challenge of implementing routing security, as network providers also need to validate these signatures and filter out invalid announcements.) In the United States, the federal government recognizes the importance of routing security, with the Federal Communications Commission holding a <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/events/2023/07/bgp-security-workshop\">“Border Gateway Protocol Security Workshop”</a> on July 31.</p><p>Cloudflare has been a strong proponent of routing security, from being a founding participant in the <a href=\"https://www.manrs.org/2020/03/new-category-of-cdns-and-cloud-providers-join-manrs-to-improve-routing-security/\">MANRS CDN and Cloud Programme</a>, to releasing an <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-rpki-toolkit/\">RPKI toolkit</a> for network operators, to providing a <a href=\"https://isbgpsafeyet.com/\">public tool</a> that enables users to test whether their Internet provider has implemented BGP safely, to presenting at this summer’s FCC workshop.</p><p>Building on the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-routing/\">July release</a> of the new <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing\">Routing page</a> on Cloudflare Radar, we analyzed data from <a href=\"https://ftp.ripe.net/rpki/\">RIPE NCC&#39;s RPKI daily archive</a> to determine the share of RPKI valid routes (as opposed to those route announcements that are invalid or whose status is unknown) and how that share has changed over the course of 2023. Since the start of the year, the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/#routing-security\">global share of RPKI valid routes</a> grew to nearly 45%, up six percentage points from the end of 2022. At a country/region level, we are looking at routes announced by autonomous systems associated with the given country/region. In the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/us#routing-security\">United States</a>, the increased FCC attention on routing security is arguably warranted, as less than a third of the routes are RPKI valid. Although this is significantly better than <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/kr#routing-security\">South Korea</a>, where less than 1% of announced routes are RPKI valid, it trails <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/vn#routing-security\">Vietnam</a> significantly, where the share increased 35 percentage points during the first half of the year to 90%.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6h1rRaCe7tLAXIvEJh6328/e57b89cd46b6e461e3e4a5c612e91879/30.png\" alt=\"30\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1142\" height=\"560\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sub>RPKI valid route growth in Vietnam</sub></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n            <a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>In the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023\">Cloudflare Radar 2023 Year In Review</a>, we have attempted to provide a snapshot of the Internet, as dynamic as it is, through trend graphs and summary statistics, providing unique perspectives on Internet traffic, Internet quality, and Internet security, and how key metrics across these areas vary around the world.</p><p>As we said in the introduction, we strongly encourage you to visit the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023\">Cloudflare Radar 2023 Year In Review website</a> and explore the trends relevant to metrics, countries/regions, and industries of interest, and to consider how they impact your organization so that you are appropriately prepared for 2024.</p><p>If you have any questions, you can contact the Cloudflare Radar team at <a href=\"mailto:radar@cloudflare.com\">radar@cloudflare.com</a> or on social media at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar\">@CloudflareRadar</a> (X/Twitter), <a href=\"https://noc.social/@cloudflareradar\">https://noc.social/@cloudflareradar</a> (Mastodon), and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/radar.cloudflare.com\">radar.cloudflare.com</a> (Bluesky).</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n            <a href=\"#acknowledgements\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As we noted last year, it truly is a team effort to produce the data, website, and content for our annual Year in Review, and I’d like to acknowledge those team members that contributed to this year’s effort.
