Attempts to exploit multi-path opportunities are almost as old as the Internet, culminating in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2991\"><u>RFCs</u></a> documenting some of the challenges. Still, today, virtually all end-to-end communication uses only one available path at a time. Why? It turns out that in multi-path setups, even the smallest differences between paths can harm the connection quality due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-cost_multi-path_routing#History\"><u>packet reordering</u></a> and other issues. As a result, Internet devices usually use a single path and let the routers handle the path selection.</p><p>There is another way. Enter Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP), which exploits the presence of multiple interfaces on a device, such as a mobile phone that has both Wi-Fi and cellular antennas, to achieve multi-path connectivity.</p><p>MPTCP has had a long history — see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_TCP\"><u>Wikipedia article</u></a> and the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8684\"><u>spec (RFC 8684)</u></a> for details. It&#39;s a major extension to the TCP protocol, and historically most of the TCP changes failed to gain traction. However, MPTCP is supposed to be mostly an operating system feature, making it easy to enable. Applications should only need minor code changes to support it.</p><p>There is a caveat, however: MPTCP is still fairly immature, and while it can use multiple paths, giving it superpowers over regular TCP, it&#39;s not always strictly better than it. Whether MPTCP should be used over TCP is really a case-by-case basis.</p><p>In this blog post we show how to set up MPTCP to find out.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"subflows\">Subflows</h2>\n      <a href=\"#subflows\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3r8AP5BHbvtYEtXmYSXFwO/36e95cbac93cdecf2f5ee65945abf0b3/Screenshot_2024-12-23_at_3.07.37_PM.png\" alt=\"BLOG-2637 2\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1922\" height=\"1004\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Internally, MPTCP extends TCP by introducing &quot;subflows&quot;. When everything is working, a single TCP connection can be backed by multiple MPTCP subflows, each using different paths. This is a big deal - a single TCP byte stream is now no longer identified by a single 5-tuple. On Linux you can see the subflows with <code>ss -M</code>, like:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">marek$ ss -tMn dport = :443 | cat\ntcp   ESTAB 0  \t0 192.168.2.143%enx2800af081bee:57756 104.28.152.1:443\ntcp   ESTAB 0  \t0       192.168.1.149%wlp0s20f3:44719 104.28.152.1:443\nmptcp ESTAB 0  \t0                 192.168.2.143:57756 104.28.152.1:443</pre></code>\n            <p>Here you can see a single MPTCP connection, composed of two underlying TCP flows.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"mptcp-aspirations\">MPTCP aspirations</h2>\n      <a href=\"#mptcp-aspirations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Being able to separate the lifetime of a connection from the lifetime of a flow allows MPTCP to address two problems present in classical TCP: aggregation and mobility.</p><ul><li><p><b>Aggregation</b>: MPTCP can aggregate the bandwidth of many network interfaces. For example, in a data center scenario, it&#39;s common to use interface bonding. A single flow can make use of just one physical interface. MPTCP, by being able to launch many subflows, can expose greater overall bandwidth. I&#39;m personally not convinced if this is a real problem. As we&#39;ll learn below, modern Linux has a <a href=\"https://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/networking/networking2016/1570234725.pdf\"><u>BLESS-like MPTCP scheduler</u></a> and macOS stack has the &quot;aggregation&quot; mode, so aggregation should work, but I&#39;m not sure how practical it is. However, there are <a href=\"https://www.openmptcprouter.com/\"><u>certainly projects that are trying to do link aggregation</u></a> using MPTCP.</p></li><li><p><b>Mobility</b>: On a customer device, a TCP stream is typically broken if the underlying network interface goes away. This is not an uncommon occurrence — consider a smartphone dropping from Wi-Fi to cellular. MPTCP can fix this — it can create and destroy many subflows over the lifetime of a single connection and survive multiple network changes.</p></li></ul><p>Improving reliability for mobile clients is a big deal. While some software can use QUIC, which also works on <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-quic-multipath-11.html\"><u>Multipath Extensions</u></a>, a large number of classical services still use TCP. A great example is SSH: it would be very nice if you could walk around with a laptop and keep an SSH session open and switch Wi-Fi networks seamlessly, without breaking the connection.</p><p>MPTCP work was initially driven by <a href=\"https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html\"><u>UCLouvain in Belgium</u></a>. The first serious adoption was on the iPhone. Apparently, users have a tendency to use Siri while they are walking out of their home. It&#39;s very common to lose Wi-Fi connectivity while they are doing this.

After the initial TCP handshake, each peer may announce additional addresses (and ports) on which it can be reached. There are two ways of doing this. First, in the handshake TCP packet each peer specifies the &quot;<i>Do not attempt to establish new subflows to this address and port</i>&quot; bit, also known as bit [C], in the MPTCP TCP extensions header.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/bT8oz3wxpw7alftvdYg5n/b7614a4d10b6c81e18027f6785391ede/BLOG-2637_3.png\" alt=\"BLOG-2637 3\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1062\" height=\"252\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Wireshark dissecting MPTCP flags from a SYN packet. </i></sup><a href=\"https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/535\"><sup><i><u>Tcpdump does not report</u></i></sup></a><sup><i> this flag yet.</i></sup></p><p>With this bit cleared, the other peer is free to assume the two-tuple is fine to be reconnected to. Typically, the <b>server allows</b> the client to reuse the server IP/port address. Usually, the <b>client is not listening</b> and disallows the server to connect back to it. There are caveats though. For example, in the context of Cloudflare, where our servers are using Anycast addressing, reconnecting to the server IP/port won&#39;t work. Going twice to the IP/port pair is unlikely to reach the same server. For us it makes sense to set this flag, disallowing clients from reconnecting to our server addresses. This can be done on Linux with:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\"># Linux server sysctl - useful for ECMP or Anycast servers\n$ sysctl -w net.mptcp.allow_join_initial_addr_port=0\n</pre></code>\n            <p>There is also a second way to advertise a listening IP/port. During the lifetime of a connection, a peer can send an ADD-ADDR MPTCP signal which advertises a listening IP/port. This can be managed on Linux by <code>ip mptcp endpoint ... signal</code>, like:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\"># Linux server - extra listening address\n$ ip mptcp endpoint add 192.51.100.1 dev eth0 port 4321 signal\n</pre></code>\n            <p>With such a config, a Linux peer (typically server) will report the additional IP/port with ADD-ADDR MPTCP signal in an ACK packet, like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">host &gt; host: Flags [.], ack 1, win 8, options [mptcp 30 add-addr v1 id 1 192.51.100.1:4321 hmac 0x...,nop,nop], length 0\n</pre></code>\n            <p>It&#39;s important to realize that either peer can send ADD-ADDR messages. Unusual as it might sound, it&#39;s totally fine for the client to advertise extra listening addresses. The most common scenario though, consists of either nobody, or just a server, sending ADD-ADDR.</p><p>Technically, to launch an MPTCP socket on Linux, you just need to replace IPPROTO_TCP with IPPROTO_MPTCP in the application code:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">IPPROTO_MPTCP = 262\nsd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_MPTCP)\n</pre></code>\n            <p>In practice, though, this introduces some changes to the sockets API. Currently not all setsockopt&#39;s work yet — like <code>TCP_USER_TIMEOUT</code>. Additionally, at this stage, MPTCP is incompatible with kTLS.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"path-manager-scheduler\">Path manager / scheduler</h2>\n      <a href=\"#path-manager-scheduler\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Once the peers have exchanged the address information, MPTCP is ready to kick in and perform the magic.

Then, another component called &quot;scheduler&quot; is responsible for choosing a specific subflow to transmit the data over.</p><p>Both peers have a path manager, but typically only the client uses it. A path manager has a hard task to launch enough subflows to get the benefits, but not too many subflows which could waste resources.

The in-kernel path manager requires some configuration — it must know which IP addresses and interfaces are okay to start new subflows. This is configured with <code>ip mptcp endpoint ... subflow</code>, like:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">$ ip mptcp endpoint add dev wlp1s0 192.0.2.3 subflow  # Linux client\n</pre></code>\n            <p>This informs the path manager that we (typically a client) own a 192.0.2.3 IP address on interface wlp1s0, and that it&#39;s fine to use it as source of a new subflow. There are two additional flags that can be passed here: &quot;backup&quot; and &quot;fullmesh&quot;. Maintaining these <code>ip mptcp endpoints</code> on a client is annoying. They need to be added and removed every time networks change. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/networkmanager\"><u>NetworkManager</u></a> from 1.40 supports managing these by default. If you want to customize the &quot;backup&quot; or &quot;fullmesh&quot; flags, you can do this here (see <a href=\"https://networkmanager.dev/docs/api/1.44.4/settings-connection.html#:~:text=mptcp-flags\"><u>the documentation</u></a>):</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">ubuntu$ cat /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/95-mptcp.conf\n# set &quot;subflow&quot; on all managed &quot;ip mptcp endpoints&quot;. 0x22 is the default.\n[connection]\nconnection.mptcp-flags=0x22\n</pre></code>\n            <p>Path manager also takes a &quot;limit&quot; setting, to set a cap of additional subflows per MPTCP connection, and limit the received ADD-ADDR messages, like: </p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">$ ip mptcp limits set subflow 4 add_addr_accepted 2  # Linux client\n</pre></code>\n            <p>I experimented with the &quot;mobility&quot; use case on my Ubuntu 22 Linux laptop. I repeatedly enabled and disabled Wi-Fi and Ethernet. On new kernels (v6.12), it works, and I was able to hold a reliable MPTCP connection over many interface changes. I was <a href=\"https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/534\"><u>less lucky with the Ubuntu v6.8</u></a> kernel. Unfortunately, the <a href=\"https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/536\"><u>default path manager on Linux</u></a> client only works when the flag &quot;<i>Do not attempt to establish new subflows to this address and port</i>&quot; is cleared on the server. Server-announced ADD-ADDR don&#39;t result in new subflows created, unless <code>ip mptcp endpoint</code> has a <code>fullmesh</code> flag.</p><p>It feels like the underlying MPTCP transport code works, but the path manager requires a bit more intelligence. With a new kernel, it&#39;s possible to get the &quot;interactive&quot; case working out of the box, but not for the ADD-ADDR case. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"custom-path-manager\">Custom path manager</h2>\n      <a href=\"#custom-path-manager\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Linux allows for two implementations of a path manager component.

On those operating systems, path manager is not handled by the kernel, but instead can be an application responsibility. The exposed low-level API is based on <code>connectx()</code>. For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/network_cmds/blob/97bfa5b71464f1286b51104ba3e60db78cd832c9/mptcp_client/mptcp_client.c#L461\"><u>here&#39;s an example of obscure code</u></a> that establishes one connection with two subflows:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">int sock = socket(AF_MULTIPATH, SOCK_STREAM, 0);\nconnectx(sock, ..., &amp;cid1);\nconnectx(sock, ..., &amp;cid2);\n</pre></code>\n            <p>This powerful API is hard to use though, as it would require every application to listen for network changes. Fortunately, macOS and iOS also expose higher-level APIs. One <a href=\"https://github.com/mptcp-apps/mptcp-hello/blob/main/c/macOS/main.c\"><u>example is nw_connection</u></a> in C, which uses nw_parameters_set_multipath_service.</p><p>Another, more common example is using <code>Network.framework</code>, and would <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/majek/cb54b537c74506164d2a7fa2d6601491\"><u>look like this</u></a>:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">let parameters = NWParameters.tcp\nparameters.multipathServiceType = .interactive\nlet connection = NWConnection(host: host, port: port, using: parameters) \n</pre></code>\n            <p>The API supports three MPTCP service type modes:</p><ul><li><p><i>Handover Mode</i>: Tries to minimize cellular. Uses only Wi-Fi. Uses cellular only when <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102228\"><u>Wi-Fi Assist</u></a> is enabled and makes such a decision.</p></li><li><p><i>Interactive Mode</i>: Used for Siri.
