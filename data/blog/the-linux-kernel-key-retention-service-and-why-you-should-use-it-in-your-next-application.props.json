One of the consequences of incorrect memory accesses is leaking security data (including cryptographic keys). Cryptographic keys are just some (mostly random) data stored in memory, so they may be subject to memory leaks like any other in-memory data. The below example shows how a cryptographic key may accidentally leak via stack memory reuse:</p><p>broken.c</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-cpp\"><code class=\"language-cpp\">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;\n\nstatic void encrypt(void)\n{\n    uint8_t key[] = &quot;hunter2&quot;;\n    printf(&quot;encrypting with super secret key: %s\\n&quot;, key);\n}\n\nstatic void log_completion(void)\n{\n    /* oh no, we forgot to init the msg */\n    char msg[8];\n    printf(&quot;not important, just fyi: %s\\n&quot;, msg);\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    encrypt();\n    /* notify that we&#039;re done */\n    log_completion();\n    return 0;\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>Compile and run our program:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ gcc -o broken broken.c\n$ ./broken \nencrypting with super secret key: hunter2\nnot important, just fyi: hunter2</pre></code>\n            <p>Oops, we printed the secret key in the “fyi” logger instead of the intended log message! There are two problems with the code above:</p><ul><li><p>we didn’t securely destroy the key in our pseudo-encryption function (by overwriting the key data with zeroes, for example), when we finished using it</p></li><li><p>our buggy logging function has access to any memory within our process</p></li></ul><p>And while we can probably easily fix the first problem with some additional code, the second problem is the inherent result of how software runs inside the operating system.</p><p>Each process is given a block of contiguous virtual memory by the operating system. It allows the kernel to share limited computer resources among several simultaneously running processes. This approach is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory\">virtual memory management</a>. Inside the virtual memory a process has its own address space and doesn’t have access to the memory of other processes, but it can access any memory within its address space. In our example we are interested in a piece of process memory called the stack.</p><p>The stack consists of stack frames. A stack frame is dynamically allocated space for the currently running function. It contains the function’s local variables, arguments and return address. When compiling a function the compiler calculates how much memory needs to be allocated and requests a stack frame of this size. Once a function finishes execution the stack frame is marked as free and can be used again. A stack frame is a logical block, it doesn’t provide any boundary checks, it’s not erased, just marked as free. Additionally, the virtual memory is a contiguous block of addresses. Both of these statements give the possibility for malware/buggy code to access data from anywhere within virtual memory.</p><p>The stack of our program <code>broken.c</code> will look like:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><center><img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/52R3oh4H-57qkVChwuo3Ag/3526edee-ce7e-4f98-a2bf-ff1efd2fc800/public\"></center><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>At the beginning we have a stack frame of the main function. Further, the <code>main()</code> function calls <code>encrypt()</code> which will be placed on the stack immediately below the <code>main()</code> (the code stack grows downwards). Inside <code>encrypt()</code> the compiler requests 8 bytes for the <code>key</code> variable (7 bytes of data + C-null character). When <code>encrypt()</code> finishes execution, the same memory addresses are taken by <code>log_completion()</code>. Inside the <code>log_completion()</code> the compiler allocates eight bytes for the <code>msg</code> variable. Accidentally, it was put on the stack at the same place where our private key was stored before. The memory for <code>msg</code> was only allocated, but not initialized, the data from the previous function left as is.</p><p>Additionally, to the code bugs, programming languages provide unsafe functions known for the safe-memory vulnerabilities. For example, for C such functions are <code>printf()</code>, <code>strcpy()</code>, <code>gets()</code>. The function <code>printf()</code> doesn’t check how many arguments must be passed to replace all placeholders in the format string. The function arguments are placed on the stack above the function stack frame, <code>printf()</code> fetches arguments according to the numbers and type of placeholders, easily going off its arguments and accessing data from the stack frame of the previous function.</p><p>The NSA advises us to use safety-memory languages like Python, Go, Rust. But will it completely protect us?</p><p>The Python compiler will definitely check boundaries in many cases for you and notify with an error:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;x: {}, y: {}, {}&quot;.format(1, 2))\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nIndexError: Replacement index 2 out of range for positional args tuple</pre></code>\n            <p>However, this is a quote from one of 36 (for now) <a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-10210/opov-1/Python.html\">vulnerabilities</a>:</p><blockquote><p><i>Python 2.7.14 is vulnerable to a Heap-Buffer-Overflow as well as a Heap-Use-After-Free.</i></p></blockquote><p>Golang has its own list of <a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-14185/opov-1/Golang.html\">overflow vulnerabilities</a>, and has an <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/unsafe\">unsafe package</a>.

But, given the fact that cryptographic keys are much more valuable than the other data, can we do better protecting the keys at least?</p><p>As we already said, a memory address space is normally associated with a process. And two different processes don’t share memory by default, so are naturally isolated from each other. Therefore, a potential memory bug in one of the processes will not accidentally leak a cryptographic key from another process. The security of ssh-agent builds on this principle. There are always two processes involved: a client/requester and the <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-agent\">agent</a>.</p><blockquote><p><i>The agent will never send a private key over its request channel. Instead, operations that require a private key will be performed by the agent, and the result will be returned to the requester. This way, private keys are not exposed to clients using the agent.</i></p></blockquote><p>A requester is usually a network-facing process and/or processing untrusted input. Therefore, the requester is much more likely to be susceptible to memory-related vulnerabilities but in this scheme it would never have access to cryptographic keys (because keys reside in a separate process address space) and, thus, can never leak them.</p><p>At Cloudflare, we employ the same principle in <a href=\"/heartbleed-revisited/\">Keyless SSL</a>. Customer private keys are stored in an isolated environment and protected from Internet-facing connections.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"linux-kernel-key-retention-service\">Linux Kernel Key Retention Service</h3>\n            <a href=\"#linux-kernel-key-retention-service\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The client/requester and agent approach provides better protection for secrets or cryptographic keys, but it brings some drawbacks:</p><ul><li><p>we need to develop and maintain two different programs instead of one</p></li><li><p>we also need to design a well-defined-interface for communication between the two processes</p></li><li><p>we need to implement the communication support between two processes (Unix sockets, shared memory, etc.)</p></li><li><p>we might need to authenticate and support ACLs between the processes, as we don’t want any requester on our system to be able to use our cryptographic keys stored inside the agent</p></li><li><p>we need to ensure the agent process is up and running, when working with the client/requester process</p></li></ul><p>What if we replace the agent process with the Linux kernel itself?</p><ul><li><p>it is already running on our system (otherwise our software would not work)</p></li><li><p>it has a well-defined interface for communication (system calls)</p></li><li><p>it can enforce various ACLs on kernel objects</p></li><li><p>and it runs in a separate address space!</p></li></ul><p>Fortunately, the <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.0/security/keys/core.html\">Linux Kernel Key Retention Service</a> can perform all the functions of a typical agent process and probably even more!</p><p>Initially it was designed for kernel services like dm-crypt/ecryptfs, but later was opened to use by userspace programs. It gives us some advantages:</p><ul><li><p>the keys are stored outside the process address space</p></li><li><p>the well-defined-interface and the communication layer is implemented via syscalls</p></li><li><p>the keys are kernel objects and so have associated permissions and ACLs</p></li><li><p>the keys lifecycle can be implicitly bound to the process lifecycle</p></li></ul><p>The Linux Kernel Key Retention Service operates with two types of entities: keys and keyrings, where a keyring is a key of a special type. If we put it into analogy with files and directories, we can say a key is a file and a keyring is a directory. Moreover, they represent a key hierarchy similar to a filesystem tree hierarchy: keyrings reference keys and other keyrings, but only keys can hold the actual cryptographic material similar to files holding the actual data.</p><p>Keys have types. The type of key determines which operations can be performed over the keys. For example, keys of user and logon types can hold arbitrary blobs of data, but logon keys can never be read back into userspace, they are exclusively used by the in-kernel services.</p><p>For the purposes of using the kernel instead of an agent process the most interesting type of keys is the <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/asymmetric.7.html\">asymmetric type</a>. It can hold a private key inside the kernel and provides the ability for the allowed applications to either decrypt or sign some data with the key. Currently, only RSA keys are supported, but work is underway to add <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20221014100737.94742-2-ignat@cloudflare.com/\">ECDSA key support</a>.</p><p>While keys are responsible for safeguarding the cryptographic material inside the kernel, keyrings determine key lifetime and shared access. In its simplest form, when a particular keyring is destroyed, all the keys that are linked only to that keyring are securely destroyed as well. We can create custom keyrings manually, but probably one the most powerful features of the service are the “special keyrings”.</p><p>These keyrings are created implicitly by the kernel and their lifetime is bound to the lifetime of a different kernel object, like a process or a user. (Currently there are four categories of “implicit” <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/keyrings.7.html\">keyrings</a>), but for the purposes of this post we’re interested in two most widely used ones: process keyrings and user keyrings.</p><p>User keyring lifetime is bound to the existence of a particular user and this keyring is shared between all the processes of the same UID. Thus, one process, for example, can store a key in a user keyring and another process running as the same user can retrieve/use the key. When the UID is removed from the system, all the keys (and other keyrings) under the associated user keyring will be securely destroyed by the kernel.</p><p>Process keyrings are bound to some processes and may be of three types differing in semantics: process, thread and session. A process keyring is bound and private to a particular process. Thus, any code within the process can store/use keys in the keyring, but other processes (even with the same user id or child processes) cannot get access. And when the process dies, the keyring and the associated keys are securely destroyed. Besides the advantage of storing our secrets/keys in an isolated address space, the process keyring gives us the guarantee that the keys will be destroyed regardless of the reason for the process termination: even if our application crashed hard without being given an opportunity to execute any clean up code - our keys will still be securely destroyed by the kernel.</p><p>A thread keyring is similar to a process keyring, but it is private and bound to a particular thread. For example, we can build a multithreaded web server, which can serve TLS connections using multiple private keys, and we can be sure that connections/code in one thread can never use a private key, which is associated with another thread (for example, serving a different domain name).</p><p>A session keyring makes its keys available to the current process and all its children. It is destroyed when the topmost process terminates and child processes can store/access keys, while the topmost process exists. It is mostly useful in shell and interactive environments, when we employ the <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/keyctl.1.html\">keyctl tool</a> to access the Linux Kernel Key Retention Service, rather than using the kernel system call interface. In the shell, we generally can’t use the process keyring as every executed command creates a new process. Thus, if we add a key to the process keyring from the command line - that key will be immediately destroyed, because the “adding” process terminates, when the command finishes executing. Let’s actually confirm this with <code>[bpftrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace)</code>.</p><p>In one terminal we will trace the <code>[user_destroy](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/security/keys/user_defined.c#L146)</code> function, which is responsible for deleting a user key:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ sudo bpftrace -e &#039;kprobe:user_destroy { printf(&quot;destroying key %d\\n&quot;, ((struct key *)arg0)-&gt;serial) }&#039;\nAtt</pre></code>\n            <p>And in another terminal let’s try to add a key to the process keyring:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ keyctl add user mykey hunter2 @p\n742524855</pre></code>\n            <p>Going back to the first terminal we can immediately see:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">…\nAttaching 1 probe...\ndestroying key 742524855</pre></code>\n            <p>And we can confirm the key is not available by trying to access it:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ keyctl print 742524855\nkeyctl_read_alloc: Required key not available</pre></code>\n            <p>So in the above example, the key “mykey” was added to the process keyring of the subshell executing <code>keyctl add user mykey hunter2 @p</code>. But since the subshell process terminated the moment the command was executed, both its process keyring and the added key were destroyed.</p><p>Instead, the session keyring allows our interactive commands to add keys to our current shell environment and subsequent commands to consume them.

In addition, the <code>ssh-add-keyring.sh</code> will create a pseudo-private key file in <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa_keyring</code>, which needs to be passed to the main <code>ssh</code> process. It is a pseudo-private key, because it doesn’t have any sensitive cryptographic material. Instead, it only has the “myssh” identifier in a native OpenSSH format. If we use multiple SSH keys, we have to tell the main <code>ssh</code> process somehow which in-kernel key name should be requested from the system.</p><p>Before we start testing it, let’s make sure our SSH server (running locally) will accept the newly generated key as a valid authentication:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</pre></code>\n            <p>Now we can try to SSH into the system:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ SSH_AUTH_SOCK=&quot;&quot; ./ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_keyring localhost\nThe authenticity of host &#039;localhost (::1)&#039; can&#039;t be established.\nED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:3zk7Z3i9qZZrSdHvBp2aUYtxHACmZNeLLEqsXltynAY.\nThis key is not known by any other names.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes\nWarning: Permanently added &#039;localhost&#039; (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.\nLinux dev 5.15.79-cloudflare-2022.11.6 #1 SMP Mon Sep 27 00:00:00 UTC 2010 x86_64\n…</pre></code>\n            <p>It worked!

Although, this has a security downside - any process running as our user id will be able to access and use the key.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n            <a href=\"#summary\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In this post we learned about one of the most common ways that data, including highly valuable cryptographic keys, can leak.

There are still many Linux Kernel Key Retention Service features left untold, which might be a topic for another blog post. Stay tuned!</p>",
