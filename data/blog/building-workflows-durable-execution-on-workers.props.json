But writing any non-trivial application and making it <i>durable</i> in the face of failure is hard: this is where Workflows comes in. Workflows manages the retries, emitting the metrics, and durably storing the state (without you having to stand up your own database) as the Workflow progresses.</p><p>What makes Workflows different from other takes on “Durable Execution” is that we manage the underlying compute and storage infrastructure for you. You’re not left managing a compute cluster and hoping it scales both up (on a Monday morning) and down (during quieter periods) to manage costs, or ensuring that you have compute running in the right locations. Workflows is built on Cloudflare Workers — our job is to run your code and operate the infrastructure for you.</p><p>As an example of how Workflows can help you build durable applications, assume you want to post-process file uploads from your users that were uploaded to an R2 bucket directly via <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/presigned-urls/\"><u>a pre-signed URL</u></a>. That post-processing could involve multiple actions: text extraction via a <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/\"><u>Workers AI model</u></a>, calls to a third-party API to validate data, updating or querying rows in a database once the file has been processed… the list goes on.</p><p>But what each of these actions has in common is that it could <i>fail</i>. Maybe that upstream API is unavailable, maybe you get rate-limited, maybe your database is down. Having to write extensive retry logic around each action, manage backoffs, and (importantly) ensure your application doesn’t have to start from scratch when a later <i>step</i> fails is more boilerplate to write and more code to test and debug.</p><p>What’s a <i>step, </i>you ask? The core building block of every Workflow is the step: an individually retriable component of your application that can optionally emit state. That state is then persisted, even if subsequent steps were to fail. This means that your application doesn’t have to restart, allowing it to not only recover more quickly from failure scenarios, but it can also avoid doing redundant work. You don’t want your application hammering an expensive third-party API (or getting you rate limited) because it’s naively retrying an API call that you don’t have to.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint&lt;Env, Params&gt; {\n\tasync run(event: WorkflowEvent&lt;Params&gt;, step: WorkflowStep) {\n\t\tconst files = await step.do(&#039;my first step&#039;, async () =&gt; {\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\tinputParams: event,\n\t\t\t\tfiles: [\n\t\t\t\t\t&#039;doc_7392_rev3.pdf&#039;,\n\t\t\t\t\t&#039;report_x29_final.pdf&#039;,\n\t\t\t\t\t&#039;memo_2024_05_12.pdf&#039;,\n\t\t\t\t\t&#039;file_089_update.pdf&#039;,\n\t\t\t\t\t&#039;proj_alpha_v2.pdf&#039;,\n\t\t\t\t\t&#039;data_analysis_q2.pdf&#039;,\n\t\t\t\t\t&#039;notes_meeting_52.pdf&#039;,\n\t\t\t\t\t&#039;summary_fy24_draft.pdf&#039;,\n\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t});\n\n\t\t// Other steps...\n\t}\n}\n</pre></code>\n            <p>Notably, a Workflow can have hundreds of steps: one of the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/rules-of-workflows/\"><u>Rules of Workflows</u></a> is to encapsulate every API call or stateful action within your application into its own step. Each step can also define its own retry strategy, automatically backing off, adding a delay and/or (eventually) giving up after a set number of attempts.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">await step.do(\n\t&#039;make a call to write that could maybe, just might, fail&#039;,\n\t// Define a retry strategy\n\t{\n\t\tretries: {\n\t\t\tlimit: 5,\n\t\t\tdelay: &#039;5 seconds&#039;,\n\t\t\tbackoff: &#039;exponential&#039;,\n\t\t},\n\t\ttimeout: &#039;15 minutes&#039;,\n\t},\n\tasync () =&gt; {\n\t\t// Do stuff here, with access to the state from our previous steps\n\t\tif (Math.random() &gt; 0.5) {\n\t\t\tthrow new Error(&#039;API call to $STORAGE_SYSTEM failed&#039;);\n\t\t}\n\t},\n);\n</pre></code>\n            <p>To illustrate this further, imagine you have an application that reads text files from an R2 storage bucket, pre-processes the text into chunks, generates text embeddings <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/bge-large-en-v1.5/\"><u>using Workers AI</u></a>, and then inserts those into a vector database (like <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/\"><u>Vectorize</u></a>) for semantic search.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7b9m0rPDlGvIiTnhguyvzI/3f27678b141ce600f1f54eb999e9d671/WORKFLOWS.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2324\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>In the Workflows programming model, each of those is a discrete step, and each can emit state. For example, each of the four actions below can be a discrete <code>step.do</code> call in a Workflow:</p><ol><li><p>Reading the files from storage and emitting the list of filenames</p></li><li><p>Chunking the text and emitting the results</p></li><li><p>Generating text embeddings</p></li><li><p>Upserting them into Vectorize and capturing the result of a test query</p></li></ol><p>You can also start to imagine that some steps, such as chunking text or generating text embeddings, can be broken down into even more steps — a step per file that we chunk, or a step per API call to our text embedding model, so that our application is even more resilient to failure.</p><p>Steps can be created programmatically or conditionally based on input, allowing you to dynamically create steps based on the number of inputs your application needs to process. You do not need to define all steps ahead of time, and each instance of a Workflow may choose to conditionally create steps on the fly.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"building-cloudflare-on-cloudflare\">Building Cloudflare on Cloudflare</h2>\n      <a href=\"#building-cloudflare-on-cloudflare\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>As the Cloudflare Developer platform <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/birthday-week/\"><u>continues to grow</u></a>, almost all of our own products are built on top of it.

This section of the blog has two goals: to explain how we built it, and to demonstrate that anyone can create a complex application or platform with demanding requirements and multiple architectural layers on our stack, too.</p><p>If you’re wondering how Workflows manages to make durable execution easy, how it persists state, and how it automatically scales: it’s because we built it on Cloudflare Workers, including the brand-new <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/sqlite-in-durable-objects/\"><u>zero-latency SQLite storage we recently introduced to Durable Objects</u></a>.\n</p><p>To understand how Workflows uses Workers &amp; Durable Objects, here’s the high-level overview of our architecture:</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7pknYk0Sshxka3iPbxBCRj/bb8b75986601e38b6b69fe8d849c0cbe/image9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"895\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>There are three main blocks in this diagram:</p><p>The user-facing APIs are where the user interacts with the platform, creating and deploying new workflows or instances, controlling them, and accessing their state and activity logs. These operations can be executed through our public <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/\"><u>API gateway</u></a> using REST calls, a Worker script using bindings, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/wrangler3\"><u>Wrangler</u></a> (Cloudflare&#39;s developer platform command line tool), or via the <a href=\"https://dash.cloudflare.com/\"><u>Dashboard</u></a> user interface.</p><p>The managed platform holds the internal configuration APIs running on a Worker implementing a catalog of REST endpoints, the binding shim, which is supported by another dedicated Worker, every account controller, and their correspondent workflow engines, all powered by SQLite-backed Durable Objects. This is where all the magic happens and what we are sharing more details about in this technical blog.</p><p>Finally, there are the workflow instances, essentially independent clones of the workflow application. Instances are user account-owned and have a one-to-one relationship with a managed engine that powers them.

For example, take a look at how we implement the internal method getWorkflow():</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">async function getWorkflow(accountId: number, workflowName: string) {\n  try {\n    const res = this.ctx.storage.transactionSync(() =&gt; {\n      const cursor = Array.from(\n        this.ctx.storage.sql.exec(\n          `\n                    SELECT *,\n                    (SELECT class_name\n                        FROM   versions\n                        WHERE  workflow_id = w.id\n                        ORDER  BY created_on DESC\n                        LIMIT  1) AS class_name\n                    FROM   workflows w\n                    WHERE  w.name = ? \n                    `,\n          workflowName\n        )\n      )[0] as Workflow;\n\n      return cursor;\n    });\n\n    this.sendAnalytics(accountId, begin, &quot;getWorkflow&quot;);\n    return res as Workflow | undefined;\n  } catch (err) {\n    this.sendErrorAnalytics(accountId, begin, &quot;getWorkflow&quot;);\n    throw err;\n  }\n}\n</pre></code>\n            <p>The other thing we take advantage of in Workflows is using the recently <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/javascript-native-rpc/\"><u>announced</u></a> JavaScript-native RPC feature when communicating between components.</p><p>Before <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/\"><u>RPC</u></a>, we had to <code>fetch()</code> between components, make HTTP requests, and serialize and deserialize the parameters and the payload. Now, we can async call the remote object&#39;s method as if it was local. Not only does this feel more natural and simplify our logic, but it&#39;s also more efficient, and we can take advantage of TypeScript type-checking when writing code.</p><p>This is how the Configuration API would call the Account Controller’s <code>countWorkflows()</code> method before:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">const resp = await accountStub.fetch(\n      &quot;https://controller/count-workflows&quot;,\n      {\n        method: &quot;POST&quot;,\n        headers: {\n          &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json; charset=utf-8&quot;,\n        },\n        body: JSON.stringify({ accountId }),\n      },\n    );\n\nif (!resp.ok) {\n  return new Response(&quot;Internal Server Error&quot;, { status: 500 });\n}\n\nconst result = await resp.json();\nconst total_count = result.total_count;</pre></code>\n            <p>This is how we do it using RPC:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">const total_count = await accountStub.countWorkflows(accountId);</pre></code>\n            <p>The other powerful feature of our RPC system is that it supports passing not only <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm#supported_types\"><u>Structured Cloneable</u></a> objects back and forth but also entire classes.

However, state machines require an ahead-of-time understanding of the userland code, which implies having a build step before running them. This is costly at scale and introduces additional complexity.</p><p>A few iterations later, we had another idea. What if we could model the engine as a game loop?</p><p>Unlike other computer programs, games operate regardless of a user&#39;s input. The game loop is essentially a sequence of tasks that implement the game&#39;s logic and update the display, typically one loop per video frame. Here’s an example of a game loop in pseudo-code:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">while (game in running)\n    check for user input\n    move graphics\n    play sounds\nend while</pre></code>\n            <p>Well, an oversimplified version of our Workflow engine would look like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">while (last step not completed)\n    iterate every step\n       use memoized cache as response if the step has run already\n       continue running step or timer if it hasn&#039;t finished yet\nend while</pre></code>\n            <p>A workflow is indeed a loop that keeps on going, performing the same sequence of logical tasks until the last step completes.</p><p>The Engine and the instance run hand-in-hand in a one-to-one relationship. The first is managed, and part of the platform. It uses SQLite and other platform APIs internally, and we can constantly add new features, fix bugs, and deploy new versions, while keeping everything transparent to the end user. The second is the actual account-owned Worker script that declares the Workflow steps.</p><p>For example, when someone passes a callback into <code>step.do()</code>:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint&lt;Env, Params&gt; {\n  async run(event: WorkflowEvent&lt;Params&gt;, step: WorkflowStep) {\n    step.do(&#039;step1&#039;, () =&gt; { ... });\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>We switch execution over to the Engine. Again, this is possible because of the power of JS RPC. Besides passing Structured Cloneable objects back and forth, JS RPC allows us to <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/#send-functions-as-parameters-of-rpc-methods\"><u>create and pass entire application-defined classes</u></a> that extend the built-in RpcTarget. So this is what happens behind the scenes when your Instance calls <code>step.do()</code> (simplified):</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">export class Context extends RpcTarget {\n\n  async do&lt;T&gt;(name: string, callback: () =&gt; Promise&lt;T&gt;): Promise&lt;T&gt; {\n\n    // First we check we have a cache of this step.do() already\n    const maybeResult = await this.#state.storage.get(name);\n\n    // We return the cache if it exists\n    if (maybeValue) { return maybeValue; }\n\n    // Else we run the user callback\n    return doWrapper(callback);\n  }\n\n}\n</pre></code>\n            <p>Here’s a more complete diagram of the Engine’s <code>step.do()</code> lifecycle:</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4MymVGS7BxwityCRlWcBOX/136d4dcf0affce04164f87b6bbe8b12a/image5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"702\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Again, this diagram only partially represents everything we do in the Engine; things like logging for observability or handling exceptions are missing, and we don&#39;t get into the details of how queuing is implemented. However, it gives you a good idea of how the Engine abstracts and handles all the complexities of completing a step under the hood, allowing us to expose a simple-to-use API to end users.</p><p>Also, it&#39;s worth reiterating that every workflow instance is an Engine behind the scenes, and every Engine is an SQLite-backed Durable Object.

Workflows are typically long-lived processes that run multiple functions in sequence where anything can happen. Those functions can time out or fail because of a remote server error or a network issue and need to be retried. A workflow engine ensures that your application runs smoothly and completes regardless of the problems it encounters.</p><p>Durability means that if and when a workflow fails, the Engine can re-run it, resume from the last recorded step, and deterministically re-calculate the state from all the successful steps&#39; cached responses. This is possible because steps are stateful and idempotent; they produce the same result no matter how many times we run them, thus not causing unintended duplicate effects like sending the same invoice to a customer multiple times.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1R5UfQfNMKI7hB6QXJfCUr/242e85f2b5287394871e916844359bd4/image7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1074\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>We ensure durability and handle failures and retries by sharing the same technique we use for a <code>step.sleep()</code> that requires sleeping for days or months: a combination of using <code>scheduler.wait()</code>, a method of the <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/scheduling-apis\"><u>upcoming WICG Scheduling API</u></a> that we already <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/changelog/historical-changelog/#2021-12-10\"><u>support</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/alarms/\"><u>Durable Objects alarms</u></a>, which allow you to schedule the Durable Object to be woken up at a time in the future.</p><p>These two APIs allow us to overcome the lack of guarantees that a Durable Object runs forever, giving us complete control of its lifecycle.

You have the <b>errors</b>, <b>messages</b>, current <b>status</b>, and what happened with <b>every step</b>, all time stamped to the millisecond.</p><p>It&#39;s one thing to get data about a specific workflow instance, but it&#39;s another to zoom out and look at aggregated statistics of all your workflows and instances over time. Workflows data is available through our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/\"><u>GraphQL Analytics API</u></a>, so you can query it in aggregate and generate valuable insights and reports. In this example we ask for aggregated analytics about the wall time of all the instances of the “e-commerce-carts” workflow:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">{\n  viewer {\n    accounts(filter: { accountTag: &quot;febf0b1a15b0ec222a614a1f9ac0f0123&quot; }) {\n      wallTime: workflowsAdaptiveGroups(\n        limit: 10000\n        filter: {\n          datetimeHour_geq: &quot;2024-10-20T12:00:00.000Z&quot;\n          datetimeHour_leq: &quot;2024-10-21T12:00:00.000Z&quot;\n          workflowName: &quot;e-commerce-carts&quot;\n        }\n        orderBy: [count_DESC]\n      ) {\n        count\n        sum {\n          wallTime\n        }\n        dimensions {\n          date: datetimeHour\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</pre></code>\n            <p>For convenience, you can evidently also use Wrangler to describe a workflow or an instance and get an instant and beautifully formatted response:</p>\n
