The baseline for the values we use in the following charts is the average of the preceding week, except for the more granular minute by minute view that uses the traffic average of May 9 and 10 as baseline. To estimate the traffic to the several types of websites from the 40 participating countries, we use DNS name resolution data. In this blog post, we’re using CEST, Central European Summer Time.</p><p>It&#39;s not often that an entertainment event has an impact on a country’s Internet. So, was there an impact on Eurovision nights?</p><p>Let&#39;s start with aggregate Internet traffic to the 40 participant countries (Australia included). In the <b>first May 10 semi-final</b>, there seems to be a slight decrease in traffic during the contest — it makes sense if we think that most people were probably watching the broadcast on national TV (and not on YouTube, that was also transmitting live the event). Traffic was lower than in the previous period between 21:00 and 23:00 (the event was between 21:00 to 23:14), but it was back to normal at 23:00.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5rEKkCCASGoIQ0AOqAmHoT/05083cc5453e76e958bb7c6da1cd050f/image12.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1589\" height=\"652\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>For the second semi-final that trend is less clear. But the May 14 final (that lasted from 21:00 CEST to 01:10) told a different story. Traffic was 6% lower than on the previous Saturday after 21:00, mostly around 22:00, and after 23:15 it was actually higher (between 4% and 6%) than before and continued that way until 02:00.</p><p>What happened at that 23:15 time in Eurovision? The last of the 25 songs at the contest was Estonia’s “Hope”, by Stefan, and it ended at 23:14 (also in this blog post we will also see how 23:16 was the highest spike in terms of DNS traffic to fan websites during the final). This is the <b>Internet traffic in the participating countries on May 14</b> chart:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1if0eOWww5KwT6nsotpDFa/53d8112d2cf9f5d84fc24c731d330f90/image3-36.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>There were several countries that showed similar impact in terms of traffic change during at least the final.

Eurovision has many, some general (there’s the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGAE\">OGAE</a>, <i>General Organisation of Eurovision Fans</i>), others more local. And DNS traffic to them was clearly impacted.</p><p>The first semi-final, on May 10, had 33x more traffic than in the average of the previous week, with a clear 22:00 CEST spike. But the second semi-final, May 12, topped that, with 42x more traffic at the same time. The final, with the 25 finalists, clearly surpassed that and at 22:00 traffic was already 70x. But because the final was much longer (in the semi-finals it was around 23:00 that the finalists were announced), the peak was reached at 23:00, with 86x more traffic than usual.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2mDZ71yb3Sn4JpfknsDRSk/b6eeb1208c04a3bf94ebde6e78dd489d/image5-19.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><blockquote><p>“We have a winner.

DNS traffic to fan websites dropped from 86x to 45x at midnight, but it went up again to 49x more traffic when it was already 01:00 CEST in most of Europe and Ukraine was announced the winner of Eurovision 2022. This next chart shows Saturday’s May 14 <b>final traffic change to fan sites</b>:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3ulRUxcaBgKUVnjtOGmyvS/9b1919961c29c17ba4e3821b56c09c75/image14.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"983\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We can also clearly see that on Sunday morning, at 09:00, there was a 20x peak to fan sites, and also at 11:00 (17%).</p><p>Now, let’s go deeper by looking at a minute by minute view (the previous charts show hourly data) of DNS traffic to fan sites. In the two semi-finals it&#39;s easy to see that the moment the finalists were announced, and the event was ending, around 23:12, was when traffic was higher. Here’s what the May 10 (yellow) and May 12 (green) <b>two semi-finals fan sites growth</b> looked like:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5q20JtspYZJP7GxxWHkNUP/c11c163d37a6b0cca50721a3c19d50ad/image13.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"621\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We can also spot some highlights in fan sites during the semi-final besides the finalists&#39; announcement, which we saw were definitely the most popular moments of the two nights. First, on May 10 there was more traffic before the event (21:00) than on May 12, so people seem to have greater expectations of the first Eurovision 2022 event of the week. In terms of spikes (before the winners&#39; announcements), we created a list of moments in time with more interest to the fan websites and connected them to the events that were taking place at that time in Eurovision (ordered by impact):</p><p><b>First semi-final, May 10</b>#1. 22:47 Sum up of all the songs.#2. 22:25 Norway’s song (Subwoolfer, &quot;Give That Wolf a Banana&quot;).#3. 21:42 Bulgaria’s song (Intelligent Music Project, &quot;Intention&quot;).#4. 21:51 Moldova’s song (Zdob și Zdub and Advahov Brothers, &quot;Trenulețul&quot;).#5. 22:20 Greece’s song (Amanda Georgiadi Tenfjord, &quot;Die Together&quot;).</p><p><b>Second semi-final, May 12</b>#1. 21:22 Between Serbia (Konstrakta, &quot;In corpore sano&quot;) and Azerbaijan (Nadir Rustamli, &quot;Fade to Black&quot;).#2. 22:48 Voting period starts.#3. 22:30 Czech Republic’s song (We Are Domi, &quot;Lights Off&quot;).#4. 22:38 Laura Pausini &amp; Mika <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0NIA6ZYFus\">performing</a> (“Fragile” Sting cover song).#5. 22:21 Belgium’s song (Jérémie Makiese, &quot;Miss You&quot;).</p><p>How about the May 14 final?

Given that, we looked at DNS traffic to the video platforms in an aggregate for the 40 participating countries. So, was there an impact to this well known and high performing social and video platforms? The short answer is: yes.</p><p>The final was also the most evident example, especially after 23:15, when all the 25 finalists songs already performed and the event had two more hours of non-participant performances, video clips that summarize the songs and the voting process — the famous moment in Europe to find out who will get from each of the 40 participant countries the maximum of 12 points.</p><p>In this comparison between the semi-finals and final day, we can see how on May 10, the day of the first semi-final, <b>video platform traffic</b> had more growth before the contest started, which is not that surprising given that it was the first Eurovision 2022 event and there was perhaps curiosity to check who were the other contestants (by then Eurovision had videos of them all on YouTube).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1k2WNY7537aG6iiAp3KFxr/ce71a645d6d020b2e68256c7d07cc4aa/image4-29.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"597\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>But the May 14 final shows more DNS traffic growth than the other Eurovision days after 23:16 (as we saw before, that was the time when all the finalists&#39; songs had already been performed). The difference in traffic compared to the semi-finals was higher at 1:11 CEST. That was the moment that the final came to an end on Saturday night, and at that time it reached 31% more traffic to video platforms than on May 10, and 38% than on May 12.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"australias-impact-with-an-eight-hours-difference\">Australia’s impact (with an eight hours difference)</h3>\n            <a href=\"#australias-impact-with-an-eight-hours-difference\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Australia was one of the 40 participants, and it had a major time difference (there’s an eight-hour difference to CEST).
