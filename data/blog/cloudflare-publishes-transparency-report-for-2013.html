	<p>On January 27, the Department of Justice and the Director of National Intelligence <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/January/14-ag-081.html" target="_blank">announced</a> a change in rules governing the disclosure of National Security Orders, affording slightly more latitude in how companies could report the number of National Security Orders which they had received. Within several hours, CloudFlare presented its initial <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-transparency-report-on-national-security-orders">Transparency Report on National Security Orders</a>.</p>

	<p>Today, CloudFlare is publishing its first complete <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/transparency" target="_blank">Transparency Report</a> on governmental requests to coincide with <a href="https://www.trustycon.org/" target="_blank">TrustyCon</a>.</p>
	<p>The Transparency Report shows how many subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, pen register/trap and trace (PRTT) orders, and national security orders CloudFlare received and how many domains and accounts were affected by CloudFlare’s response those requests in 2013. The report does not include non-governmental requests.</p>
	<p>All totaled, the requests received affected fewer than 0.017% of the more than 2 million CloudFlare customers domains.</p>
