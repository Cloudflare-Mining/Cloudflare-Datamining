The TODAY Show is the top morning TV show in America, with more than 5 million viewers each day.</p><p>So, when the management team at <a href=\"http://www.khataland.com/\">Khataland.com</a> got the call that Jill Martin was going to feature one of their products in the Steals &amp; Deals promotion on Tuesday, January 24, they were excited.

So the team at Khataland got in touch with <a href=\"http://www.corecommerce.com/\">CoreCommerce</a>, who runs their online store, and made some plans to handle the expected surge.</p><p>Those plans quickly involved CloudFlare.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"working-together\">Working Together</h3>\n            <a href=\"#working-together\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>CloudFlare works in cooperation with any webserver or platform to make sure websites are safe, fast, and available. There&#39;s no relationship required between CloudFlare and your host, but it doesn&#39;t hurt that CloudFlare and CoreCommerce serve several customers together. For instance, earlier this month, <a href=\"http://benderbound.com/\">Benderbound</a> enjoyed the combination to make sure their site was fast and available during a smaller TODAY Show appearance.</p><p>So, when Khataland asked CoreCommerce for help, they recommended CloudFlare.</p><p>Here&#39;s how Brandon Wanamaker, from the quality assurance team, put it:</p><blockquote><p>We always do our best to provide top-tier service to our customers at the product and customer experience levels. CloudFlare allows us to multiply our efforts to speed up the software; reduces the merchant&#39;s expense by absorbing a very large majority of bandwidth usage; and protects higher profile, or otherwise unfortunate, targets of a denial of service attack and other malicious traffic. The more merchants on our system using CloudFlare, the faster and safer the CoreCommerce system is. Shoppers are less likely to abandon their shopping carts on a faster site. Merchants avoid huge bandwidth usage and possibly overages. Finally, it makes our lives a little easier when the system is running smoothly. It&#39;s changed how we handle stores featured on a national TV broadcast, with potential surge in traffic. We insist on CloudFlare to keep their stores and CoreCommerce running quickly, with no hiccups. With such huge exposure, downtime is not an option, and in every case, CloudFlare has never failed. And the setup is way too simple for something that does so much. Registration, a few clicks and you&#39;re done! I can&#39;t say enough good things about the experience the CoreCommerce team and our merchants have had working with CloudFlare.</p></blockquote>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"quick-setup-fantastic-results\">Quick Setup, Fantastic Results</h3>\n            <a href=\"#quick-setup-fantastic-results\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The team at Khataland signed up for CloudFlare directly, changed their nameservers, and ordered CloudFlare Pro to secure transactions with Full SSL.
