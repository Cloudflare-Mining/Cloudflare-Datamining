Most modern computers use a specification called Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI\">UEFI</a>) that defines a software interface between an operating system (e.g. Windows) and platform firmware (e.g. disk drives, video cards). There are security mechanisms built into UEFI that ensure that platform firmware can be cryptographically validated and boot securely through an application called a bootloader. This firmware is stored in non-volatile <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface\">SPI</a> flash memory on the motherboard, so it persists on the system even if the operating system is reinstalled and drives are replaced.</p><p>This creates a ‘trust anchor’ used to validate each stage of the boot process, but, unfortunately, this trust anchor is also a target for attack. In these UEFI attacks, malicious actions are loaded onto a compromised device early in the boot process. This means that malware can change configuration data, establish persistence by ‘<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/chinese-apt-deploy-moonbounce-malware-in-uefi-firmware/\">implanting</a>’ itself, and can bypass security measures that are only loaded at the operating system stage. So, while UEFI-anchored secure boot protects the bootloader from bootloader attacks, it does not protect the UEFI firmware itself.</p><p>Because of this growing trend of attacks, we began the process of <a href=\"/anchoring-trust-a-hardware-secure-boot-story/\">cryptographically signing our UEFI firmware</a> as a mitigation step. While our existing solution is platform specific to our x86 AMD server fleet, we did not have a similar solution to UEFI firmware signing for Arm. To determine what was missing, we had to take a deep dive into the Arm secure boot process.</p><p>Read on to learn about the world of Arm Trusted Firmware Secure Boot.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"arm-trusted-firmware-secure-boot\">Arm Trusted Firmware Secure Boot</h2>\n            <a href=\"#arm-trusted-firmware-secure-boot\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Arm defines a trusted boot process through an architecture called <a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0006/d\">Trusted Board Boot Requirements</a> (TBBR), or Arm Trusted Firmware (ATF) Secure Boot.

SCP will calculate the ROTPK hash and compare it against the burned OTP fuses. In the failure case, where the hash does not match, you will observe a failure as you saw earlier. If successful, the SCP firmware will proceed to boot the PMpro and SMpro. Both the PMpro and SMpro firmware will be verified and proceed with the ATF authentication flow.</p></li><li><p>The conclusion of the SCP authentication is the passing of the BL1 key to the first stage bootloader via the SCP HOB(hand-off-block) to proceed with the standard three stage bootloader ATF authentication mentioned previously.</p></li><li><p>At BL2, the dbb is read out of the secure variable storage and used to authenticate the BL33 certificate and complete the boot process by booting the BL33 UEFI image.</p></li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 56.85393258426966%;\"><iframe src=\"https://customer-eq7kiuol0tk9chox.cloudflarestream.com/b14f8722d5ae6b2727cc49638ec0b54a/iframe?preload=true&loop=true&autoplay=true&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fcustomer-eq7kiuol0tk9chox.cloudflarestream.com%2Fb14f8722d5ae6b2727cc49638ec0b54a%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D%26height%3D600\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\" allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"still-more-to-do\">Still more to do</h2>\n            <a href=\"#still-more-to-do\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>In recent years, management interfaces on servers, like the BMC, have been the target of cyber attacks including ransomware, implants, and disruptive operations. Access to the BMC can be local or remote. With remote vectors open, there is potential for malware to be installed on the BMC via network interfaces. With compromised software on the BMC, malware or spyware could maintain persistence on the server. An attacker might be able to update the BMC directly using flashing tools such as flashrom or socflash without the same level of firmware resilience established at the UEFI level.</p><p>The future state involves using host CPU-agnostic infrastructure to enable a cryptographically secure host prior to boot time. We will look to incorporate a modular approach that has been proposed by the Open Compute Project’s Data Center Secure Control Module Specification (DC-SCM) 2.0 <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/13BxuseSrKo647hjIXjp087ei8l5QQVb0/view\">specification</a>. This will allow us to standardize our Root of Trust, sign our BMC, and assign physically unclonable function (PUF) based identity keys to components and peripherals to limit the use of OTP fusing. OTP fusing creates a problem with trying to “e-cycle” or reuse machines as you cannot truly remove a machine identity.</p>",
