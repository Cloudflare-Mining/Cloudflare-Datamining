	<p>Cloudflare’s network spans more than 320 cities in over 120 countries, where we interconnect with over 13,000 network providers in order to provide a broad range of services to millions of customers. The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions. Thanks to <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Radar</a> functionality released earlier this year, we can explore the impact from a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/glossary/#bgp-announcements">routing</a> perspective, as well as a traffic perspective, at both a <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1768654743742579059">network</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1773704264650543416">location</a> level.</p>
	<p>As we have seen in previous years, nationwide exams take place across several MENA countries in the second quarter, and with them come <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#governmentdirected">government directed Internet shutdowns</a>. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#cablecuts">Cable cuts</a>, both terrestrial and submarine, caused Internet outages across a number of countries, with the ACE submarine cable being a particular source of problems. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#maintenance">Maintenance</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#poweroutages">power outages</a>, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#technicalproblems">technical problems</a> also disrupted Internet connectivity, as did <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#unknown">unknown</a> issues.

	<p>Each spring, governments in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region order local telecommunications providers to shut down or disrupt Internet connectivity across the country in an effort to prevent students from cheating on national secondary and high school exams. These shutdowns/disruptions generally occur for several hours per day over a multi-week period. We covered such events in <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/exam-internet-shutdowns-iraq-algeria">2023</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/syria-sudan-algeria-exam-internet-shutdown">2022</a>, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/syria-exam-related-internet-shutdowns">2021</a>, as they occurred in locations including Syria, Sudan, Algeria, and Iraq.</p>
	<p>In June, we published <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/syria-iraq-algeria-exam-internet-shutdown"><i>Exam-ining recent Internet shutdowns in Syria, Iraq, and Algeria</i></a>, which examined the daily Internet shutdowns that took place in Iraq and Syria, as well as the two multi-hour daily disruptions in Algeria, which appeared to be pursuing a content blocking strategy, rather than a full nationwide shutdown. The post examined the impact that these shutdowns have on Internet traffic, and also analyzed routing information and traffic from other Cloudflare services in an effort to better understand how these shutdowns are being implemented.</p>
	<p>In addition to the shutdowns covered in the previously referenced blog post, Iraq implemented a second round of shutdowns that started on June 23, and ran through at least July 14. Some of these shutdowns impacted the same set of networks seen in the first round, and some impacted networks in the autonomous Kurdistan region in the north.</p>
	<p>Among the latter set, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as206206">AS206206 (Kurdistan Net)</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as59625">AS59625 (Korek Telecom)</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as48492">AS48492 (IQ-Online)</a>, and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as21277">AS21277 (Newroz Telecom)</a> all implemented shutdowns on June 23, June 26, June 30, July 3, July 7, and July 10, between 06:00 - 08:00 local time (03:00 - 05:00 UTC).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-06-23&amp;dateEnd=2024-07-14&amp;location=as206206&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe>

	<p>Concerns over a potential Internet shutdown during planned protests against tax increases proposed in “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Finance_Bill_2024">Finance Bill 2024</a>” by the Kenyan government led to the publication of a joint statement signed by multiple organizations. The statement strongly urged the Kenyan government to refrain from enforcing any</p>
	<p>Internet shutdowns or information controls, and highlighted the “disastrous economic effects” such a move could have. In response, the Communications Authority of Kenya <a href="https://x.com/CA_Kenya/status/1805311316719993274">issued a press release</a> stating that “<i>For the avoidance of doubt, the Authority has no intention whatsoever to shut down Internet traffic or interfere with the quality of connectivity. Such actions would be a betrayal of the Constitution as a whole, the freedom of expression in particular and our own ethos.</i>”</p>

	<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Finance_Bill_protests">protests escalated</a> on June 25, Internet traffic in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ke">Kenya</a> dropped at 16:30 local time (13:30 UTC).

	<p>Similar concurrent drops in Internet traffic were observed in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/bi">Burundi</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ug">Uganda</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/rw">Rwanda</a>, and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/tz">Tanzania</a>, as shown below. Issues with submarine cables connected to one country can impact Internet connectivity in other countries if there is a dependency on that country/cable for upstream Internet connectivity. As such, the observed disruptions in those four countries were not that unusual. To that end, a (subsequently deleted) <a href="https://twitter.com/mtnug/status/1805707549385044057">post on X from MTN Uganda</a> noted: "<i>Our esteemed customers, We are experiencing a degraded service on all our internet services due to an outage caused by our connectivity supply through Kenya.

	<p>However, other participants in the Internet infrastructure community in Africa called the undersea cable outage explanation into question. Kyle Spencer, Executive Director of the <a href="https://www.uixp.co.ug">Uganda Internet eXchange Point</a>, <a href="https://x.com/kyleville/status/1805614461190906295">posted on X</a> that “<i>I am told the Kenyan government ordered sea cable landing stations to disconnect circuits.</i>” Ben Roberts, Group CTIO at <a href="https://liquid.tech">Liquid Intelligent Technologies</a> (a pan-African network infrastructure provider), <a href="https://x.com/benliquidkenya/status/1805851264082751756">posted</a> “<i>No cables are damaged this week.</i>” In addition, outages on undersea cables are rarely, if ever, resolved in a matter of hours, as this disruption was – they frequently last for days or weeks.</p>
	<p>On June 26, Safaricom’s CEO <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/sports/business/article/2001497896/why-there-was-network-outage-during-protests-safaricom-ceo-explains">claimed</a> “This outage was occasioned by reduced bandwidth on some cables that carry Internet traffic”, contradicting the company’s original claim. No additional information was forthcoming from Airtel or the Communications Authority of Kenya, but as noted above, some within the industry believe that the disruption that impacted connectivity in Kenya, Burundi, Uganda, Rwanda, and Tanzania was directed by the government of Kenya, and was not caused by submarine cable outages.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

	<p>On Sunday, May 12, issues with the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/eastern-africa-submarine-system-eassy">EASSy</a> and <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/seacomtata-tgn-eurasia">Seacom</a> submarine cables again disrupted connectivity to East Africa, impacting a number of countries previously affected by a set of cable cuts that occurred nearly three months earlier. Insight into these earlier cable cuts and the initial impact of May’s cable damage was covered in our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/east-african-internet-connectivity-again-impacted-by-submarine-cable-cuts"><i>East African Internet connectivity again impacted by submarine cable cuts</i></a> blog post.</p>
	<p>Traffic levels across a number of the impacted countries dropped just before 11:00 local time (08:00 UTC). &nbsp;The magnitude of the initial impact varied by country, with traffic initially dropping by 10-25% in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/ke?dateStart=2024-05-12">Kenya</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/ug?dateStart=2024-05-12">Uganda</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/mg?dateStart=2024-05-12">Madagascar</a>, and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/mz?dateStart=2024-05-12">Mozambique</a>, while traffic in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/rw?dateStart=2024-05-12">Rwanda</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/mw?dateStart=2024-05-12">Malawi</a>, and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/tz?dateStart=2024-05-12">Tanzania</a> dropped by one-third or more than compared to the previous week. The overall impact was most significant in Tanzania, Madagascar, and Rwanda, as seen in the graphs below.

	<p>A <a href="https://x.com/LeNdjam_Post/status/1794475979567505735">reported</a> fiber optic cable cut in Cameroon disrupted Internet connectivity for customers of <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as327802">Moov Africa TChad</a> on May 25. The outage lasted three hours, between 15:15 -18:15 local time (14:15 - 17:15 UTC), with the impact visible at a country level as well. Routing was disrupted too, as the number of IPv4 /24 prefixes (256 IPv4 addresses) announced by Moov Africa Tchad fell from eight to three during the disruption.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/BgpRoutesTimeseriesXY?dateStart=2024-05-25&amp;dateEnd=2024-05-25&amp;location=as327802&amp;chartState=%7B%22bgpSignalsMinMax%22%3Afalse%2C%22bgpSignalsIpVersionParam%22%3A%22ipv4%22%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Announced IP Address Space" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
	<p>The event was similar to one that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moovafrica.td/posts/pfbid0kB9W5CkhVJqBq34agPWqG81yeCfLBijKYc6WiLDKLE79nPmhie4T9idZVStc8f6Xl">occurred on January 10</a>, when Moov Africa Tchad and country-level traffic was disrupted for over 12 hours “due to a cut in the optical fiber coming from Cameroon through which Chad has access to the Internet”. During that event, significant volatility was also observed from a routing perspective, as the volume of announced IPv4 address space shifted frequently at a <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as327802?dateStart=2024-01-10&amp;dateEnd=2024-01-11">network</a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/td?dateStart=2024-01-10&amp;dateEnd=2024-01-11">country</a> level during the disruption. As we noted last quarter, as a landlocked country, Chad is dependent on terrestrial Internet connections to/through neighboring countries, and the <a href="https://afterfibre.nsrc.org">AfTerFibre cable map</a> illustrates Chad’s reliance on limited cable paths through Cameroon and Sudan.</p>

	<p>Above, we discussed an unexpected network interruption on the ACE submarine cable that caused outages across multiple countries on June 5. However, two months earlier, a planned outage for repair work on the cable also disrupted connectivity across multiple African countries. A <a href="https://twitter.com/jeanfrancis/status/1777231780002615593">communiqúe</a> issued by the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and the Digital Economy in Guinea noted in part (translated) “<i>...the ACE (Africa Coast to Europe) network will undergo a planned outage on April 8, 2024, between midnight and 2:00 a.m. morning in the following countries: Guinea, Senegal, Gambia, Sierra Leone and Liberia. This total outage of approximately 2 hours will affect Internet traffic and international calls.</i>”</p>
	<p>The graphs below show the impact to traffic in the listed countries for the planned two-hour repair window, though it appears that traffic did not return fully to expected levels after the repair window concluded – it is unclear why it remained slightly depressed. In addition, despite being listed as one of the impacted countries, no impact to traffic was observed in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/sn?dateStart=2024-04-07&amp;dateEnd=2024-04-08">Senegal</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-04-07&amp;dateEnd=2024-04-08&amp;location=lr&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

The graph below shows Ecuador’s Internet traffic dropping sharply just after 15:00 local time (20:00 UTC). A <a href="https://x.com/RobertoLuqueN/status/1803531032978661816">post on X from Public Works Minister Roberto Luque</a> explained (translated) “<i>The immediate report that we received from CENACE is that there is a failure in the transmission line that caused a cascade disconnection, so there is no energy service on a national scale.</i>” A subsequent post pointed at a lack of investment in the underlying systems, and noted that as of 18:41 pm local time (23:41 UTC), “<i>95% of the energy has already been restored</i>”. After the initial sharp drop, traffic began to recover fairly quickly, and was effectively back to expected levels by the stated time.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-06-19&amp;dateEnd=2024-06-20&amp;location=ec&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

	<p>A sudden increase in power consumption related to increased usage due to high temperatures, as well electrical systems being impacted by the heat, caused a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/power-blackout-hits-montenegro-bosnia-albania-croatias-adriatic-coast-2024-06-21">widespread power outage</a> across Montenegro, Bosnia, and Montenegro on June 21. The outage <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/several-countries-across-europe-have-been-hit-by-a-massive-power-cut/ar-BB1oDYDy">reportedly</a> originated in Montenegro after a 400-kilowatt transmission line exploded. While power outages are generally more localized to a single country, or region within a country, power distribution systems are linked across Balkan countries as part of the <a href="https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/electricity-corridor-western-balkans_en">Trans-Balkan Electricity Corridor</a>.</p>
	<p>Published reports (<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/several-countries-across-europe-have-been-hit-by-a-massive-power-cut/ar-BB1oDYDy">MSN</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/power-blackout-hits-montenegro-bosnia-albania-croatias-adriatic-coast-2024-06-21">Reuters</a>) noted that electrical networks went down 12:00 - 13:00 local time (10:00 - 11:00 UTC), and that electricity suppliers in the impacted countries started restoring power by mid-afternoon, and had it largely restored by the evening. The graphs below show traffic from Albania, Bosnia, and Montenegro starting to drop around 12:00 local time (10:00 UTC), reaching its nadir in Albania and Bosnia at 12:30 local time (10:30 UTC) and at 13:00 local time (11:00 UTC) in Montenegro. Traffic recovered gradually over the next several hours as power was restored, returning to expected levels by 15:30 local time (13:30 UTC).</p>
	<p>Croatia was reportedly impacted by the power outage as well, but <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/hr?dateStart=2024-06-21&amp;dateEnd=2024-06-21">no adverse impact to traffic</a> at a country level is visible during the timeframe that connectivity in the other countries was disrupted.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

	<p>During the two-plus years of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Ukraine’s power grid has been a frequent target for Russian air attacks. When damage to Ukraine’s electrical power infrastructure occurs as a result of these attacks, Internet connectivity is also disrupted. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-power-grid-russian-attacks-c763050237bcc1388747283bf336f8ad">Attacks on May 21</a> caused power outages across a number of areas in Ukraine. The most significant impact was in Sumy, where traffic dropped as low as 82% below the previous week at 00:00 on May 22 local time (21:00 UTC). As the graphs below illustrate, traffic was also lower than the previous week for several hours in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Vinnytsia, with traffic returning to expected levels by around 08:00 local time (05:00 UTC) on May 22.</p>

	<p>As we’ve covered in previous quarterly posts, Internet outages and disruptions aren’t always due to significant wide-scale events like severe weather, power outages, or cable cuts. Sometimes more mundane technical issues can cause problems when users try to access the Internet. One example of this occurred on April 15 in Malaysia, when customers of <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as9930">Time Internet</a> experienced a network outage for nearly two hours. The company explained the reason for the outage in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TimeInternet/posts/pfbid0RbJE44cgJvxA9FQSKFTVoe4NbJBdGuwkyXjuB5URiAW78zmgS5x1V8YPUt91ym9Al">contrite post on their Facebook page</a>, stating in part “<i>This Internet service outage was by far the worst in our history - affecting approximately 40% of our customers. … At 5.38pm today, both our primary and secondary Secure DNS servers became unreachable. This means that any browser or service requiring a DNS address resolution was not able to reach its intended site.</i>” Because subscribers could not reach Time Internet’s DNS resolvers, they were unable to resolve hostnames for Internet services, sites, and applications, including those delivered by Cloudflare. This resulted in the drop in traffic seen in the graph below, which started just after 17:00 local time (05:00 UTC), and began to recover approximately an hour later. The company did not provide any additional information on what caused the DNS servers to fail.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-04-15&amp;dateEnd=2024-04-15&amp;location=as9930&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

	<p>In Nepal, a number of local Internet service providers including <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as45650">AS45650 (Vianet)</a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as139922">AS139922 (Dishhome)</a> rely on Indian provider <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as9498">Bharti Airtel</a> for upstream connectivity, enabling them to reach the rest of the Internet. A <a href="https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/05/01/isps-warn-of-possible-internet-disruption">published report</a> underscores the reliance, noting “<i>Nepali ISPs buy 70 percent of their internet from Airtel.</i>”</p>
	<p>On April 25, these ISPs <a href="https://www.nepalitelecom.com/latest-internet-shutdown-saga-in-nepal">warned</a> that their services could be interrupted because the Nepali government had not provided them with foreign exchange services that would enable them to pay bandwidth vendors such as Airtel, whom they reportedly owed USD $30 million to. On May 1, Airtel informed the delinquent Nepali providers that Internet services may be interrupted at any time due to the overdue payment, and on May 2, Airtel took that step. The graphs below show Vianet’s traffic dropping to near zero at 16:15 local time (10:30 UTC), recovering to expected levels six hours later. An hour later, at 17:15 local time (11:30 UTC), Dishhome’s traffic dropped significantly, though not as severely as Vianet’s. Dishhome’s traffic also recovered approximately six hours later.</p>
	<p>Dishhome may not have experienced a near-complete outage like Vianet did because Bharti Airtel is one of <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as132799?dateStart=2024-05-02&amp;dateEnd=2024-05-02">four upstream providers used by its parent company</a>, whereas Bharti Airtel is <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as45650?dateStart=2024-05-02&amp;dateEnd=2024-05-02">one of Vianet's two upstream providers</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-05-02&amp;dateEnd=2024-05-02&amp;location=as139922&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
	<p>A month later, on June 3, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as45650">AS45650 (Vianet)</a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as17501">AS17501 (Worldlink)</a> in Nepal experienced Internet disruptions that were <a href="https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/internet-slowdown-across-nepal-due-to-airtel-network-issues">reportedly</a> caused by routing issues on Bharti Airtel’s network. On Worldlink, a drop in traffic occurred between 12:15 - 14:00 local time (06:30 - 08:15 UTC), while on Vianet, the loss of traffic took place between 12:15 - 13:15 local time (06:30 - 07:30 UTC).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

	<p>Most of the Internet disruptions covered in this blog post series have a known root cause, whether admitted/stated by the impacted provider(s) or closely associated with a real world event (severe weather, power outage, etc.) However, other disruptions are observed and even publicized by the impacted provider, but no underlying reason for the outage is ever made public.</p>

	<p>SpaceX Starlink’s satellite Internet service is unique in that it has an international subscriber base, so outages on its network have a more wide-reaching impact than issues with an ISP that covers a single country. At 01:59 UTC on May 29, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as14593">Starlink</a> <a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1795636172972314730">shared on X</a> that it was currently experiencing a network outage, and that it was actively implementing a solution. Twenty-eight minutes later, it <a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1795643144094285883">posted</a> “<i>The network issue has been fully resolved.</i>” This brief outage is visible in the graph below as a slight dip in traffic. However, what is particularly interesting is the spike in traffic to Cloudflare from Starlink’s network following the resolution of the outage. The sharp increase and rapid decline of the traffic curve after service was restored suggests that it may be related to an automated connectivity check of some kind, rather than pent-up user demand for content.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-05-28&amp;dateEnd=2024-05-29&amp;location=as14593&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

	<p>A near-complete Internet outage was observed in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/td">Chad</a> on June 5 between 08:15 - 12:00 local time (07:15 - 11:00 UTC), as seen in the graph below. Routing was also impacted, as the number of IPv4 /24 address blocks (256 IPv4 addresses) announced by network providers in the country dropped by as much as 75% during the outage.</p>
	<p>A <a href="https://fr.apanews.net/news/tchad-linternet-coupe-pendant-des-heures">news item covering the outage</a> noted that only Starlink subscribers retained Internet access during the outage. It also noted that Chad has faced recurring Internet disruptions since 2016, either because of problems with fiber-optic cables, or due to government directed shutdowns in the name of national security. It is unclear what ultimately caused this particular outage.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/BgpRoutesTimeseriesXY?dateStart=2024-06-05&amp;dateEnd=2024-06-05&amp;location=td&amp;chartState=%7B%22bgpSignalsMinMax%22%3Afalse%2C%22bgpSignalsIpVersionParam%22%3A%22ipv4%22%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Announced IP Address Space" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

	<p>As we become increasingly dependent on reliable Internet connectivity, we must recognize that that connectivity is itself reliant on a complex and interconnected foundation of physical, technical, and political factors. A failure in any one of these foundational components, whether due to a cable cut, power outage, misconfiguration, or government action, can have a significant impact, disrupting Internet connectivity for millions of users, potentially across multiple countries. While the resilience and reliability of the physical and technical components can be improved through redundancy and best practices, political factors have arguably proven to be the hardest to address. However, organizations like <a href="https://www.accessnow.org">AccessNow</a>, through their <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/campaign/keepiton">#KeepItOn</a> campaign, mobilize people, communities, and civil society actors globally to fight against government-directed Internet shutdowns, which can have <a href="https://pulse.internetsociety.org/en/netloss">significant financial consequences</a>.</p>
