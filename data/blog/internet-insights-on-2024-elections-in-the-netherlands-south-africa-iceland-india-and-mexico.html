	<p>2024 is being called by the <a href="https://time.com/6550920/world-elections-2024">media</a> “the” year of elections. More voters than ever are going to the polls in at least 60 countries for national elections, plus the 27 member states of the European Union. This includes eight of the world’s 10 most populous nations, impacting around half of the world’s population.</p>
	<p>To track and analyze these significant global events, we’ve created the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/elections-2024">2024 Election Insights</a> report on Cloudflare Radar, which will be regularly updated as elections take place.</p>
	<p>Our data shows that during elections, there is often a decrease in Internet traffic during polling hours, followed by an increase as results are announced. This trend has been observed before in countries like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/elections-france-2022">France</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-brazilian-presidential-elections-affected-internet-traffic">Brazil</a>, and more recently in Mexico and India — where elections were held between April 19 and June 1 in seven phases. Some regions, like <a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1748326986936635764">Comoros</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q1-2024-internet-disruption-summary#governmentdirected">Pakistan</a>, have experienced government-directed Internet disruptions around election time.</p>
	<p>Below, you’ll find a review of the trends we saw in elections in South Africa (May 29), to Mexico (June 2), India (April 19 - June 1) and Iceland (June 1). This includes election-related shifts in traffic, as well at attacks. For example, during the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/eu-elections-2024">European Parliament election</a> (June 6-9, 2024), <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dutch-political-websites-hit-by-cyber-attacks-as-eu-voting-starts">DDoS attacks targeted Dutch political websites</a> for two days, peaking at 73,000 requests per second.</p>
	<p>We’ll also be keeping an eye on upcoming elections. The United Kingdom recently scheduled its general election for July 4, making it the latest addition to the electoral calendar.</p>

	<p><b>Europe: 2024 European Parliament election (June 6-9)</b></p>
	<p>As mentioned above, we recently published a blog post about the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dutch-political-websites-hit-by-cyber-attacks-as-eu-voting-starts">cyber attack on Dutch political-related</a> websites. The 2024 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_European_Parliament_election">European Parliament election</a> started in the Netherlands on June 6, and continues through June 9 in the other 26 countries that are part of the European Union. Cloudflare observed DDoS attacks targeting multiple election or politically-related Internet properties on election day in the Netherlands, as well as the preceding day.</p>
	<p>The main June 5 DDoS attack on one of the websites peaked at 14:13 UTC (16:13 local time), reaching 73,000 requests per second (rps) in an attack that lasted for a few hours. This attack is illustrated by the blue line in the graph below, which shows that it ramped slowly over the first half of the day, and then appeared to abruptly stop at 18:06. And on June 6, the main attack on the second website peaked at 11:01 UTC (13:01 local time) with 52,000 rps.</p>

In March 2024, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/french-government-hit-with-cyberattacks-of-unprecedented-intensity">French government websites</a> faced attacks of “unprecedented intensity,” according to a spokesperson.

	<p><b>Mexico: Presidential, Senate, and Chamber of Deputies elections (June 2)</b></p>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Mexican_general_election">General elections</a> were held in Mexico on Sunday, June 2, 2024, resulting in the election of the first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum, from the Morena political party. Cloudflare data shows a typical election day pattern in Mexico, mirroring trends seen in other countries: when polling stations are open, HTTP requests dip below normal levels. On June 2, traffic decreased between 08:00 and 20:00 CST (14:00 and 02:00 UTC), gradually recovering afterward as polling stations closed at 18:00 CST. Throughout the day, traffic experienced drops of up to 11% at 09:30 and 13:00 CST, with daily traffic decreasing by 3%.</p>

	<p><b>India: General election (April 19 - June 1)</b></p>
	<p>In India, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Indian_general_election">general elections</a> were held from April 19 to June 1, 2024 in seven phases, with incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi winning by a smaller margin than in the previous election. More than 968 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion were eligible to vote, and there was a 66% <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/2024-lok-sabha-elections-voter-turnout-9376670">turnout</a>, making it the largest election in human history.</p>
	<p>Not all states voted on the same days, leading to mixed HTTP request patterns. On April 18, the day before the first election day, traffic was 10% higher than the previous week, marking the biggest increase of the year, something we’ve seen in other ​​elections.</p>

	<p>Some of the seven election days had a nationwide impact. Not all states in India voted on the same days. However, days with more constituencies or populous states participating saw bigger traffic changes. For example, May 7, 2024, saw 11 states, including the most populous ones, voting. This day (highlighted in the next chart) experienced the biggest nationwide drop in traffic, with a 6% decrease compared to the previous week. May 20 and May 25 also saw drops of 4% and 3%, respectively.</p>

	<p>The period between 15:30 and 19:30 local time (10:00 - 14:00 UTC) typically witnessed the most significant drop in traffic on election days.</p>
	<p>In Uttar Pradesh, the most populous Indian state, the first day of elections on April 19 saw the biggest drop (9%). May 20 and 25, with more constituencies voting, also experienced significant traffic drops, especially May 20, with traffic lower than usual between 10:30 and 22:30 UTC (05:00 - 17:00 UTC), and a 5% daily drop compared to the previous week.</p>
	<p>In Maharashtra, home to the capital Mumbai, May 20 saw the most impact, with a 17% drop in daily traffic compared to the previous week. On this day, traffic hit its lowest point at 14:30 local time (09:00 UTC), with a drop of approximately 20%.</p>

	<p><b>Iceland: Presidential election (June 1)</b></p>
	<p>Iceland held its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Icelandic_presidential_election">presidential election</a> on Saturday, June 1, 2024, and Halla Tómasdóttir was elected as the new president. She is the second woman to become president in Iceland and the fourth woman to hold a top leadership position, including prime ministers.</p>
	<p>In terms of HTTP requests, there wasn’t much change during election day. This might be because polling stations in Iceland were open from 09:00 to 22:00 local time (same as UTC), spreading out the impact. However, traffic increased the days before and after the election.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>On May 31, the day before the election, daily traffic in Iceland was 7% lower than the previous week. It remained stable on election day and increased by 14% on Sunday when results were announced. This increase was only surpassed by two days in 2024:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>May 2: +17%, driven by a 9% drop the previous week due to the national holiday, the first day of summer.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>March 19: +16%, due to a volcanic eruption that led to a <a href="https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2024/03/iceland-volcanic-eruption-ongoing-in-the-reykjanes-peninsula-as-of-march-19-update-1">state of emergency</a>, evacuations, and road closures.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Looking deeper into election day traffic with 15-minute granularity, traffic was around 12% lower between 14:00 and 16:00 local time (same as UTC), with the biggest drop, 20%, at 15:30.</p>

Our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2024-q1">DDoS threat report</a> for Q1 2024 gives a few recent examples. One notable case was the 466% surge in DDoS attacks on Sweden after its acceptance into the NATO alliance, mirroring the pattern observed during Finland’s NATO accession in 2023.</p>
	<p>Real-world conflicts and wars often lead to Internet pattern changes, disruptions, or cyberattacks.
