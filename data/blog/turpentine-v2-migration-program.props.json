That&#39;s why in late 2021 we introduced <a href=\"/announcing-turpentine/\">Turpentine</a>, a project to perform the process of translating the old Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) into Cloudflare Workers with just a push of a button. After nearly two years of testing and user feedback, we’ve tailored the migration processes for different user groups.</p><p>Today, we are thrilled to relaunch Turpentine, and introduce Cloudflare&#39;s new <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/migration-hub\">Migration Hub</a>. The Migration Hub serves as a one-stop-shop for all migration needs, featuring brand-new migration guides that bring transparency and simplicity to the process.</p><p>We also know that a large number of customers aren&#39;t comfortable doing migrations themselves. Years of built up business logic makes unpacking and translating CDN configurations between different vendors difficult and locks businesses into subpar products and services. To help these customers we have established a Professional Services group to ensure smooth migrations for customers transitioning to Cloudflare’s first-class products. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest resources in Turpentine to ensure that moving to any part of Cloudflare is easy and you have the help you need.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"why-choose-cloudflare\">Why choose Cloudflare?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#why-choose-cloudflare\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare has gained immense popularity among businesses seeking to improve website performance, security, and reliability. The demand for Cloudflare&#39;s CDN services has skyrocketed, with an ever-increasing number of companies wanting to use our services to help protect their web properties. It became evident that a more streamlined approach was needed to empower customers to self-guide through the onboarding process if they wanted.</p><p>That’s why we’ve shipped guides to help bring transparency to the migration process, compare Cloudflare&#39;s Rules or Workers to VCL or XML configurations, and provide mappings of different products between vendors. This resource serves as a repository of information and step-by-step guidance for those seeking to move to Cloudflare. These guides are designed to empower customers to take control of their onboarding journey by providing them with the tools and resources they need to understand how to successfully implement Cloudflare&#39;s first-class products without needing to talk to anyone.</p><p>As new features and enhancements are introduced to Cloudflare, the landing page will be updated to reflect these changes.</p><p>However, undertaking the onboarding process independently can be daunting for some businesses. We understand that every organization is unique, with specific requirements and challenges. To address this concern, Cloudflare has established a dedicated Professional Services team. This team of experts works closely with customers, taking the time to understand their environments, assess their needs, and provide tailored guidance and support throughout the migration process. With the help of the professional services team, businesses can transition to Cloudflare being guided by an experienced team to ensure a timely, smooth and successful migration. Using the Migration Hub, you can get in contact with the Professional Services team to help your migration journey.</p><p>Whether you prefer self-guided exploration or expert guidance, the Cloudflare Migration Hub has everything you need to make your migration journey a success.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"self-serve-guides\">Self-serve guides</h3>\n      <a href=\"#self-serve-guides\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Our commitment to transparency and empowering our customers led us to create comprehensive public-facing guides that provide valuable insights into how CDN products compare and overlap.

Using this information, migration should just be about matching up rules and implementing instead of translating feature names between vendors or fiddling with ChatGPT prompts to correctly (or incorrectly!) translate code from one vendor to the other.
