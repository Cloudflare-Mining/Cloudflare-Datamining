The name &quot;workerd&quot; (pronounced &quot;worker dee&quot;) comes from the Unix tradition of naming servers with a &quot;-d&quot; suffix standing for &quot;daemon&quot;. The name is not capitalized because it is a program name, which are traditionally lower-case in Unix-like environments.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><style>\n\t\tbutton {\n\t\t\tcolor: #ffffff;\n\t\t\tbackground-color: #1166ee;\n\t\t\tfont-size: 19px;\n\t\t\tborder: 1px solid #2d63c8;\n\t\t\tpadding: 15px 50px;\n\t\t\tcursor: pointer\n\t\t}\n\t\tbutton:hover {\n\t\t\tcolor: #ffffff;\n\t\t\tbackground-color: #377af6;\n\t\t}\n\t</style>\n\t<a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd\" open=\"_new\"><button type=\"button\" name=\"GitHubCTA\">Find the code on GitHub</button></a></p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"what-its-for\">What it&#39;s for</h2>\n            <a href=\"#what-its-for\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          \n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"self-hosting-workers\">Self-hosting Workers</h3>\n            <a href=\"#self-hosting-workers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>workerd can be used to self-host applications that you&#39;d otherwise run on Cloudflare Workers.

What does that mean?</p><p>Microservices have become popular over the last decade as a way to split monolithic servers into smaller components that could be maintained and deployed independently. For example, a company that offers several web applications with a common user authentication flow might have a separate team that maintains the authentication logic. In a monolithic model, the authentication logic might have been offered to the application teams as a library. However, this could be frustrating for the maintainers of that logic, as making any change might require waiting for every application team to deploy an update to their respective server. By splitting the authentication logic into a separate server that all the others talk to, the authentication team is able to deploy changes on their own schedule.</p><p>However, microservices have a cost. What was previously a fast library call instead now requires communicating over a network. In addition to added overhead, this communication requires configuration and administration to ensure security and reliability. These costs become greater as the codebase is split into more and more services. Eventually, the costs outweigh the benefits.</p><p>Nanoservices are a new model that achieve the benefits of independent deployment with overhead closer to that of library calls. With workerd, many Workers can be configured to run in the same process. Each Worker runs in a separate &quot;isolate&quot;, which gives the appearance of running independently of the others: each isolate loads separate code and has its own global scope. However, when one Worker explicitly sends a request to another Worker, the destination Worker actually runs in the same thread with zero latency. So, it performs more like a function call.</p><p>With nanoservices, teams can now break their code into many more independently-deployed pieces without worrying about the overhead.</p><p>(Some in the industry prefer to call nanoservices &quot;functions&quot;, implying that each individual function making up an application could be its own service. I feel, however, that this puts too much emphasis on syntax rather than logical functionality. That said, it is the same concept.)</p><p>To really make nanoservices work well, we had to minimize the baseline overhead of each service. This required designing workerd very differently from most other runtimes, so that common resources could be shared between services as much as possible. First, as mentioned, we run many nanoservices within a single process, to share basic process overhead and minimize context switching costs. A second big architectural difference between workerd and other runtimes is how it handles built-in APIs. Many runtimes implement significant portions of their built-in APIs in JavaScript, which must then be loaded separately into each isolate. workerd does not; all the APIs are implemented in native code, so that all isolates may share the same copy of that code. These design choices would be difficult to retrofit into another runtime, and indeed these needs are exactly why we chose to build a custom runtime for Workers from the start.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"homogeneous-deployment\">Homogeneous deployment</h3>\n            <a href=\"#homogeneous-deployment\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In a typical microservices model, you might deploy different microservices to containers running across a cluster of machines, connected over a local network. You might manually choose how many containers to dedicate to each service, or you might configure some form of auto-scaling based on resource usage.</p><p>workerd offers an alternative model: <b>Every machine runs every service.</b></p><p>workerd&#39;s nanoservices are much lighter-weight than typical containers. As a result, it&#39;s entirely reasonable to run a very large number of them – hundreds, maybe thousands – on a single server. This in turn means that you can simply deploy every service to every machine in your fleet.</p><p>Homogeneous deployment means that you don&#39;t have to worry about scaling individual services. Instead, you can simply load balance requests across the entire cluster, and scale the cluster as needed. Overall, this can greatly reduce the amount of administration work needed.</p><p>Cloudflare itself has used the homogeneous model on our network since the beginning. Every one of Cloudflare&#39;s edge servers runs our entire software stack, so any server can answer any kind of request on its own. We&#39;ve found it works incredibly well. This is why services on Cloudflare – including ones that use Workers – are able to go from no traffic at all to millions of requests per second instantly without trouble.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"capability-bindings-cleaner-configuration-and-ssrf-safety\">Capability bindings: cleaner configuration and SSRF safety</h3>\n            <a href=\"#capability-bindings-cleaner-configuration-and-ssrf-safety\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>workerd takes a different approach to most runtimes – indeed, to most software development platforms – in how an application accesses external resources.</p><p>Most development platforms start from assuming that the application can talk to the whole world. It is up to the application to figure out exactly what it wants to talk to, and name it in some global namespace, such as using a URL. So, an application server that wants to talk to the authentication microservice might use code like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Traditional approach without capability bindings.\nfetch(&quot;https://auth-service.internal-network.example.com/api&quot;, {\n  method: &quot;POST&quot;,\n  body: JSON.stringify(authRequest),\n  headers: { &quot;Authorization&quot;: env.AUTH_SERVICE_TOKEN }\n});</pre></code>\n            <p>In workerd, we do things differently. An application starts out with no ability to talk to the rest of the world, and must be configured with specific <i>capability bindings</i> that provide it access to <i>specific</i> external resources. So, an application which needs to be able to talk to the authentication service would be configured with a binding called authService, and the code would look something like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Capability-based approach. Hostname doesn&#039;t matter; all\n// requests to AUTH_SERVICE.fetch() go to the auth service.\nenv.AUTH_SERVICE.fetch(&quot;https://auth/api&quot;, {\n method: &quot;POST&quot;,\n body: JSON.stringify(authRequest),\n});</pre></code>\n            <p>This may at first appear to be a trivial difference. In both cases, we have to use configuration to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-access-control/\">control access</a> to external services. In the traditional approach, we&#39;d provide access tokens (and probably the service&#39;s hostname) as environment variables. In the new approach, the environment goes a bit further to provide a full-fledged object. Is this just syntax sugar?</p><p>It turns out, this slight change has huge advantages:</p><p>First, we can now restrict the global fetch() function to accept only publicly-routable URLs. <b>This makes applications totally immune to SSRF attacks!</b> You cannot trick an application into accessing an internal service unintentionally if the code to access internal services is explicitly different. (In fact, the global fetch() is itself backed by a binding, which can be configured. workerd defaults to connecting it to the public internet, but you can also override it to permit private addresses if you want, or to route to a specific proxy service, or to be blocked entirely.)</p><p>With that done, we now have an interesting property: All internal services which an application uses <i>must</i> be configurable. This means:</p><ul><li><p>You can easily see a complete list of the internal services an application talks to, without reading all the code.</p></li><li><p>You can always replace these services with mocks for testing purposes.</p></li><li><p>You can always configure an application to authenticate itself differently (e.g. client certificates) or use a different back end, without changing code.</p></li></ul><p>The receiving end of a binding benefits, too. Take the authentication service example, above. The auth service may be another Worker running in workerd as a nanoservice. In this case, the auth service does not need to be bound to any actual network address. Instead, it may be made available strictly to other Workers through their bindings. In this case, the authentication service doesn&#39;t necessarily need to verify that a request received came from an allowed client – because only allowed clients are able to send requests to it in the first place.</p><p>Overall, capability bindings allow simpler code that is secure by default, more composable, easier to test, and easier to understand and maintain.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"always-backwards-compatible\">Always backwards compatible</h3>\n            <a href=\"#always-backwards-compatible\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Cloudflare Workers has a hard rule against ever breaking a live Worker running in production.
