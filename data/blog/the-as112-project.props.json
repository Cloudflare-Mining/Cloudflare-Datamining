In the seven days leading up to publication of this blog post, for example, Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 resolver received more than 98 billion of these queries -- <i>all of which have no useful answer in the </i><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/\"><i>Domain Name System</i></a>.</p><p>Some history is useful for context. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are essential to network communication. Many networks make use of IPv4 addresses that are reserved for private use, and devices in the network are able to connect to the Internet with the use of network address translation (NAT), a process that maps one or more local private addresses to one or more global IP addresses and vice versa before transferring the information.</p><p>Your home Internet router most likely does this for you. You will likely find that, when at home, your computer has an IP address like 192.168.1.42. That’s an example of a private use address that is fine to use at home, but can’t be used on the public Internet. Your home router translates it, through NAT, to an address your ISP assigned to your home and that can be used on the Internet.</p><p>Here are the reserved “private use” addresses designated in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918\">RFC 1918</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table width=\"100%\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Address block</th>\n    <th>Address range</th>\n    <th>Number of addresses</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>10.0.0.0/8</td>\n    <td>10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255</td>\n    <td>16,777,216</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>172.16.0.0/12</td>\n    <td>172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255</td>\n    <td>1,048,576</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>192.168.0.0/16</td>\n    <td>192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255</td>\n    <td>65,536</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<center><small>(Reserved private IPv4 network ranges)</small></center><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Although the reserved addresses themselves are blocked from ever appearing on the public Internet, devices and programs in private environments may occasionally originate DNS queries corresponding to those addresses.

It is a query to look up the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/\">domain name</a> associated with a given IP address, in particular those addresses associated with routers and switches. For example, network administrators and researchers use reverse lookups to help understand paths being taken by data packets in the network, and it’s much easier to understand meaningful names than a meaningless number.</p><p>A reverse lookup is accomplished by querying DNS servers for a pointer record (<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ptr-record/\">PTR</a>). PTR records store IP addresses with their segments reversed, and by appending &quot;.in-addr.arpa&quot; to the end. For example, the IP address 192.0.2.1 will have the PTR record stored as 1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. In IPv6, PTR records are stored within the &quot;.ip6.arpa&quot; domain instead of &quot;.in-addr.arpa.&quot;.

In other words, there is no way for the public DNS to provide a useful answer to a question that has no global meaning. It is therefore a good practice for network administrators to ensure that queries for private use addresses are answered locally. However, it is not uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in the public DNS instead of being answered within the network. That creates unnecessary load.</p><p>By definition of being private use, they have no ownership in the public sphere, so there are no authoritative DNS servers to answer the queries. At the very beginning, root servers respond to all these types of queries since they serve the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.</p><p>Over time, due to the wide deployment of private use addresses and the continuing growth of the Internet, traffic on the IN-ADDR.ARPA DNS infrastructure grew and the load due to these junk queries started to cause some concern. Therefore, the idea of offloading IN-ADDR.ARPA queries related to private use addresses was proposed. Following that, the use of anycast for distributing authoritative DNS service for that idea was subsequently proposed at a private meeting of root server operators. And eventually the AS112 service was launched to provide an alternative target for the junk.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-as112-project-is-born\">The AS112 project is born</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-as112-project-is-born\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>To deal with this problem, the Internet community set up special DNS servers called “blackhole servers” as the authoritative name servers that respond to the reverse lookup of the private use address blocks 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 and the link-local address block 169.254.0.0/16 (which also has only local significance). Since the relevant zones are directly delegated to the blackhole servers, this approach has come to be known as Direct Delegation.</p><p>The first two blackhole servers set up by the project are: blackhole-1.iana.org and blackhole-2.iana.org.</p><p>Any server, including DNS name server, needs an IP address to be reachable. The IP address must also be associated with an Autonomous System Number (ASN) so that networks can recognize other networks and route data packets to the IP address destination. To solve this problem, a new authoritative DNS service would be created but, to make it work, the community would have to designate IP addresses for the servers and, to facilitate their availability, an AS number that network operators could use to reach (or provide) the new service.</p><p>The selected AS number (provided by American Registry for Internet Numbers) and namesake of the project, was 112. It was started by a small subset of root server operators, later grown to a group of volunteer name server operators that include many other organizations. They run anycasted instances of the blackhole servers that, together, form a distributed sink for the reverse DNS lookups for private network and link-local addresses sent to the public Internet.</p><p>A reverse DNS lookup for a private use address would see responses like in the example below, where the name server blackhole-1.iana.org is authoritative for it and says the name does not exist, represented in DNS responses by <b>NXDOMAIN</b>.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ dig @blackhole-1.iana.org -x 192.168.1.1 +nord\n\n;; Got answer:\n;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 23870\n;; flags: qr aa; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1\n\n;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:\n; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4096\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;1.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa.\tIN\tPTR\n\n;; AUTHORITY SECTION:\n168.192.in-addr.arpa.\t10800\tIN\tSOA\t168.192.in-addr.arpa. nobody.localhost. 42 86400 43200 604800 10800</pre></code>\n            <p>At the beginning of the project, node operators set up the service in the direct delegation fashion (<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7534\">RFC 7534</a>). However, adding delegations to this service requires all AS112 servers to be updated, which is difficult to ensure in a system that is only loosely-coordinated. An alternative approach using DNAME redirection was subsequently introduced by <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7535\">RFC 7535</a> to allow new zones to be added to the system without reconfiguring the blackhole servers.</p><h4><b>Direct delegation</b></h4><p>DNS zones are directly delegated to the blackhole servers in this approach.</p><p><a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7534\">RFC 7534</a> defines the static set of reverse lookup zones for which AS112 name servers should answer authoritatively.

Introduced by <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6672\">RFC 6672</a>, a DNAME record or Delegation Name Record creates an alias for an entire subtree of the domain name tree. In contrast, the CNAME record creates an alias for a single name and not its subdomains. For a received DNS query, the DNAME record instructs the name server to substitute all those appearing in the left hand (owner name) with the right hand (alias name). The substituted query name, like the CNAME, may live within the zone or may live outside the zone.</p><p>Like the CNAME record, the DNS lookup will continue by retrying the lookup with the substituted name.

Today, it powers 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.1 for Families, Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH), Cloudflare WARP and Cloudflare Gateway.</p><p>The core part of the platform is a non-traditional DNS server, which has a built-in DNS recursive resolver and a forwarder to forward queries to other servers. It consists of four key modules:</p><ol><li><p>A highly efficient listener module that accepts connections for incoming requests.</p></li><li><p>A query router module that decides how a query should be resolved.</p></li><li><p>A conductor module that figures out the best way of exchanging DNS messages with upstream servers.</p></li><li><p>A sandbox environment to host guest applications.</p></li></ol><p>The DNS server itself doesn’t include any business logic, instead the guest applications run in the sandbox environment can implement concrete business logic such as request filtering, query processing, logging, attack mitigation, cache purging, etc.</p><p>The server is written in Rust and the sandbox environment is built on top of a WebAssembly runtime. The combination of Rust and WebAssembly allow us to implement high efficient connection handling, request filtering and query dispatching modules, while having the flexibility of implementing custom business logic in a safe and efficient manner.</p><p>The host exposes a set of APIs, called hostcalls, for the guest applications to accomplish a variety of tasks. You can think of them like syscalls on Linux. Here are few examples functions provided by the hostcalls:</p><ul><li><p>Obtain the current UNIX timestamp</p></li><li><p>Lookup geolocation data of IP addresses</p></li><li><p>Spawn async tasks</p></li><li><p>Create local sockets</p></li><li><p>Forward DNS queries to designated servers</p></li><li><p>Register callback functions of the sandbox hooks</p></li><li><p>Read current request information, and write responses</p></li><li><p>Emit application logs, metric data points and tracing spans/events</p></li></ul><p>The DNS request lifecycle is broken down into phases. A request phase is a point in processing at which sandboxed apps can be called to change the course of request resolution. And each guest application can register callbacks for each phase.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4qQfSG8CCIgFK2qLoO53yw/76dc10939b88d5efb9c4a7cb2e273ee9/image3-20.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"378\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"as112-guest-application\">AS112 guest application</h3>\n            <a href=\"#as112-guest-application\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The AS112 service is built as a guest application written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly.

This app loads all dynamic rules, parses the DSL texts and registers callback functions at phases declared by each rule. And when an incoming query matches the expressions, it executes the designated actions.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"public-reports\">Public reports</h2>\n            <a href=\"#public-reports\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>We collect the following metrics to generate the public statistics that an AS112 operator is expected to share to the operator community:</p><ul><li><p>Number of queries by query type</p></li><li><p>Number of queries by response code</p></li><li><p>Number of queries by protocol</p></li><li><p>Number of queries by IP versions</p></li><li><p>Number of queries with EDNS support</p></li><li><p>Number of queries with DNSSEC support</p></li><li><p>Number of queries by ASN/Data center</p></li></ul><p>We’ll serve the public statistics page on the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> website.
