For years, this played out in the form of &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-shadow-it/\"><u>Shadow IT</u></a>&quot; — employees using unsanctioned laptops or cloud services to get their jobs done faster. Security teams became masters at hunting these rogue systems, setting up firewalls and policies to bring order to the chaos.</p><p>But the new frontier is different, and arguably far more subtle and dangerous.</p><p>Imagine a team of engineers, deep into the development of a groundbreaking new product. They&#39;re on a tight deadline, and a junior engineer, trying to optimize his workflow, pastes a snippet of a proprietary algorithm into a popular public AI chatbot, asking it to refactor the code for better performance. The tool quickly returns the revised code, and the engineer, pleased with the result, checks it in. What they don&#39;t realize is that their query, and the snippet of code, is now part of the AI service’s training data, or perhaps logged and stored by the provider. Without anyone noticing, a critical piece of the company&#39;s intellectual property has just been sent outside the organization&#39;s control, a silent and unmonitored data leak.</p><p>This isn&#39;t a hypothetical scenario. It&#39;s the new reality. Employees, empowered by these incredibly powerful AI tools, are now using them for everything from summarizing confidential documents to generating marketing copy and, yes, even writing code. The data leaving the company in these interactions is often invisible to traditional security tools, which were never built to understand the nuances of a browser tab interacting with a large language model. This quiet, unmanaged usage is &quot;Shadow AI,&quot; and it represents a new, high-stakes security blind spot.</p><p>To combat this, we need a new approach—one that provides visibility into this new class of applications and gives <a href=\" https://blog.cloudflare.com/best-practices-sase-for-ai/\">security teams the control they need</a>, without impeding the innovation that makes these tools so valuable.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"shadow-ai-reporting\"><b>Shadow AI reporting</b></h3>\n      <a href=\"#shadow-ai-reporting\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>This is where the Cloudflare Shadow IT Report comes in. It’s not a list of threats to be blocked, but rather a visibility and analytics tool designed to help you understand the problem before it becomes a crisis. Instead of relying on guesswork or trying to manually hunt down every unsanctioned application, Cloudflare One customers can use the insights from their traffic to gain a clear, data-driven picture of their organization&#39;s application usage.</p><p>The report provides a detailed, categorized view of your application activity, and is easily narrowed down to AI activity. We’ve leveraged our network and threat intelligence capabilities to identify and classify AI services, identifying general-purpose models like ChatGPT, code-generation assistants like GitHub Copilot, and specialized tools used for marketing, data analysis, or other content creation, like Leonardo.ai. This granular view allows security teams to see not just <i>that</i> an employee is using an AI app, but <i>which</i> AI app, and what users are accessing it.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-we-built-it\"><b>How we built it</b></h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-we-built-it\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sharp eyed users may have noticed that we’ve had a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-shadow-it/\"><u>shadow IT</u></a> feature for a while — so what changed? While Cloudflare Gateway, our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/\"><u>secure web gateway (SWG)</u></a>, has recorded some of this data for some time, users have wanted deeper insights and reporting into their organization&#39;s application usage. Cloudflare Gateway processes hundreds of millions of rows of app usage data for our biggest users daily, and that scale was causing issues with queries into larger time windows. Additionally, the original implementation lacked the filtering and customization capabilities to properly investigate the usage of AI applications. We knew this was information that our customers loved, but we weren’t doing a good enough job of showing it to them.</p><p>Solving this was a cross-team effort requiring a complete overhaul by our analytics and reporting engineers. You may have seen our work recently in <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/timescaledb-art/\"><u>this July 2025 blog post </u></a>detailing how we adopted TimescaleDB to support our analytics platform, unlocking our analytics, allowing us to aggregate and compress long term data to drastically improve query performance. This solves the issue we originally faced around our scale, letting our biggest customers query their data for long time periods. Our crawler collects the original HTTP traffic data from Gateway, which we store into a Timescale database.</p><p>Once the data are in our database, we built specific, materialized views in our database around the Shadow IT and AI use case to support analytics for this feature. Whereas the existing HTTP analytics we built are centered around the HTTP requests on an account, these specific views are centered around the information relevant to applications, for example: Which of my users are going to unapproved applications? How much bandwidth are they consuming? Is there an end-user in an unexpected geographical location interacting with an unreviewed application? What devices are using the most bandwidth?</p><p>Over the past year, the team has defined a set framework for the analytics we surface. Our timeseries graphs and top-n graphs are all filterable by duration and the relevant data points shown, allowing users to drill down to specific data points and see the details of their corporate traffic. We overhauled Shadow IT by examining the data we had and researching how AI applications were presenting visibility challenges for customers. From there we leveraged our existing framework and built the Shadow IT dashboard. This delivered the application-level visibility that we know our customers needed.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-to-use-it\"><b>How to use it</b></h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-to-use-it\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"1-proxy-your-traffic-with-gateway\"><b>1.

This helps identify attempts to upload sensitive data to AI applications and pinpoint exactly what data was being transmitted.</p></li><li><p><b>Identify Anomalous AI Usage:</b> The Shadow AI Report might show a spike in usage for a particular AI application. In Log Explorer, you can filter by application status (In Review or Unapproved) for a specific time range. Then, look for unusual patterns, such as a high number of requests from a single source IP address, or unexpected geographic origins, which could indicate compromised accounts or policy evasion attempts.</p></li></ul><p>If AI visibility is a challenge for your organization, the Shadow AI Report is available now for Cloudflare One customers, as part of our broader shadow IT discovery capabilities.

For years, this played out in the form of \"Shadow IT\" — employees using unsanctioned laptops or cloud services to get their jobs done faster. Security teams became masters at hunting these rogue systems, setting up firewalls and policies to bring order to the chaos.\n\nBut the new frontier is different, and arguably far more subtle and dangerous.\n",
