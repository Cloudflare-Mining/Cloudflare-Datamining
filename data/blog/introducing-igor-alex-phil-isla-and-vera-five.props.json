		"html": "<p>When we first started working on Cloudflare we knew a few things:</p><p>​1. There was a huge and unmet need among small and mid-sized websites for better security and performance tools;2. We had great data from <a href=\"http://www.projecthoneypot.org/\">Project Honey Pot</a> and other partners that could help us meet that need; but3. Virtually all the traditional solutions designed for enterprises wouldn&#39;t work for the websites who most needed help.</p><p>If you&#39;re a big enterprise and you want performance and security you buy an expensive piece of hardware and contract with a [content delivery network](<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/\">https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/</a>) or highly connected data center. For the vast majority of websites online, this simply isn&#39;t an option. Not only is the cost prohibitive but most people with websites don&#39;t have access to their physical servers to install hardware. We knew we had to come up with a better, more modern way to deploy Cloudflare.</p><p>One of Lee&#39;s great ideas when he and I started Project Honey Pot nearly seven years ago was to ask people to donate a portion of their DNS records to let us build spam traps. We also used the DNS system to deploy the Project&#39;s http:BL service. I&#39;m friends with David from <a href=\"http://www.opendns.com/\">OpenDNS</a> and liked how they were able to deploy an amazing security product on the web-surfer end of DNS. So, knowing all that about DNS, we set out to build a system that used DNS to supercharge websites.</p><p>For Cloudflare to work we needed to build a globally distributed network of DNS servers. When you sign up for Cloudflare we give you two name servers to list with your <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name-registrar/\">registrar</a> for your domain. In reality, these two name servers actually point to a whole cluster of many servers distributed in multiple data centers and load balanced (using anycast and other network voodoo) throughout the network.</p><p>While most DNS providers give their nameservers boring names like &quot;<a href=\"http://ns1.someboringservice.net\">ns1.someboringservice.net</a>&quot;, we wanted ours to have a personality that represented just how amazing they are. We spent a lot of time trying to think of what embodied the spirit of what these nameservers do for our users until we stumbled upon it: ninjas! They&#39;re fast. They&#39;re good at defending themselves. And they&#39;re stealthy. Just like Cloudflare.</p><p>Today, when you sign up for Cloudflare, you are issued two Ninja Nameservers™ (one male, one female). We have a lot so, every website you sign up, you&#39;re likely to get a unique combination. Once deployed at your registrar, your assigned ninjas stand watch over your website keeping it safe and ensuring it performs as fast as possible. We had a really talented artist (Alaric Holloway) draw all the ninjas. Links to their full profiles will be online soon. In the meantime, I wanted to introduce: Igor, Alex, Phil, Isla, and Vera.</p><p>A full album of all our ninjas can be found on our <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Cloudflare\">Facebook page</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"undefined\" alt=\"undefined\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"undefined\" height=\"undefined\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>",
