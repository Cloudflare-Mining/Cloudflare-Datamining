Our latest generation is now the G9 server. From a G4 server comprising 12 Intel Sandybridge CPU cores, our G9 server has 192 Intel Skylake CPU cores ready to handle today’s load across Cloudflare’s network.

Maximizing compute density is the primary goal since rental colocation space and power are costly. This 2U4N chassis form factor has served us well for the past 3 generations, we’re revisiting this option once more.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/IL5Zupe1s0pPvlWHoaB6E/7ac79582b11ccd3f13743c1e997df544/MSUVbbiNbqCozo5hb0cnaWlQeUUxq3JdbJoZvUrGnY0ly9unm8JfFMKeTcKHp0P49HmMHdJ8f1Fvw7lHu8R1FmEQKKpbUjtP4qdkWMviOf0-NKmksk_Uy_7rFEh.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Exploded picture of the G9 server’s main components. 4 sleds represent 4 nodes, each with 2 24-core Intel CPUs</i></p><p>Each high-level hardware component has gone through their own upgrade as well for a balanced scale up keeping our stack CPU bound, making this generation the most radical revision since we moved on from using HP 5 years ago.

We went with Mellanox for their solid reliability and their readily available 2x25G CX4 model.

Switch and NIC vendors offer models that can be configured as either 10G or 25G.</p><p>Another change is the adapter’s form factor itself being an OCP mezzanine instead of the more conventional Low Profile sized card. QCT is a server system integrator participating in the <a href=\"https://www.opencompute.org/\">Open Compute Project</a>, a non-profit organization establishing an open source hardware ecosystem founded by Facebook, Intel, and Rackspace. Their T42S-2U motherboards each include 2 PCIe x16 Gen3 expansion slots: 1 fit for a regular I/O card and 1 for an OCP mezzanine. The form factor change allows us to occupy the OCP slot leaving the regular slot free to integrate something else that may not be offered with an OCP form factor like a high capacity NVMe SSD or a GPU.

They&#39;re doing over 2x the requests compared to G8 with about 10% less CPU usage. Note that all results here are based from non-optimized systems, so we could add more load on the G9 and have their CPU usage comparable to the G8. Additionally, they&#39;re doing that amount with better CPU processing time shown as nginx execution time. You can see the latency gap between generations widening as we go towards the 99.9th percentile:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6fAxaonFhRQRydhYQXErzS/98c08a99f41bd9fe23656ad50f1a6959/Screen-Shot-2018-10-03-at-6.53.13-PM-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"435\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Long-tail latencies for NGINX CPU processing time (lower is better)</i></p><p>Talking about latency, let’s check how our new SSDs are doing on that front:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6GzzQt3teUZbjXAuJvW9Cj/e3c1ce8ae0a977a04bb6028a887db625/Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-4.59.41-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"886\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Cache disk IOPS and latency (lower is better)</i></p><p>The trend still holds that G9 is doing better. It’s a good thing that the G9’s SSDs aren’t seeing as many IOPS since it means we’re not hitting cache disks as often and are able to store and process more on CPU and memory. We’ve cut the read cache hits and latency by half. Less writes results in better performance consistency and longevity.</p><p>Another metric that G9 does more is power consumption, doing about 55% more than the G8. While it’s not a piece of information to brag about, it is expected when older CPUs were once rated at 85W TDP to now using ones with 150W TDP; and when considering how much work the G9 servers do:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2Kzoz5pwmyzAPfHZRPPcGu/2e82efbde8e2ea31ee8a45b100f26e51/Screen-Shot-2018-10-03-at-7.12.17-PM-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"486\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>G9 is actually 1.5x more power efficient than G8. Temperature readings were checked as well. Inlet and outlet chassis temps, as well as CPU temps, are well within operating temperatures.</p><p>Now that’s muscle! In other words for every 3 G8 servers, just 2 of those G9&#39;s would take on the same workload. If one of our racks normally would have 9 G8 servers, we can switch those out with only 6 G9&#39;s. Inversely planning to turn up a cage of 10 G9 racks would be the same as if we did 15 G8 racks!</p><p>We have <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2018/06/14/cloudflare-to-expand-to-200-cities-by-2019.html\">big plans</a> to cover our entire network with G9 servers, with most of them planned for the existing cities your site most likely uses. By 2019, you’ll benefit with increased bandwidth and lower wait times. And we’ll benefit in expanding and turning up datacenters quicker and more efficiently.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"whats-next\">What's next?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Gen X? Right now is exciting times at Cloudflare. Many teams and engineers are testing, porting, and implementing new stuff that can help us lower operating costs, explore new products and possibilities, and improve Quality of Service. We’re tackling problems and taking on projects that are unique in the industry.</p><p>Serverless computing like <a href=\"/introducing-cloudflare-workers/\">Cloudflare Workers</a> and beyond will ask for new challenges to our infrastructure as all of our customers can program their features on Cloudflare’s edge network.</p><p>The network architecture that was conventionally made up of routers, switches, and servers has been merged into 3-in-1 box solutions allowing Cloudflare services to be set up into locations that weren’t possible before.</p><p>The advent of NVMe and persistent memory, as well as the possibility of turning SSDs into DRAM, is redefining how we design cache servers and handle <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/\">tiered caching</a>. SSDs and memory aren’t treated as separate entities like they used to.</p><p>Hardware brings the company together like a rug in a living room. See how many links I mentioned above to show you how we’re one team dedicated to build a better Internet. Everything that we do here roots down to how we manage the tons of aluminum and silicon we’ve invested. There&#39;s a lot here to develop our hardware to help Cloudflare grow to where we envision ourselves to be. If you’d like to contribute, we’d love to hear from you.</p>",
