		"html": "<p>One of the services that CloudFlare provides to paying customers is called <a href=\"/introducing-polish-automatic-image-optimizati\">Polish</a>. Polish automatically recompresses images cached by CloudFlare to ensure that they are as small as possible and can be delivered to web browsers as quickly as possible.</p><p>We&#39;ve recently rolled out a new version of Polish that uses updated techniques (and was completely rewritten from a collection of programs into a single executable written in Go). As part of that rewrite we looked at the performance of the recently released <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2014/07/15/mozilla-advances-jpeg-encoding-with-mozjpeg-2-0/\">mozjpeg 2.0 project</a> for JPEG compression.</p><p>To get a sense of its performance (both in terms of compression and in terms of CPU usage) when compared to <a href=\"http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org/\">libjpeg-turbo</a> I randomly selected 10,000 JPEG images (totaling 2,564,135,285 bytes for an average image size of about 256KB) cached by CloudFlare and recompressed them using the jpegtran program provided by libjpeg-turbo 1.3.1 and mozjpeg 2.0. The exact command used in both cases was:</p><p>jpegtran -outfile out.jpg -optimise -copy none in.jpg</p><p>Of the 10,000 images in cache, mozjpeg 2.0 failed to make 691 of them any smaller compared with 3,471 for libjpeg-turbo. So mozjpeg 2.0 was significantly better at recompressing images.</p><p>On average images were compressed by 3.0% using mozjpeg 2.0 (ignoring images that weren&#39;t compressed at all) and by 2.5% using libjpeg-turbo (again ignoring images that weren&#39;t compressed at all). This seems similar to Mozilla&#39;s reported 5% improvement compared to libjpeg-turbo.</p><p>So, mozjpeg 2.0 achieved better compression on this set of files and compressed many more of them (93.1% vs. 65.3%).</p><p>As example, here&#39;s an image, not from the sample set. Its original size was 1,984,669 bytes. When compressed with libjpeg-turbo it is 1,956,200 bytes (2.4% removed); when compressed with mozjpeg 2.0 it is 1,874,491 (5.6% removed). (The mozjpeg 2.0 version is 4.2% smaller than the libjpeg-turbo version).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3jPHn2DLb6zGPcmjvyvK9K/681edacabe75330cf88c92881195c389/photo_3.jpg\" alt=\"Pic du Midi\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2448\" height=\"3264\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The distribution of compression ratios seen using mozjpeg 2.0 is shown below.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1X8WfaJ2oVW143Cgp4v8oI/c029620bf7434141c60044bfd6a9042b/compression.png\" alt=\"Compression seen\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1228\" height=\"839\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This improved compression comes at a price. The run time for the complete compression (including where compression failed to create an improvement) was 273 seconds for libjpeg-turbo and 474 seconds for mozjpeg 2.0. So mozjpeg 2.0 took about 1.7x longer, but, of course, achieved better compression on more of the files.</p><p>Because we&#39;d like to get the highest compression possible we&#39;ve assigned an engineer internally to look at optimization of mozjpeg 2.0 (specifically for the Intel processors we use) and will contribute back improvements to the project.</p><p>We&#39;re investing quite heavily in optimization projects (such as improvements to <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2014/07/28/cloudflare-matthew-prince-security-protection-builders\">gzip</a> (code <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/zlib\">here</a>) and <a href=\"http://luajit.org/sponsors.html#sponsorship_perf\">LuaJIT</a>, and things like a very fast <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/lua-aho-corasick\">Aho-Corasick</a> implementation). If you&#39;re interested in low-level optimization for Intel processors, think about <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/join-our-team\">joining us</a>.</p><p>PS After this blog post was published some folks <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8105640\">pointed</a> out that the best comparison would be when the -progessive flag is used. I went back and checked and I had in fact done that in the 10,000 file test and so the data there is correct. However, the command shown above is not. The actual command used was:</p><p>jpegtran -outfile out.jpg -optimise -progressive -copy none in.jpg</p><p>Also, the image shown above was generated using the incorrect command because I did it outside the 10,000 file test. That paragraph above should say:</p><p>As example, here&#39;s an image, not from the sample set. Its original size was\n1,984,669 bytes. When compressed with libjpeg-turbo it is 1,885,090 bytes\n(4% removed); when compressed with mozjpeg 2.0 it is 1,874,491 (5.6% removed).\n(The mozjpeg 2.0 version is 0.6% smaller than the libjpeg-turbo version).</p>",
