Central to that control plane is the Kubernetes API server, which interacts with components like the scheduler and manager.</p><p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/\">kubectl</a> is the Kubernetes command-line tool that developers can use to interact with that API server. Users run <code>kubectl</code> commands to perform actions like starting and stopping the nodes, or modifying other elements of the control plane.</p><p>In most deployments, users connect to a VPN that allows them to run commands against that API server by addressing it over the same local network. In that architecture, user traffic to run these commands must be backhauled through a physical or virtual VPN appliance. More concerning, in most cases the user connecting to the API server will also be able to connect to other addresses and ports in the private network where the cluster runs.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-does-cloudflare-access-apply\">How does Cloudflare Access apply?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-does-cloudflare-access-apply\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Cloudflare Access can secure web applications as well as non-HTTP connections like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/\">SSH</a>, RDP, and the commands sent over <code>kubectl</code>.

Once downloaded, they will need to run a corresponding command to create a local SOCKS proxy.

In this model, TLS verification can still be exchanged with the <code>kubectl</code> API server without disabling or modifying that flow for end users.</p><p>Users can then create an alias to save time when connecting.

At Cloudflare, we have a team that manages our own Kubernetes deployments and we went to them to discuss the prototype. However, they had more than just some casual feedback and notes for us.</p><p>They told us to stop.</p><p>We had started down an implementation path that was technically sound and solved the use case, but did so in a way that engineers who spend all day working with pods and containers would find to be a real irritant. The flow required a small change in presenting certificates, which did not feel cumbersome when we tested it, but we do not use it all day. That grain of sand would cause real blisters as a new requirement in the workflow.</p><p>With their input, we stopped the release, and changed that step significantly. We worked through ideas, iterated with them, and made sure the Kubernetes team at Cloudflare felt this was not just good enough, but better.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Support for <code>kubectl</code> is available in the latest release of the <code>cloudflared</code> tool.
