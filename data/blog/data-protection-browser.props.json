The dominance of web-based applications in the workplace has created a challenge for security teams who race to stay patch zero-day vulnerabilities and protect sensitive data stored in self-hosted and SaaS based applications.</p><p>In an attempt to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/\">protect users and applications from web based attacks</a>, administrators have historically relied on DNS or HTTP inspection to prevent threats from reaching the browser. These tools, while useful for protecting against <i>known threats,</i> are difficult to tune without false-positives (negatively impacting user productivity and increasing IT support burden) and ineffective against zero day vulnerabilities.</p><p>Browser isolation technologies mitigate risk by shifting the risk of executing foreign code from the endpoint to a secure environment. Historically administrators have had to make a compromise between <b>performance</b> and <b>security</b> when adopting such a solution. They could either:</p><ul><li><p><b>Prioritize</b> <b>security</b> by choosing a solution that relies on pixel pushing techniques to serve a visual representation to users. This comes at the cost of performance by introducing latency, graphical artifacts and heavy bandwidth usage.</p></li></ul><p><b><i>OR</i></b></p><ul><li><p><b>Prioritize performance</b> by choosing a solution that relies on code scrubbing techniques to unpack, inspect and repack the webpage. This model is fragile (often failing to repack leading to a broken webpage) and insecure by allowing undetected threats to compromise users.</p></li></ul><p>At Cloudflare, we know that security products do not need to come at the expense of performance. We developed a third option that delivers a remote browsing experience without needing to compromise on performance and security for users.</p><ul><li><p><b>Prioritize security</b> by never sending foreign code to the endpoint and executing it in a secure remote environment.</p></li><li><p><b>Prioritize</b> <b>performance</b> sending light-weight vector instructions (rather than pixels) over the wire and minimize remote latency on our global edge network.</p></li></ul>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/41ebdDVZfNPcZDrzSErdei/64d92c0dfee8d66ac8ec820710c5aab4/image4-14.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"606\" height=\"358\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This unique approach delivers an isolated browser without the security or performance challenges faced by legacy solutions.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"data-control-through-the-browser\">Data control through the browser</h3>\n      <a href=\"#data-control-through-the-browser\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Malware and zero-day threats are not the only security challenges administrators face with web browsers. The mass adoption of SaaS products has made the web browser the primary tool used to access data. Lack of control over both the application and the browser has left administrators little control over their data once it is delivered to an endpoint.</p><p>Data loss prevention tools typically rely on pattern recognition to partially or completely redact the transmission of sensitive data values. This model is useful for protecting against an unexpected breach of PII and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-pci-dss-compliance/\">PCI</a> data, such as locations and financial information but comes at the loss of visibility.</p><p>The redaction model falls short when sensitive data does not fit into easily recognizable patterns, and the end-users require visibility to do their job. In industries such as health care, redacting sensitive data is not feasible as medical professions require visibility of patient notes and appointment data.</p><p>Once data lands in the web browser it is trivial for a user to copy-paste and print sensitive data into another website, application, or physical location. These seemingly innocent actions can lead to data being misplaced by naive users leading to a data breach. Administrators have had limited options to protect data in the browser, some even going so far as to deploy virtual desktop services to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-access-control/\">control access</a> to a SaaS based customer relationship management (CRM) tool. This increased operating costs, and frustrated users who had to learn how to use computer-in-a-computer just to use a website.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"one-click-to-isolate-data-in-the-browser\">One-click to isolate data in the browser</h3>\n      <a href=\"#one-click-to-isolate-data-in-the-browser\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare Browser Isolation executes all website code (including HTML) in the remote browser.
