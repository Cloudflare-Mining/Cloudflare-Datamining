Unlike amplification attacks, this is a direct flood aimed at degrading performance or causing outages, often over UDP port 53, but sometimes over TCP as well (especially for DNS-over-TCP or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/\"><u>DNSSEC</u></a>-enabled zones).</p></li><li><p><b>How to defend against the attack:</b> Use <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/dns/\"><u>Cloudflare DNS</u></a> as primary or secondary, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/dns/dns-firewall/\"><u>Cloudflare DNS Firewall</u></a> and/or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/\"><u>Cloudflare Magic Transit</u></a> to absorb and mitigate query floods before they reach your origin. Cloudflare’s global network handles tens of millions of DNS queries per second with built-in DDoS filtering and query caching, blocking malformed or excessive traffic while answering legitimate requests.</p></li><li><p><b>How to avoid unintended impact:</b> Avoid blocking all DNS traffic or disabling UDP port 53, which would break normal resolution. Rely on Cloudflare’s DNS-specific protection such as the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/overview/advanced-dns-protection/\"><u>Advanced DNS Protection system</u></a>, and deploy DNSSEC-aware protection to handle TCP-based query floods safely.</p></li></ul><h4><b>SYN Flood Attack</b></h4><ul><li><p><b>Type:</b> Flood</p></li><li><p><b>How it works:</b> In a SYN flood, threat actors  send a large volume of TCP SYN packets—often with spoofed IP addresses—to initiate connections that are never completed. This leaves the target system with half-open connections, consuming memory and connection tracking resources, potentially exhausting server limits and preventing real clients from connecting.</p></li><li><p><b>How to defend against the attack:</b> Use <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/\"><u>Cloudflare Magic Transit</u></a> to intercept and mitigate TCP SYN floods at the edge. Cloudflare leverages SYN cookies, connection tracking, and behavioral analysis to distinguish real clients from spoofed or malicious sources, ensuring legitimate TCP connections are completed successfully. Using Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/cdn/\"><u>CDN</u></a>/<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/waf/\"><u>WAF</u></a> services or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cloudflare-spectrum/\"><u>Cloudflare Spectrum</u></a> which are both reverse-proxy services for HTTP or TCP, respectively. Using a reverse-proxy basically eliminates the possible impact of TCP-based DDoS attacks.</p></li><li><p><b>How to avoid unintended impact:</b> Blocking all SYN traffic or applying aggressive timeouts can block real users. Instead, rely on <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/overview/advanced-tcp-protection/\"><u>Cloudflare’s Advanced TCP protection system</u></a>, which uses SYN rate shaping, anomaly detection, and spoofed-packet filtering to mitigate attacks without affecting genuine client connections.</p></li></ul><h4><b>UDP DDoS attack</b></h4><ul><li><p><b>Type</b>: Flood</p></li><li><p><b>How it works</b>: A high volume of UDP packets is sent to random or specific ports on the target IP address(es). It may attempt to saturate the Internet link or overwhelm its in-line appliances with more packets than it can handle in order to create disruption or an outage.</p></li><li><p><b>How to defend against the attack</b>: Deploy cloud-based volumetric DDoS protection that can fingerprint attack traffic in real-time such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/\"><u>Cloudflare Magic Transit</u></a> or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cloudflare-spectrum/\"><u>Cloudflare Spectrum</u></a>, apply smart rate-limiting on UDP traffic, and drop unwanted UDP traffic altogether with the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/network-services/products/magic-firewall/\"><u>Magic Firewall</u></a>.</p></li><li><p><b>How to avoid unintended impact</b>: Aggressive filtering may disrupt legitimate UDP services such as VoIP, video conferencing, or online games.

Threat actors often rely on brief bursts of concentrated traffic—sometimes lasting as little as 45 seconds as seen with the monumental 7.3 Tbps DDoS attack — in an attempt to avoid detection, overwhelm targets and cause maximum disruption before defenses can fully activate. This tactic of short, high-intensity bursts makes detection and mitigation more challenging and underscores the need for always-on, real-time protection. Thankfully, Cloudflare’s autonomous DDoS defenses kick in immediately.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"helping-build-a-better-internet\">Helping build a better Internet</h2>\n            <a href=\"#helping-build-a-better-internet\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>At Cloudflare, we’re committed to helping build a better Internet.
