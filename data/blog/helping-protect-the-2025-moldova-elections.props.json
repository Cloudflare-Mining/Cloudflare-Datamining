The election was conducted amid claims of Russian interference, both <a href=\"https://www.osce.org/odihr/598219\"><u>online and offline</u></a>. Ensuring the security of the election infrastructure was a critical priority, not just to protect the vote count, but to guarantee the system&#39;s resilience so that all Moldovans could access authoritative information about the election.</p><p>We were proud to support the Moldovan Central Election Commission (CEC) ahead of their September 28th election. Consistent with public <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/28/world/europe/moldova-election-russia.html\"><u>reporting</u></a>, cyberattacks were not the story; the focus remained on the democratic process.

Since 2017, through the Athenian Project, we have provided protection to over 450 state and local government election entities in the United States. We were able to provide this expertise to the CEC and in less than a week we onboarded many of their election websites and quickly deployed mitigation strategies to help prepare them for election day. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"cyber-attacks-to-the-moldova-election-commission\">Cyber attacks to the Moldova Election Commission </h3>\n      <a href=\"#cyber-attacks-to-the-moldova-election-commission\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare data shows that the Moldovan Election Commission experienced significant cyber attacks during the recent elections. From September 27 to September 29, 2025, our data shows how Moldovan citizens used the Internet to follow the political process and highlights the efforts by malicious actors to disrupt key election services.</p><p>For example, on September 28, 2025, the Moldovan Central Election Commission (CEC) experienced a series of concentrated, high-volume (DDoS) attacks strategically timed throughout the day. The attack began in the morning at 09:06:00 UTC and lasted for over twelve hours and ended as the official result reporting was underway at 21:34:00 UTC. In total, we mitigated over 898 million malicious requests directed at the CEC over the twelve-hour period.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/36PlFQIaFV2p47TTTn4tQF/690a36f7587cd9510d0ee63ad3272fb0/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"802\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Cloudflare systems categorized this activity into 11 attack &quot;chunks&quot; — which is a term used to denote a multi-wave pattern indicating a sophisticated attack.

Multiple sustained waves, including attacks that peaked at over 243,000 rps, were mitigated. Fortunately, Cloudflare&#39;s automated defenses successfully stopped the attacks in real-time, ensuring the CEC website remained online and accessible for Moldovan citizens.</p><p>The Moldovan government confirmed the attacks, as the Information Technology and Cybersecurity Service (STISC) reported a wide-ranging campaign targeting the CEC.md platform, government cloud systems, and diaspora voting stations. STISC also <a href=\"https://stisc.gov.md/ro/comunicate-de-presa/comunicat-de-presa-2?cf_history_state=%7B%22guid%22%3A%22C255D9FF78CD46CDA4F76812EA68C350%22%2C%22historyId%22%3A28%2C%22targetId%22%3A%221F5710F55D31707C65DF63B5FE3A3B5A%22%7D\"><u>confirmed</u></a> that the attacks were successfully neutralized, without any impact on the availability or integrity of electoral services.</p><blockquote><p><i>“On behalf of the Information Technology and Cybersecurity Service (STISC), the institution technically responsible for ensuring cybersecurity of the electoral process conducted by the Central Electoral Commission of the Republic of Moldova on 28 September, we would like to extend our sincere gratitude for your outstanding support.
