Our customers have accelerated their ZTNA implementations for web-based applications in particular, using our intuitive workflows for Access applications tied to public hostnames.</p><p>However, given our architecture design, we have primarily handled private network application access (applications tied to private IP addresses or hostnames) through the network firewall component of our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/\"><u>Secure Web Gateway (SWG)</u></a> service, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/\"><u>Cloudflare Gateway</u></a>. We provided a small wrapper from Access to connect the two experiences. While this implementation technically got the job done, there were some clear downsides, and our customers have frequently cited the inconsistency.</p><p>Today, we are thrilled to announce that we have redesigned the self-hosted private application administrative experience within Access to match the experience for web-based apps on public hostnames. We are introducing support for private hostname and IP address-defined applications directly within Access, as well as reusable access policies. Together, these updates make ZTNA even easier for our customers to deploy and streamline ongoing policy management.</p><p>In order to better understand how this feature improves the overall functionality of Access, let’s explore what makes up a “private” application, how they are typically accessed, what was possible before this feature, and what the new feature enables.

I can host an application on <i>application.mycompany</i>, and it is a valid internal DNS record. </p><p>In this example, I am running my web server on Google Cloud and will call the application <i>kennyapache.local</i>.

A single change to a reusable policy will propagate to all associated applications, significantly simplifying management. With this new capability, we anticipate that many of our customers will be able to move from managing hundreds of access policies to a small handful. We’ve also renamed &quot;Access Groups&quot; to &quot;Rule Groups,&quot; aligning with their actual function and reducing confusion with identity provider (IdP) groups.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"a-redesigned-user-interface\">A redesigned user interface</h3>\n      <a href=\"#a-redesigned-user-interface\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Alongside these functional updates, we’ve launched a significant UI refresh based on years of user feedback.
