According to the <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/50dccfb5-81ec-4d9e-a1d9-3b9c266ab2f2?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"><u>World Bank</u></a> and the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/observances/micro-small-medium-businesses-day\"><u>UN</u></a>, small and medium-sized businesses make up about 90 percent of all businesses, between 50-70 percent of global employment, and 50 percent of global GDP. They not only drive local and national economies, but also sustain the livelihoods of women, youth, and other groups in vulnerable situations. </p><p>As part of MSME Day, we wanted to highlight some of the amazing startups and small businesses that are using Cloudflare to not only secure and improve their websites, but also build, scale, and deploy new serverless applications (and businesses) directly on Cloudflare&#39;s global network. </p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"a-startup-for-startups\">A startup for startups</h2>\n            <a href=\"#a-startup-for-startups\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-winner-of-the-2009-harvard-busines/\"><u>started</u></a> as an idea to provide better security and performance tools for everyone. Back in 2010, if you were a large enterprise and wanted better performance and security for your website, you could buy an expensive piece of on-premise hardware or contract with a large, global <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/\"><u>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</u></a> provider. Those same types of services were not only unaffordable for most website owners or smaller businesses, but also generally unavailable, as they typically demanded expensive on-premise hardware or direct server access that most smaller operations lacked. Cloudflare launched, fittingly <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/reflections-on-techcrunch-disrupt-launch/\"><u>at a startup competition</u></a>, with the goal of making those same types of tools available to everyone.</p><p>As Cloudflare has grown, we have <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-commitment-to-free/\"><u>continued</u></a> to highlight how our millions of free customers, many of them individual developers, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/expanding-cloudflares-startup-program/\"><u>startups</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-helps-protect-small-businesses/\"><u>small businesses</u></a>, drive our network, company, and mission. They help keep our costs low, allow us to interconnect with more networks, and help us build better products.   </p><p>Over the last 12 months, we have put even more of an emphasis on supporting startup and small business communities by expanding free <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/\"><u>developer tools</u></a>, which make it easier for anyone to build full stack, <a href=\"https://ai.cloudflare.com/\"><u>AI-enabled applications</u></a> directly on Cloudflare&#39;s network, and investing in programs like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/forstartups/\"><u>Cloudflare for Startups</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/workers-launchpad/\"><u>Workers Launchpad</u></a>, and the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/en-us/launchpad-cohort4-dev-starter-pack/\"><u>Dev Alliance</u></a>. For example:  </p><ul><li><p>More than 3,000 startups are receiving free credits to build and scale their applications directly on Cloudflare&#39;s global network using our developer services. </p></li><li><p>In 2024 alone, 122 startups in 22 countries were accepted into Cloudflare&#39;s Launchpad Program, which provides additional infrastructure, tools, and community support to help entrepreneurs scale their applications and businesses, including access to Cloudflare <a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/shows/workers-launchpad-demo-day\"><u>demo days</u></a>. </p></li><li><p>Since 2022, Cloudflare has worked with over 40 venture capital partners to secure more than $2 billion in potential financing for companies participating in our startup programs. </p></li></ul><p>With the right tools in hand, entrepreneurs are turning ideas into real world impact, and we’re honored to support them. </p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"spotlighting-innovation-across-the-globe\">Spotlighting innovation across the globe</h2>\n            <a href=\"#spotlighting-innovation-across-the-globe\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare proudly supports over hundreds of thousands of small businesses that are using our services, including SaaS startups, health and wellness providers, real estate firms, local retailers, and global service providers.

security training for new businesses.

The session included a live onboarding session, training on security services, and information on the most common cyber threats. Our first session attracted over 95 participants, and due to the high demand, Cloudflare is planning to host an additional in-person training session later this year.

The guide includes step-by-step instructions that will allow anyone to better understand cyber security services and protect their business and customers from common cyberattacks. For more information, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/small-business/\"><u>Cloudflare for Small Businesses</u></a> page to download the guide today. </p><p>Cloudflare will always make robust security services available to any small business that needs them, free of charge. It is a fundamental part of our mission to help build a better Internet and our identity as a company. </p><p>If you are building a small business and need access to better developer or security services, getting started with Cloudflare is simple, fast, and straightforward. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/\"><u>Signing up for a Free plan</u></a> takes only minutes and can instantly provide access to the tools you need to secure and accelerate your web presence and keep your small business thriving.</p>",
