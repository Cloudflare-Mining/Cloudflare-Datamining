Even then, I secretly worried that an enterprising bad guy would recognize some pattern in the traps and be able to avoid them. We watched carefully for 9 years and no one ever took the time to do so. It was great, on one hand, since it meant that Project Honey Pot kept tracking attackers but, on the other, it meant it was never causing them enough trouble that they&#39;d spend the engineering effort to defeat us. Lee and I learned the lesson: don&#39;t over-engineer too early.</p><p>Which brings me back to IUAM. This morning we got word from the great folks over at <a href=\"http://www.eset.com\">ESET</a> that they&#39;d <a href=\"http://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/02/13/malware-evolving-to-defeat-anti-ddos-services-like-cloudflare/\">detected malware specifically designed to bypass CloudFlare&#39;s IUAM</a>. Called OutFlare -- how cool is it that we have malware named after us!! -- the malware reads our IUAM page, finds the simple math problem, and calculates the answer. It is hardly rocket science, but it was actually pretty thrilling to the whole CloudFlare team that we&#39;d been so successful at stopping attackers that at least one of them took the time to reverse engineer this protection.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"proof-of-work\">Proof of Work</h4>\n      <a href=\"#proof-of-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Unlike me, some other engineers on CloudFlare&#39;s team had a suspicion that this day would come. They therefore had, waiting in the wings, code to increase the complexity of IUAM&#39;s challenges. The malware pulls the math equation off the page and computes the answer before posting back. The solution was easy: obfuscate the equation and run through some other tricks that make it hard to find the answer if you&#39;re not actually rendering the Javascript.</p><p>Today, after getting word that the simple version of IUAM had been reverse engineered by the OutFlare&#39;s malware, we pushed an update. If you&#39;re using IUAM there&#39;s nothing you need to do to take advantage of the new protection, we&#39;ve already updated the protection rendering the OutFlare malware obsolete.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6oycmQjNNld5vVxFdym7qT/1138ecefbbbf7954b9f5d794b7294242/proof_of_work.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"When the Attackers Name Malware After You, You Know You're Doing Something\nRight\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"240\" height=\"210\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Going forward, we have plans if this scheme gets cracked. Specifically, we have an IUAM version that relies on a field of mathematics known as &quot;proof of work&quot; problems. These are difficult to compute answers for but easy to verify. A recent example of such a proof of work problem which has captured the imagination of much of the tech community is Bitcoin. The electronic currency requires a significant amount of computational time to find the answer to a problem, but once found each answer (&quot;coin&quot;) is easy to verify.</p><p>In Bitcoin&#39;s case, the difficulty of the question is adjusted upward over time to compensate for increasing computing power and to control currency inflation. We can use the same premise to increase the &quot;work&quot; that an attacker needs to do when we detect a Layer 7 attack against a CloudFlare customer.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"arms-race-bet-on-the-cloud\">Arms Race?

In this case there may be, but I like our odds in such a war. As today&#39;s example demonstrated, because CloudFlare is deployed as a service and we can update our systems to adjust to new threats in realtime we have an asymmetrical advantage. Pity the poor malware writer who now has to reverse engineer the new IUAM protection and push a code change to all his bots. If he comes up with something effective, we&#39;ll just adapt again — instantly.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2zKZBB94U1ek9GSeVwzipO/b007215000ab6705a574425c03b64ca2/arms_race.gif.scaled500.gif\" alt=\"When the Attackers Name Malware After You, You Know You're Doing Something Right\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"499\" height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The history of such arms races suggests you should bet on the cloud to win. In the spam wars, spammers and anti-spam software makers were locked in an arms race that it looked like neither would win from the mid-90s through the mid-2000s. Then something changed: new services like MXLogic, MessageLabs, CloudMark, and Postini started delivering anti-spam not as software but as a &quot;cloud&quot; service. Not only were these services easier to install and administer than previous anti-spam software or appliances, they could also adjust to spammers in realtime. The result has been that today these services have largely won the spam wars.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"one-more-thing\">One More Thing</h4>\n      <a href=\"#one-more-thing\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>One more thing with regard to OutFlare. While the malware was able to read and pass the simple math challenge, that is only one layer of IUAM&#39;s protection.
