	<p>When August comes, for many, at least in the Northern Hemisphere, it’s time to enjoy summer and/or vacations. Here are some deep dive reading suggestions from our Cloudflare Blog for any time, weather or time of the year. There’s also some reading material on how the Internet works, and a glimpse into our history. </p>
	<p>To create the list (that goes beyond 2022), initially we asked inside the company for favorite blog posts. Many explained how a particular blog post made them want to work at Cloudflare (including some of those who have been at the company for many years). And then, we also heard from readers by asking the question on <a href="https://twitter.com/Cloudflare/status/1555557749307719680" target="_blank">our Twitter</a> account: “What’s your favorite blog post from the Cloudflare Blog and why?” </p>

		<li><strong>Cloudflare’s view of the Rogers Communications outage in Canada (</strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-view-of-the-rogers-communications-outage-in-canada/"><strong>✍️</strong></a><strong> 2022)</strong> <br>One of the largest ISPs in Canada, Rogers Communications, had a huge outage on July 8, 2022, that lasted for more than 17 hours. From our view of the Internet, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-view-of-the-rogers-communications-outage-in-canada/"><strong>we show</strong></a> why we concluded it seemed caused by an internal error and how the Internet, being a network of networks, all bound together by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/" target="_blank">BGP</a>, was related to the disruption.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong><strong><strong>Understanding how Facebook disappeared from the Internet (</strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/"><strong>✍️</strong></a><strong> 2021). </strong></strong></strong><br>“Facebook can't be down, can it?”, we thought, for a second, on October 4, 2021. It was, and we had a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/"><strong>deep dive</strong></a> about it, where BGP was also ‘king’. </li>

	<p><em>Albert Einstein's </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" target="_blank"><em>special theory of relativity</em></a><em> famously dictates that no known object can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum, which is 299,792 km/s. </em></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Welcome to Speed Week and a Waitless Internet</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/fastest-internet/"><strong>✍️</strong></a><strong> 2021). </strong><br>There’s no object, as far as we, humans, know, that is faster than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light" target="_blank">speed of light</a>. In this <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/fastest-internet/"><strong>blog post</strong></a> you’ll get a sense of the physical limits of Internet speeds (“the speed of light is really slow”). How it all works through electrons through wires, lasers blasting data down fiber optic cables, and how building a waitless Internet is hard. <br>We go on to explain the factors that go into building our fast global network: bandwidth, latency, reliability, caching, cryptography, DNS, preloading, cold starts, and more; and how Cloudflare zeroes in on the most powerful number there is: zero. And here’s a challenge, there are a few movies, books, board game references hidden in the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/fastest-internet/">post</a> for you to find.<br><br></li>

I want better.”</em><br>— <strong>Ray Bradbury</strong>, from Beyond 1984: The People Machines</blockquote>

		<li><strong>Securing the post-quantum world (</strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/securing-the-post-quantum-world/"><strong>✍️</strong></a><strong> 2020).</strong><br>This one is more about the future of the Internet. We have many post-quantum <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/post-quantum/">related posts</a>, including the recent standardization one (‘<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise/">NIST’s pleasant post-quantum surprise</a>’), but <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/securing-the-post-quantum-world/"><strong>here</strong></a> you have an easy-to-understand explanation of a complex but crucial for the future of the Internet topic. More on those challenges and opportunities in 2022 <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-future/">here</a>. <br>The sum up is: “Quantum computers are coming that will have the ability to break the cryptographic mechanisms we rely on to secure modern communications, but there is hope”.

		<li><strong>SAD DNS Explained (</strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sad-dns-explained/"><strong>✍️</strong></a><strong> 2020).</strong> <br>A 2020 attack against the Domain Name System (DNS) called SAD DNS (Side channel AttackeD DNS) leveraged features of the networking stack in modern operating systems. It’s a good excuse to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sad-dns-explained/"><strong>explain</strong></a> how the DNS protocol and spoofing <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-encryption-explained/">work</a>, and how the industry can prevent it — another post expands on improving <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/oblivious-dns/">DNS privacy</a> with Oblivious DoH in 1.1.1.1.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>Privacy needs to be built into the Internet (</strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-privacy/"><strong>✍️</strong></a><strong> 2020)</strong><br>A bit of history is always interesting and of value (at least for me). To launch one of our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/privacy/">Privacy</a> Weeks, in 2020, here’s a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-privacy/"><strong>general view</strong></a> to the three different phases of the Internet. Until the 1990s the race was for connectivity. With the introduction of SSL in 1994, the Internet moved to a second phase where security became paramount (it helped create the dotcom rush and the secure, online world we live in today). Now, it’s all about the Phase 3 of the Internet we’re helping to build: always on, always secure, always private.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>50 Years of The Internet. Work in Progress to a Better Internet (</strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/50-years-of-the-internet-work-in-progress-to-a-better-internet/"><strong>✍️</strong></a> <strong>2019)</strong><br>In 2019, we were <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/50-years-of-the-internet-work-in-progress-to-a-better-internet/"><strong>celebrating 50</strong></a> years from when the very first network packet took flight from the Los Angeles campus at UCLA to the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) building in Palo Alto. Those two California sites had kicked-off the world of packet networking, on the ARPANET, and of the modern Internet as we use and know it today. Here we go through some Internet history. <br>This reminds me of this December 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/Cloudflare/status/1471918044343676936" target="_blank">conversation</a> about how the Web began, 30 years earlier. Cloudflare CTO John Graham-Cumming meets Dr. Ben Segal, early Internet pioneer and CERN's first official TCP/IP Coordinator, and Francois Fluckiger, director of the CERN School of Computing. <a href="https://twitter.com/Cloudflare/status/1471918044343676936" target="_blank">Here</a>, we learn how the World Wide Web became an open source project.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>Welcome to Crypto Week (</strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/crypto-week-2018/"><strong>✍️</strong></a> <strong>2018).</strong><br>If you want to know why cryptography is so important for the Internet, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/crypto-week-2018/"><strong>here’s</strong></a> a good place to start. The Internet, with all of its marvels in connecting people and ideas, needs an upgrade, and one of the tools that can make things better is cryptography. There’s also a more mathematical <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-pass-the-math/">privacy pass protocol</a> related perspective (that is the basis of the work to eliminate <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/">CAPTCHAs</a>).<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>Why TLS 1.3 isn't in browsers yet (</strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-tls-1-3-isnt-in-browsers-yet/"><strong>✍️</strong></a><strong> 2017).</strong><br>It’s all <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-tls-1-3-isnt-in-browsers-yet/"><strong>about</strong></a>: “Upgrading a security protocol in an ecosystem as complex as the Internet is difficult. You need to update clients and servers and make sure everything in between continues to work correctly. The Internet is in the middle of such an upgrade right now.” More on that from 2021 <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/handshake-encryption-endgame-an-ech-update/">here</a>: <em>Handshake Encryption: Endgame (an ECH update)</em>.<br><br></li>
		<li><strong>How to build your own public key infrastructure (</strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-build-your-own-public-key-infrastructure/"><strong>✍️</strong></a> <strong>2015).</strong><br>A way of <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-build-your-own-public-key-infrastructure/"><strong>getting to know</strong></a> how a major part of securing a network as geographically diverse as Cloudflare’s is protecting data as it travels between datacenters. “Great security architecture requires a defense system with multiple layers of protection”. From the same year, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-its-harder-to-forge-a-sha-1-certificate-than-it-is-to-find-a-sha-1-collision/">here’s</a> something about digital signatures being the bedrock of trust.<br><br></li>

	<p>Again, if you like Twitter threads, <a href="https://twitter.com/grittygrease/status/1555201358357270528" target="_blank"><strong>this</strong></a> recent Nick Sullivan one starts with an announcement (Cloudflare now allows <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/experiment-with-pq/">experiments with post-quantum cryptography</a>) and goes on explaining what some of the more relevant Internet acronyms mean. Example: TLS, or Transport Layer Security, it’s the ubiquitous encryption and authentication protocol that protects web requests online.</p>

		<li><strong>Cloudflare goes InterPlanetary - Introducing Cloudflare’s IPFS Gateway (</strong><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway/"><strong>✍️</strong></a><strong> 2018).</strong><br>We <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway/"><strong>introduced</strong></a> Cloudflare’s IPFS Gateway, an easy way to access content from the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This served as the platform for many new, at the time, highly-reliable and security-enhanced web applications. It was the first product to be released as part of our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway" target="_blank">Distributed Web Gateway</a> project and is a different perspective from the traditional web. <br>IPFS is a peer-to-peer file system composed of thousands of computers around the world, each of which stores files on behalf of the network. And, yes, it can be used as a method for a possible Mars (Moon, etc.) Internet in the future.
