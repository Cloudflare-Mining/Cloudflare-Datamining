	<p>When August comes, for many, at least in the Northern Hemisphere, it’s time to enjoy summer and/or vacations. Here are some deep dive reading suggestions from our Cloudflare Blog for any time, weather or time of the year. There’s also some reading material on how the Internet works, and a glimpse into our history.</p>
	<p>To create the list (that goes beyond 2022), initially we asked inside the company for favorite blog posts. Many explained how a particular blog post made them want to work at Cloudflare (including some of those who have been at the company for many years). And then, we also heard from readers by asking the question on <a href="https://twitter.com/Cloudflare/status/1555557749307719680">our Twitter</a> account: “What’s your favorite blog post from the Cloudflare Blog and why?”</p>

To launch one of our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/privacy">Privacy</a> Weeks, in 2020, here’s a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-privacy"><b>general view</b></a> to the three different phases of the Internet. Until the 1990s the race was for connectivity. With the introduction of SSL in 1994, the Internet moved to a second phase where security became paramount (it helped create the dotcom rush and the secure, online world we live in today). Now, it’s all about the Phase 3 of the Internet we’re helping to build: always on, always secure, always private.</p>

			<p><b>Introducing DNS Resolver, 1.1.1.1 (not a joke) (</b><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-resolver-1-1-1-1"><b>✍️</b></a> <b>2018).</b>The first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released, our DNS resolver, <a href="https://1.1.1.1">1.1.1.1</a> — a recursive DNS service — was <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111">launched</a> on April 1, 2018, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-resolver-1-1-1-1"><b>this is</b></a> the technical explanation. With this offering, we started fixing the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. And, just this month, we’ve added <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network">privacy proofed features</a> (a geolocation accuracy “pizza test” included).</p>

			<p><b>Cloudflare goes InterPlanetary - Introducing Cloudflare’s IPFS Gateway (</b><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway"><b>✍️</b></a> <b>2018).</b>We <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway"><b>introduced</b></a> Cloudflare’s IPFS Gateway, an easy way to access content from the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This served as the platform for many new, at the time, highly-reliable and security-enhanced web applications. It was the first product to be released as part of our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway">Distributed Web Gateway</a> project and is a different perspective from the traditional web.IPFS is a peer-to-peer file system composed of thousands of computers around the world, each of which stores files on behalf of the network. And, yes, it can be used as a method for a possible Mars (Moon, etc.) Internet in the future. About that, the same goes for code that will need to be running on Mars, something we mention about Workers <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-unleashed">here</a>.</p>

			<p><b><b><b>Introducing Cloudflare Workers (</b></b></b><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers"><b><b><b>✍️</b></b></b></a><b><b> </b></b><b><b><b>2017).</b></b></b>There are several announcements each year, but <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers">this blog</a> (associated with the explanation, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-everywhere-cloudflare-workers">Code Everywhere: Why We Built Cloudflare Workers</a>) was referenced this week by some as one of those with a clear impact. It was when we started making <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network">Cloudflare's network</a> programmable. In 2018, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-unleashed">Workers</a> was available to everyone and, in 2019, we registered the trademark for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-network-is-the-computer">The Network is the Computer®</a>, to encompass how Cloudflare is using its network to pave the way for the future of the Internet.</p>
