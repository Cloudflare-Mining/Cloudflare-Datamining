	<p>CloudFlare's Network Engineer, Tom Paseka, will be in Hong Kong at the end of August. During his time there, we wanted to host a meetup for CloudFlare users and anyone interested in web performance and security.</p>
	<p>The event will include a short presentation on what's new at CloudFlare, features we've added, and a preview of what's on the roadmap. Afterwards, Tom will answer any questions that you may have.</p>
	<p>If you're a CloudFlare user, come introduce yourself to Tom. If you're not a CloudFlare customer, but interested in web performance and security, then you are welcome to join as well. We look forward to meeting our users and friends from China!</p>
