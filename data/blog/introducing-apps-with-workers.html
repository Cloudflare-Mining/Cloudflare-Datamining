	<p>Since its inception, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps">Cloudflare Apps</a> has made it possible for website owners to install a tool or a service directly onto a domain they have that lives on the Cloudflare network. &nbsp;As an App Developer, you’ve had the ability to deliver your product by modifying traffic and content of a user’s website using a combination of Javascript, HTML, CSS injection with the ability to modify Cloudflare features such as DNS.</p>
	<p>Today we are announcing a public beta for our Cloudflare Apps with Workers! &nbsp;If you are a developer who has been using Workers or Cloudflare Apps, this is a significant step forward to bring together our server-less platform allowing you the next wave of innovation in the Cloudflare marketplace.</p>
	<p>Wait! &nbsp;Yet more Workers news? &nbsp;It’s already been a furious year of releases for Workers, from our GA launch in February to numerous improvements including the beta of Cache API and a flurry of updates during Cloudflare’s Birthday week, where we made available our K/V Storage and WASM support. &nbsp;With this beta, developers can now package all Workers capabilities, deliver new worker-powered experiences to Cloudflare customers all within a few clicks via Cloudflare Apps.</p>
	<p>Now your Apps can be more powerful, and Workers code running on the Cloudflare network are the engine that can take you there. &nbsp; If you’ve successfully built and deployed a worker on your own domain, you can package it as an App and bring your idea to the Cloudflare Marketplace. &nbsp;</p>

	<p>To package a Worker in your App as an additional resource in your <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/developer/docs/install-json"><i>install.json</i></a>, simply add a reference to your Worker script similar to how <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/developer/docs/dns">DNS entries</a> were declared before.</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">{
	"resources": [...],
	"hooks": [...],
	"workers": [{
		"src": "./worker.js"
	}]
}</code></pre>
	<p>You can also deliver custom variables as <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/developer/docs/environment">install options</a> which can then be referenced in Workers; useful for apps who may need to include a service specific token at App install time.</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">// inside src/worker.js
addEventListener('fetch', event =&gt; {
  event.respondWith(workerFn(event.request))
  let someOptionFromInstall = INSTALL_OPTIONS.UserAgents // UserAgents was selected by siteowner in previewer
})</code></pre>

	<p>As before, when you submit your app for approval and review, the submission process will gather your app &nbsp;and worker &nbsp;sources and make it available for our Moderation Team to review. &nbsp;Once successfully through the Moderation process, you can expect an additional Security Review of your Worker, before this app will be made available just like any App is today.</p>
