In an attempt to prevent cheating on these exams, governments in the countries have taken to implementing wide-scale Internet shutdowns covering time periods just before and during the exams. We have covered these shutdowns in the past, including <a href=\"/sudans-exam-related-internet-shutdowns/\">Sudan</a> and <a href=\"/syria-exam-related-internet-shutdowns/\">Syria</a> in 2021 and <a href=\"/syria-sudan-algeria-exam-internet-shutdown/\">Syria, Sudan, and Algeria</a> in 2022.

Unfortunately, this refusal was short-lived, with shutdowns ultimately starting two weeks later.</p><p>In Iraq, two sets of shutdowns were observed: one impacted networks nationwide, except for the Kurdistan Region, while the other impacted networks within the Kurdistan Region. The former set of shutdowns were related to 9th and 12th grade exams, and were scheduled to occur from June 1 through July 15, between 04:00 and 08:00 local time (01:00 - 05:00 UTC). The graphs below show that during June, shutdowns took place on June 1, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 25, and 26, resulting in significant disruptions to Internet connectivity. The shutdowns were implemented across a number of network providers, including <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as203214\">AS203214 (HulumTele</a>), <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as59588\">AS59588 (Zain)</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as199739\">AS199739 (Earthlink)</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as203735\">AS203735 (Net Tech)</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as51684\">AS51684 (Asiacell)</a>, and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as58322\">AS58322 (Halasat)</a>.

The providers impacted by disruptions caused by unexpected or unavoidable events such as cable cuts or severe weather generally try to minimize the scope and duration of such disruptions, ultimately limiting the economic impact. However, in the case of government-directed Internet shutdowns, the damage to the economy is ultimately self-inflicted.
