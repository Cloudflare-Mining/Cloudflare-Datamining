The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2024\">UEFA Euro 2024</a>, running from June 14 to July 14, 2024, significantly impacts Internet traffic across participating European nations. This blog post focuses on the two finalists, Spain and England, and comes after an <a href=\"/how-uefa-euro-2024-football-games-impact-internet-traffic\">initial post we published</a> during the first week of the tournament.</p><p>Analyzing traffic patterns reveals distinct high-level trends. Spain saw the most significant drops in Internet traffic during games against major teams and former champions such as Italy (the defending champion), Germany, and France. In contrast, England’s games had crucial moments towards the end, leading to the largest traffic reductions in the UK, especially during the knockout stages.</p><p>For context, as <a href=\"/how-uefa-euro-2024-football-games-impact-internet-traffic\">previously mentioned</a>, football games like the <a href=\"/tag/super-bowl\">Super Bowl</a>, differ from other events such as <a href=\"/tag/election-security\">elections</a>. When major teams or national squads play, especially in matches that captivate many viewers, Internet traffic often drops. This is particularly true if the game is broadcast on a national TV channel. During such broadcasts, people tend to focus more on their TV sets, relying on the traditional broadcast signal rather than online streaming, especially for games that aren’t behind a paywall. This is a typical scenario when national teams play in Europe.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"semifinals-differences-between-four-countries\">Semifinals: differences between four countries</h3>\n      <a href=\"#semifinals-differences-between-four-countries\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Let’s first analyze the impact of the semifinals on the four countries with national teams playing, using UK-related data for England.
