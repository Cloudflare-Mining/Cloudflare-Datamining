CNI allows our customers to interconnect branch and HQ locations directly with Cloudflare wherever they are, bringing Cloudflare’s full suite of network functions to their physical network edge. Using CNI to interconnect provides security, reliability, and performance benefits vs. using the public Internet to connect to Cloudflare. And because of Cloudflare’s global network reach, connecting to our network is straightforward no matter where on the planet your infrastructure and employees are.</p><p>At its most basic level, an interconnect is a link between two networks. Today, we’re offering customers the following options to interconnect with Cloudflare’s network:</p><ul><li><p>Via a private network interconnect (PNI). A physical cable (or a virtual “pseudo-wire”; more on that later) that connects two networks.</p></li><li><p>Over an Internet Exchange (IX). A common switch fabric where multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Internet networks can interconnect with each other.</p></li></ul><p>To use a real world analogy: Cloudflare over the years has built a network of highways across the Internet to handle all our customers&#39; traffic. We’re now providing dedicated on-ramps for our customers’ on-prem networks to get onto those highways.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"why-interconnect-with-cloudflare\">Why interconnect with Cloudflare?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#why-interconnect-with-cloudflare\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>CNI provides more reliable, faster, and more private connectivity between your infrastructure and Cloudflare’s. This delivers benefits across our product suite. Here are some examples of specific products and how you can combine them with CNI:</p><ul><li><p><b>Cloudflare Access</b>: Cloudflare Access replaces corporate VPNs with Cloudflare’s network. Instead of placing internal tools on a private network, teams deploy them in any environment, including hybrid or multi-cloud models, and secure them consistently with Cloudflare’s network. CNI allows you to bring your own <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mpls/\">MPLS network</a> to meet ours, allowing your employees to connect to your network <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/\">securely</a> and quickly no matter where they are.</p></li><li><p><b>CDN</b>: Cloudflare’s CDN places content closer to visitors, improving site speed while minimizing origin load. CNI improves cache fill performance and reduces costs.</p></li><li><p><b>Magic Transit</b>: Magic Transit protects datacenter and branch networks from unwanted attack and malicious traffic. Pairing Magic Transit with CNI decreases jitter and drives throughput improvements, and further hardens infrastructure from attack.</p></li><li><p><b>Cloudflare Workers</b>: Workers is Cloudflare’s serverless compute platform. Integrating with CNI provides a secure connection to serverless cloud compute that does not traverse the public Internet, allowing customers to use Cloudflare’s unique set of Workers services with tighter network performance tolerances.</p></li></ul><p>Let’s talk more about how CNI delivers these benefits.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"improving-performance-through-interconnection\">Improving performance through interconnection</h2>\n            <a href=\"#improving-performance-through-interconnection\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>CNI is a great way to boost performance for many existing Cloudflare products.

Many of our customers rely on our CDN to make their HTTP applications more responsive.</p><p>Cloudflare caches content very close to end users to provide the best performance possible. But, if content is not in cache, Cloudflare edge PoPs must contact the origin server to retrieve cacheable content. This can be slow, and places more load on an origin server compared to serving directly from cache.</p><p>With CNI, these origin pulls can be completed over a dedicated link, improving throughput and reducing overall time needed for origin pulls. Using Argo Tiered Cache, customers can manage tiered cache topologies and specify upstream cache tiers that correspond with locations where network interconnects are in place. Using Tiered Cache in this fashion lowers origin loads and increases cache hit rates, thereby improving performance and reducing origin infrastructures costs.</p><p>Here’s anonymized and sampled data from a real Cloudflare customer who recently provisioned interconnections between our network and theirs to further improve performance. Heavy users of our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/\">CDN</a>, they were able to shave off precious milliseconds from their origin <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/round-trip-time-rtt/\">round trip time (RTT)</a> by adding PNIs in multiple locations.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/287Nl0Br3mV3gk7LaJldXK/533d139d62445b94c351bf1279a1cccc/Htmu4K3SVLYb5MLATaPHr1qv1aXV4033MS-rSKi8dKF4R8QUpW5mz7r0sOIhn94-4ljQm7fgnp0xXpqklh2tSM970ysEefBv5U66_Dci7Kw0setb3dzHqsV0rkJP.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"598\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As an example, their 90th percentile round trip time in Warsaw, Poland decreased by 6.5ms as a result of provisioning a private network interconnect (from 7.5ms to 1ms), which is a performance win of 87%!  The jitter (variation in delay in received packets) on the link decreased from 82.9 to 0.3, which speaks to the dedicated, reliable nature of the link.

When traffic arrives, it’s filtered and sent along to customers’ data centers. Before CNI, all Magic Transit traffic was sent from Cloudflare to customers via Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels over the Internet. Because GRE endpoints are publicly routable, there is some risk these endpoints could be discovered and attacked, bypassing Cloudflare’s DDoS mitigation and security tools.</p><p>Using CNI removes this exposure to the Internet. Advantages of using CNI with Magic Transit include:</p><ul><li><p><b>Reduced threat exposure</b>. Although there are many steps companies can take to increase network security, some risk-sensitive organizations prefer not to expose endpoints to the public Internet at all. CNI allows Cloudflare to absorb that risk and forward only clean traffic (via Magic Transit) through a truly private interface.</p></li><li><p><b>Increased reliability</b>. Traffic traveling over the public Internet is subject to factors outside of your control, including latency and packet loss on intermediate networks.

To minimize costs, they limit their network egress points to two worldwide.  This creates a major performance problem for their users, whose bits have to travel a long way to accomplish basic tasks while still traversing Penguin’s network boundary.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3TUgsWNvoBS5Hawy0cMQYw/c1565c1a37cdddb871e0464242aa7f65/_phA04NIplQYLGFp6NKPYCagymhemaHQBhFlYT_cX7lxV0QgVMt4g_W7eELJIfSufyH0iPiQZzWPQATMDHSul5Wcv3pDHTNqZI4wkTxcv787Lko8-F6cnGhXqaAy.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"931\" height=\"521\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/\">SASE (Secure Access Service Edge)</a> models look attractive to them, because they can, in theory, move away from their traditional MPLS network and move towards the cloud.  SASE deployments provide firewall, DDoS mitigation, and encryption services at the network edge, and bring security as a service to any cloud deployment, as seen in the diagram below:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5bwvqPDkbxBDPVfgJQSZ1g/326d5142f02a3d6c87efda8367a02f8f/4nyBvpgo5-gvehuP51_4TIU_LPPADT3Dw3Tw4HvdMxxbuPAYgz-ewgbg8ervMqgP_eQgf94Vl7MQdzqeu7LtIlAHuAlGpg1LOa35WmUbFQvvX6PD3lnwk0eMhBGe.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"931\" height=\"329\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>CNI allows Penguin to use Cloudflare as their true network edge, hermetically sealing their branch office locations and datacenters from the Internet. Penguin can adapt to a SASE-like model while keeping exposure to the public Internet at zero. Penguin establishes PNIs with Cloudflare from their branch office in San Jose to Cloudflare’s San Jose location to take advantage of Cloudflare for Teams, and from their core colocation facility in Austin to Cloudflare’s Dallas location to use Magic Transit to protect their core networks.</p><p>Like Magic Transit, Cloudflare for Teams replaces traditional security hardware on-premise with Cloudflare’s global network. Customers who relied on VPN appliances to reach internal applications can instead connect securely through Cloudflare Access. Organizations maintaining physical web gateway boxes can send Internet-bound traffic to Cloudflare Gateway for filtering and logging.</p><p>Cloudflare for Teams services run in every Cloudflare data center, bringing filtering and authentication closer to your users and locations to avoid compromising performance. CNI improves that even further with a direct connection from your offices to Cloudflare. With a simple configuration change, all branch traffic reaches Cloudflare’s edge where Cloudflare for Teams policies can be applied. The link improves speed and reliability for users and replaces the need to backhaul traffic to centralized filtering appliances.</p><p>Once interconnected this way, Penguin’s network and employees realize two benefits:</p><ol><li><p>They get to use Cloudflare’s full set of security services without having to provision expensive and centralized physical or virtualized network appliances.</p></li><li><p>Their security and performance services are running across Cloudflare’s global network in over 200 cities. This brings performance and usability improvements for users by putting security functions closer to them.</p></li></ol>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4IBu3f64CyIACsK0f396K7/84f7ade0b504288e930c9a711b4d10c7/PVOb8h-7FT_nAHjY8nZ8RX8equpfCMRCj260_6anOjpmSvMbDc9W5AtUGXH-91k3EVpw8fyeEwPVsR2O--gs1AchU3kvLS10JwvWnHaKBcTw0nLj2iGogXcPApCu.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"931\" height=\"329\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"scalable-global-and-flexible-interconnection-options\">Scalable, global, and flexible interconnection options</h2>\n            <a href=\"#scalable-global-and-flexible-interconnection-options\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>CNI offers a big benefit to customers because it allows them to take advantage of our global footprint spanning 200+ cities: their branch office and datacenter infrastructure can connect to Cloudflare wherever they are.</p><p>This matters for two reasons: our globally distributed network makes it easier to interconnect locally, no matter where a customer’s branches and core infrastructure is, and allows for a globally distributed workforce to interact with our edge network with low latency and improved performance.</p><p><b>Customers don’t have to worry about securely expanding their network footprint: that’s our job.</b></p><p>To this point, global companies need to interconnect at <i>many</i> points around the world.
