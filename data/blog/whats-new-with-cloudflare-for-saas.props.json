This ensures traffic gets to the right place, and it allows the SaaS provider to make infrastructure changes without involving your end customers.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1e65t2gMZxa81OVQ04OhHb/69605839a139551e01feca1b7c52a55d/image4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1122\" height=\"352\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We kept this in mind when we built our SSL for SaaS a few years ago. SSL for SaaS takes away the burden of certificate issuance and management from the SaaS provider by proxying traffic through Cloudflare’s edge. All the SaaS provider needs to do is onboard their zone to Cloudflare and ask their end customers to create a CNAME to the SaaS zone — something they were already doing.</p><p>The big benefit of giving your customers a CNAME record (instead of a fixed IP address) is that it gives you, the SaaS provider, more flexibility and control. It allows you to seamlessly change the IP address of your server in the background. For example, if your IP gets blocked by ISP providers, you can update that address on your customers’ behalf with a CNAME record. With a fixed A record, you rely on each of your customers to make a change.</p><p>While the CNAME record works great for most customers, some came back and wanted to bypass the limitation that CNAME records present. RFC 1912 states that CNAME records cannot coexist with other DNS records, so in most cases, you cannot have a CNAME at the root of your domain, e.g. example.com. Instead, the CNAME needs to exist at the subdomain level, i.e. <a href=\"http://www.example.com\">www.example.com</a>. Some DNS providers (including Cloudflare) bypass this restriction through a method called <a href=\"/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/\">CNAME flattening</a>.</p><p>Since SaaS providers have no control over the DNS provider that their customers are using, the feedback they got from their customers was that they wanted to use the apex of their zone and not the subdomain. So when our SaaS customers came back asking us for a solution, we delivered. We call it Apex Proxying.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"apex-proxying\">Apex Proxying</h3>\n            <a href=\"#apex-proxying\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>For our SaaS customers who want to allow their customers to proxy their apex to their zone, regardless of which DNS provider they are using, we give them the option of Apex Proxying. Apex Proxying is an SSL for SaaS feature that gives SaaS providers a pair of IP addresses to provide to their customers when CNAME records do not work for them.</p><p>Cloudflare starts by allocating a dedicated set of IPs for the SaaS provider. The SaaS provider then gives their customers these IPs that they can add as A or AAAA DNS records, allowing them to proxy traffic directly from the apex of their zone.</p><p>While this works for most, some of our customers want more flexibility. They want to have multiple IPs that they can change, or they want to assign different sets of customers to different buckets of IPs. For those customers, we give them the option to bring their own IP range, so they control the IP allocation for their application.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7bZIm6ydNUeN8pbEhNnzlW/27bb817711720689ce6ac6c1c2b03f43/image1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1114\" height=\"518\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"bring-your-own-ips\">Bring Your Own IPs</h3>\n            <a href=\"#bring-your-own-ips\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Last year, we announced <a href=\"/bringing-your-own-ips-to-cloudflare-byoip/\">Bring Your Own IP</a> (BYOIP), which allows customers to bring their own IP range for Cloudflare to announce at our edge.

Cloudflare allows SaaS providers to upload their customers’ certificates to any of their custom hostnames — in just one API call!</p><p>Some SaaS providers never want a person to see private key material, but want to be able to use the CA of their choice. They can do so by generating a <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/ssl-for-saas/certificate-signing-requests\">Certificate Signing Request (CSR)</a> for their Custom Hostnames, and then either use those CSRs themselves to order certificates for their customers or relay the CSRs to their customers so that they can provision their own certificates. In either case, the SaaS provider is able to then upload the certificate for the Custom Hostname after the certificate has been issued from their customer’s CA for use at Cloudflare’s edge.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"custom-metadata\">Custom Metadata</h3>\n            <a href=\"#custom-metadata\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>For our customers who need to customize their configuration to handle specific rules for their customer’s domains, they can do so by using <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/ssl-for-saas/hostname-specific-behavior/custom-metadata\">Custom Metadata and Workers</a>.</p><p>By adding metadata to an individual custom hostname and then deploying a Worker to read the data, you can use the Worker to customize per-hostname behavior.</p><p>Some customers use this functionality to add a customer_id field to each custom hostname that they then send in a request header to their origin.
