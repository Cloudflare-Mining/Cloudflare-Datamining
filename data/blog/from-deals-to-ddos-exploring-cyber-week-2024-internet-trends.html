	<p>In 2024, Thanksgiving (November 28), Black Friday (November 29), and Cyber Monday (December 2) significantly impacted Internet traffic, similar to trends seen <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cyber-week-analyzing-internet-traffic-and-e-commerce-trends"><u>in 2023</u></a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/ecommerce"><u>previous years</u></a>. This year, Thanksgiving in the US drove a 20% drop in daily traffic compared to the previous week, with a notable 33% dip at 15:45 ET. In contrast, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-truth-about-black-friday-and-cyber-monday">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a> drove traffic spikes. But how global is this trend, and do attacks increase during Cyber Week?</p>
	<p>At Cloudflare, we manage and protect a substantial amount of traffic for our customers, providing a unique vantage point to analyze traffic and attack patterns across the Internet. This perspective reveals insights like Cyber Monday being the busiest Internet traffic day of 2024 globally, followed by Black Friday, with patterns varying across countries. Notably, global HTTP request volume on Cyber Monday 2024 was 36% higher than 2023, with 5% of that traffic blocked as potential attacks.</p>
	<p>For this analysis, we examined anonymized and aggregated HTTP requests and DNS queries across our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network"><u>network</u></a> to uncover key patterns. Cyber Monday, December 2, was the day with peak traffic, and key findings for that day include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Cloudflare processed a peak of 99.8 million HTTP requests per second at 15:33 UTC on Cyber Monday, December 2.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Cloudflare handled approximately 5.4 trillion daily requests on Cyber Monday, with blocked potential attacks comprising around 5% of all traffic. This was higher than the 5.1 trillion daily requests on Black Friday, where 6% of request traffic consisted of blocked potential attacks.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Daily global HTTP request volume on Cyber Monday 2024 (December 2) increased by 36% compared to Cyber Monday 2023. In comparison, Cyber Monday 2023 had shown a 27% increase over Cyber Monday 2022.</p>

	<p>This year’s trends, like those observed in previous years, show how Internet traffic typically peaks in late November but tends to drop in December. In 2024, Cyber Monday was again the busiest day for global Internet traffic. However, Black Friday didn’t make the Top 3, as Sunday, December 1, and Tuesday, November 26, saw higher traffic. Black Friday ranked #5, coming behind November 21.

		<i>Note: On December 1, 2024, a customer-specific software update event contributed to the increased Internet traffic observed that day, including at the country level.</i>

	<p>Additionally, most US states show a similar trend, with Cyber Monday generating the most traffic, followed by Sunday, December 1, and Black Friday, November 29. Arizona, West Virginia, and Arkansas saw increases in traffic of over 20% compared to the previous week. Almost all other states experienced traffic increases exceeding 10%, including some of the most populous ones like California (11%), Florida (11%), and New York (11%).</p>
	<p>In looking at just traffic to Shopping and Retail sites based in the US that use Cloudflare, Cyber Monday recorded the highest traffic, followed by Black Friday and the Black Friday weekend. Traffic to these sites increased significantly during Cyber Week, starting on Monday, November 25, with a 7% increase compared to the previous week and a 57% jump compared to the first week of November.</p>

	<p>During Thanksgiving Day, mobile usage in the US increased significantly, with mobile device traffic accounting for 51.7% of all traffic, compared to 42.4% the previous week. The trend intensified on Black Friday, with mobile’s share peaking at 51.9% (up from 43.9% the prior Friday) and reaching a similar level on Saturday, November 30, at 52%. However, Cyber Monday saw a shift to desktop use, with mobile device share dropping to 43.4%, lower than the previous Monday. This mirrors a similar trend observed in 2023.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>These patterns suggest that Black Friday shopping in the US often involves more out of home/office activities, with people relying on mobile devices for Internet access while on the go, whereas the opposite tends to occur on Cyber Monday, a day when many return to work and school in the US.</p>

	<p>Aggregated data from our <a href="https://1.1.1.1"><u>1.1.1.1</u></a> resolver reveals category-specific DNS traffic growth to E-commerce sites, showing a steady increase throughout November, similar to the overall Internet traffic trends.</p>
	<p>In the US, E-commerce DNS traffic in November 2024 followed a similar pattern compared to 2023. Black Friday (November 29) ranked as the top day for DNS traffic in the E-commerce category, followed closely by Cyber Monday and Tuesday, November 26. This aligns more closely with overall US Internet traffic trends, where Cyber Monday ranked #1.</p>

	<p>Focusing on the US again, so-called “low-cost” E-commerce sites (which include recent entrants like Temu and fast-fashion brands) have become increasingly popular, and experienced more DNS traffic in the days leading up to Black Friday and Thanksgiving, specifically November 26 and 27. Cyber Monday ranked third.</p>

	<p>DDoS (<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack"><u>distributed denial-of-service</u></a>) attacks remain a common tactic for disrupting Internet properties. Our data shows that Shopping and Retail sites in the United States protected by Cloudflare experienced a significant rise in DDoS activity on Cyber Monday. On that day, 7% of all traffic in this category was mitigated as DDoS attacks, with an additional 8% flagged as potential threats.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>More broadly, DDoS activity targeting the US in general (not limited to E-commerce) also spiked during Black Friday week. Starting November 24, the share blocked as DDoS attacks rose sharply, peaking at over 2% of all traffic on November 25. Across the entire Cyber Week, there was a 41% increase in blocked DDoS attack requests compared to the previous week.</p>

	<p>From a cybersecurity perspective, trending events, topics, and individuals often trigger spikes in email traffic, including malicious, phishing, and spam messages. This was evident during the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/paris-2024-olympics-recap"><u>Paris 2024 Olympics</u></a>, the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/exploring-internet-traffic-shifts-and-cyber-attacks-during-the-2024-us-election"><u>US elections</u></a>, and shopping periods like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Between November 1 and December 2, 2024, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security"><u>Cloudflare’s Cloud Email Security</u></a> service processed nearly 24 million emails mentioning “Black Friday” or “Cyber Monday” in the subject. Of those, 19.4 million referenced “Black Friday” while 4.2 million mentioned “Cyber Monday”, with 76% (3.2 million) of the Cyber Monday emails sent on December 2, 2024.</p>
	<p>During this period, “Black Friday” emails were not only higher volume but also showed higher percentages of spam (10.8%) and malicious content (0.9%) compared to emails mentioning “Cyber Monday” in the subject, which had 1.8% spam and 0.2% malicious content.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>In the next chart, we focus on emails with “Black Friday” in the subject, given that it generated the highest percentage of spam and malicious emails. Spam emails peaked in mid-November, making up 29% of all emails, and reached 26% on Cyber Monday. Malicious email percentages were also higher in mid-November, with 3% recorded on November 14, before Black Friday week.</p>

	<p>Internet traffic trends during Black Friday and Cyber Monday show varying patterns globally and regionally. Cyber Monday leads in traffic overall, followed closely by Black Friday. While the US and Canada share similar trends, countries like the UK, Germany, and Australia saw traffic higher on Black Friday than Cyber Monday. In most countries, activity also increased in the days leading up to Black Friday.</p>
	<p>On the cybersecurity front, DDoS attacks were more noticeable during Cyber Week in 2024, especially targeting shopping-related sites.</p>
