	<p>Welcome to the 21st edition of the Cloudflare DDoS Threat Report. Published quarterly, this report offers a comprehensive analysis of the evolving threat landscape of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service"><u>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks</u></a> based on data from the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network"><u>Cloudflare network</u></a>. In this edition, we focus on the first quarter of 2025. To view previous reports, visit <a href="http://www.ddosreport.com"><u>www.ddosreport.com</u></a>.</p>
	<p>While this report primarily focuses on 2025 Q1, it also includes late-breaking data from a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#hyper-volumetric-ddos-attacks">hyper-volumetric DDoS campaign observed in April 2025</a>, featuring some of the largest attacks ever publicly disclosed. In a historic surge of activity, we blocked the most intense packet rate attack on record, peaking at 4.8 billion packets per second (Bpps), 52% higher than the previous benchmark, and separately defended against a massive 6.5 terabits-per-second (Tbps) flood, matching the highest bandwidth attacks ever reported.</p>

			<p>In the first quarter of 2025, Cloudflare blocked 20.5 million DDoS attacks. That represents a 358% year-over-year (YoY) increase and a 198% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase.&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Around one third of those, 6.6 million, targeted the Cloudflare network infrastructure directly, as part of an 18-day multi-vector attack campaign.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Furthermore, in the first quarter of 2025, Cloudflare blocked approximately 700 hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks that exceeded 1 Tbps or 1 Bpps — an average of around 8 attacks per day.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All the attacks were blocked by our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos"><u>autonomous defenses</u></a>.</p>

	<p>In the first quarter of 2025, we blocked 20.5 million DDoS attacks. For comparison, during the calendar year 2024, we blocked 21.3 million DDoS attacks. In just this past quarter, we blocked 96% of what we blocked in 2024.</p>
	<p>The most significant increase was in network-layer DDoS attacks. In 2025 Q1, we blocked 16.8M network-layer DDoS attacks. That’s a 397% QoQ increase and a 509% YoY increase. HTTP DDoS attacks also increased — a 7% QoQ increase and a 118% YoY increase.</p>

	<p>We count DDoS attacks based on unique real-time fingerprints generated by our systems. In some instances, a single attack or campaign may generate multiple fingerprints, particularly when different mitigation strategies are applied. While this can occasionally lead to higher counts, the metric offers a strong overall indicator of attack activity during a given period.</p>

	<p>Hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks are attacks that exceed 1-2 Tbps or 1 Bpps. In 2025 Q1, we blocked over 700 of these attacks. Approximately 4 out of every 100,000 network-layer DDoS attacks were hyper-volumetric. Hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks tend to take place over <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp"><u>UDP</u></a>.</p>

	<p>While this report primarily focuses on 2025 Q1, we believe it is important to also highlight the significant hyper-volumetric record-breaking DDoS attacks that continued into Q2. As such, we have included initial insights from that campaign.</p>
	<p>In the second half of April 2025, Cloudflare’s systems automatically detected and blocked dozens of hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks as part of an intense campaign. The largest attacks peaked at 4.8 Bpps and 6.5 Tbps, with these massive surges typically lasting between 35 and 45 seconds. At 6.5 Tbps, this attack matches the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eleven11bot-botnet-record-size-ddos-attacks"><u>largest publicly disclosed DDoS attack</u></a> to date. The 4.8 Bpps attack is the largest ever to be disclosed from the packet intensity perspective, approximately 52% larger than the previous 3.15 Bpps record.</p>

	<p>When surveying Cloudflare customers that were targeted by DDoS attacks, the majority said they didn’t know who attacked them. The ones that did know reported their competitors as the number one threat actor behind the attacks (39%), which is similar to last quarter. This is quite common in the gaming and gambling industry.</p>
	<p>Another 17% reported that a state-level or state-sponsored threat actor was behind the attack, and a similar percentage reported that a disgruntled user or customer was behind the attack.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Another 11% reported that they mistakenly inflicted the DDoS attack on themselves (self-DDoS) and a similar percentage said an extortionist was behind the attacks. 6% reported that the attacks were launched by disgruntled or former employees.</p>

	<p>In 2025 Q1, we saw a 3,488% QoQ increase in CLDAP reflection/amplification attacks. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1798"><u>CLDAP (Connectionless Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)</u></a> is a variant of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4511"><u>LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)</u></a>, used for querying and modifying directory services running over IP networks. CLDAP is connectionless, using UDP instead of TCP, making it faster but less reliable. Because it uses UDP, there’s no handshake requirement, which allows attackers to spoof the source IP address, thus allowing attackers to exploit it as a reflection vector. In these attacks, small queries are sent with a spoofed source IP address (the victim's IP), causing servers to send large responses to the victim, overwhelming it. Mitigation involves filtering and monitoring unusual CLDAP traffic.</p>

	<p>We also saw a 2,301% QoQ increase in ESP reflection/amplification attacks. The ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) protocol is part of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec"><u>IPsec</u></a> and provides confidentiality, authentication, and integrity to network communications. However, it can be abused in DDoS attacks if malicious actors exploit misconfigured or vulnerable systems to reflect or amplify traffic towards a target, leading to service disruption. Like with other protocols, securing and properly configuring the systems using ESP is crucial to block the risks of DDoS attacks.</p>

	<p>Despite the increase in hyper-volumetric attacks, most DDoS attacks are small. In 2025 Q1, 99% of Layer 3/4 DDoS attacks were under 1 Gbps and 1 Mpps. Similarly, 94% of HTTP DDoS attacks were 1 million requests per second (rps). However, ‘small’ is a relative term and most Internet properties wouldn’t be able to withstand even those small attacks. They can easily saturate unprotected Internet links and crash unprotected servers.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, most attacks are very short-lived. 89% of Layer 3/4 DDoS attacks and 75% of HTTP DDoS attacks end within 10 minutes. Even the largest, record-breaking, hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks can be very short, such as the 35-second attack seen in the examples above. 35 seconds, or even 10 minutes, is not a sufficient time for manual mitigation or activating an on-demand solution: by the time a security analyst receives the alert, and analyzes the attack, it’s already over. And while the attacks may be very short, the trickle effect of attack leads to network and applications failures that can take days to recover from — all whilst services are down or degraded. The current threat landscape leaves no time for human intervention. Detection and mitigation should be always-on, in-line and automated — with sufficient capacity and global coverage to handle the attack traffic along with legitimate peak time traffic.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>On the other hand, hyper-volumetric HTTP DDoS attacks that exceed 1 Mrps doubled their share. In 2025 Q1, 6 out of every 100 HTTP DDoS attacks exceeded 1 Mrps. On the network-layer, 1 out of every 100,000 attacks exceeded 1 Tbps or 1 Bpps.</p>

	<p>One example of such an attack targeted a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit"><u>Cloudflare Magic Transit</u></a> customer. The customer itself is a US-based hosting provider that offers web servers, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/video/what-is-voip"><u>Voice over IP (VoIP)</u></a> servers, and game servers amongst its solutions. This specific attack targeted port 27015. This port is most commonly associated with multiplayer gaming servers, especially Valve's Source engine games, such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), Team Fortress 2, Garry's Mod, Left 4 Dead, and Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.</p>
	<p>It's used for the game server connection, letting clients connect to the server to play online. In many cases, this port is open for both UDP and TCP, depending on the game and what kind of communication it's doing. This customer was targeted with multiple hyper-volumetric attacks that were autonomously blocked by Cloudflare.</p>

	<p>An <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system"><u>ASN (Autonomous System Number)</u></a> is a unique identifier assigned to a network or group of IP networks that operate under a single routing policy on the Internet. It’s used to exchange routing information between systems using protocols like <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp"><u>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)</u></a>.</p>
	<p>When looking at where the DDoS attacks originate from, specifically HTTP DDoS attacks, there are a few autonomous systems that stand out. In 2025 Q1, the German-based <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as24940"><u>Hetzner (AS24940)</u></a> retained its position as the largest source of HTTP DDoS attacks. It was followed by the French-based <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as16276"><u>OVH (AS16276)</u></a> in second, the US-based <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as14061"><u>DigitalOcean (AS14061)</u></a> in third, and another German-based provider, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as51167"><u>Contabo (AS51167)</u></a>, in fourth.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Other major sources included the China-based <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as4134"><u>ChinaNet Backbone (AS4134)</u></a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as132203"><u>Tencent (AS132203)</u></a>, the Austrian-based <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as200373"><u>Drei (AS200373)</u></a>, and three US-based providers to wrap up the top 10 — <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as8075"><u>Microsoft (AS8075)</u></a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as31898"><u>Oracle (AS31898)</u></a>, and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as396982"><u>Google Cloud Platform (AS396982)</u></a>. Most of the networks in this ranking are well-known cloud computing or hosting providers, highlighting how cloud infrastructure is frequently leveraged — either intentionally or through exploitation — for launching DDoS attacks.</p>
	<p>To help hosting providers, cloud computing providers and any Internet service providers identify and take down the abusive accounts that launch these attacks, we leverage Cloudflare’s unique vantage point to provide a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/botnet-threat-feed"><u>free DDoS Botnet Threat Feed for Service Providers</u></a>. Over 600 organizations worldwide have already signed up for this feed. It gives service providers a list of offending IP addresses from within their ASN that we see launching HTTP DDoS attacks. It’s completely free and all it takes is opening a free Cloudflare account, authenticating the ASN via <a href="https://docs.peeringdb.com/howto/authenticate"><u>PeeringDB</u></a>, and then <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/botnet-threat-feed/#get-full-report"><u>fetching the threat intelligence via API</u></a>.</p>

	<p>As the threat landscape continues to evolve, we see that many organizations still adopt DDoS protection only after experiencing an attack or rely on outdated, on-demand solutions. In contrast, our data shows that those with proactive security strategies are far more resilient. That’s why we focus on automation and a comprehensive, always-on, in-line security approach to stay ahead of both existing and emerging threats.</p>
	<p>Backed by our global network with 348 Tbps of capacity spanning 335 cities, we remain dedicated to delivering unmetered, unlimited DDoS protection, regardless of the size, duration, or frequency of attacks.</p>
