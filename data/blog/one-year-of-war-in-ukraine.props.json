Tomorrow marks one year since the Russian invasion of that country. This post reports on Internet insights and discusses how Ukraine&#39;s Internet remained resilient in spite of dozens of disruptions in three different stages of the conflict.</p><p>Key takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>Internet traffic shifts in Ukraine are clearly visible from east to west as Ukrainians fled the war, with country-wide traffic dropping as much as 33% after February 24, 2022.</p></li><li><p>Air strikes on energy infrastructure starting in October led to widespread Internet disruptions that continue in 2023.</p></li><li><p>Application-layer cyber attacks in Ukraine rose 1,300% in early March 2022 compared to pre-war levels.</p></li><li><p>Government administration, financial services, and the media saw the most attacks targeting Ukraine.</p></li><li><p>Traffic from a number of networks in Kherson was re-routed through Russia between June and October, subjecting traffic to Russia’s restrictions and limitations, including content filtering. Even after traffic ceased to reroute through Russia, those Ukrainian networks saw major outages through at least the end of the year, while two networks remain offline.</p></li><li><p>Through efforts on the ground to repair damaged fiber optics and restore electrical power, Ukraine’s networks have remained resilient from both an infrastructure and routing perspective. This is partly due to Ukraine’s widespread connectivity to networks outside the country and large number of IXPs.</p></li><li><p>Starlink traffic in Ukraine grew over 500% between mid-March and mid-May, and continued to grow from mid-May through mid-November, increasing nearly 300% over that six-month period. For the full period from mid-March (two weeks after it was made available) to mid-December, it was over a 1,600% increase, dropping a bit after that.</p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"internet-changes-and-disruptions\">Internet changes and disruptions</h2>\n      <a href=\"#internet-changes-and-disruptions\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"an-internet-shock-after-february-24-2022\">An Internet shock after February 24, 2022</h3>\n      <a href=\"#an-internet-shock-after-february-24-2022\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In Ukraine, human Internet traffic dropped as much as 33% in the weeks following February 24.

That said, there were also country-wide outages, mostly after October, that are discussed below.</p><p>14% of total traffic <i>from</i> Ukraine (including traffic from Crimea and other occupied regions) was mitigated as potential attacks, while 10% of total traffic <i>to</i> Ukraine was mitigated as potential attacks in the last 12 months.</p><p>Before February 24, 2022, typical weekday Internet traffic in Ukraine initially peaked after lunch, around 15:00 local time, dropped between 17:00 and 18:00 (consistent with people leaving work), and reached the biggest peak of the day at around 21:00 (possibly after dinner for mobile and streaming use).</p><p>After the invasion started, we observed less variation during the day in a clear change in the usual pattern given the reported disruption and “<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220226-exodus-from-ukraine-a-night-spent-with-civilians-fleeing-war-russia-s-invasion\">exodus</a>” from the country​. During the first few days after the invasion began, peak traffic occurred around 19:00, at a time when nights for many in cities such as Kyiv were spent in improvised underground <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/03/14/inside-kyivs-metro-a-citywide-bomb-shelter\">bunkers</a>. By late March, the 21:00 peak had returned, but the early evening drop in traffic did not return until May.</p><p>When looking at Ukraine Internet requests by type of traffic in the chart below (from February 10, 2022, through February 2023), we observe that while traffic from both mobile and desktop devices dropped after the invasion, request volume from mobile devices has remained higher over the past year. Pre-war, mobile devices accounted for around 53% of traffic, and grew to around 60% during the first weeks of the invasion. By late April, it had returned to typical pre-war levels, falling back to around 54% of traffic. There’s also a noticeable December drop/outage that we’ll go over below.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4jLPx0Ah8ulYoq3oDMICNV/5af0f58479c61e6e13fb8af2781e75de/pasted-image-0--1-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"718\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"millions-moving-from-east-to-west-in-ukraine\">Millions moving from east to west in Ukraine</h3>\n      <a href=\"#millions-moving-from-east-to-west-in-ukraine\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The invasion brought attacks and failing infrastructure across a number of cities, but the target in the early days wasn’t the country’s energy infrastructure, as it was in October 2022. In the first weeks of the war, <a href=\"/internet-traffic-patterns-in-ukraine-since-february-21-2022/\">Internet traffic changes</a> were largely driven by people evacuating conflict zones with their families. Over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_Ukrainian_refugee_crisis\">eight million</a> Ukrainians left the country in the first three months, and many more relocated internally to safer cities, although many returned during the summer of 2022. The Internet played a critical role during this refugee crisis, supporting communications and access to real-time information that could save lives, as well as apps providing services, among others.</p><p>There was also an increase in traffic in the western part of Ukraine, in areas such as Lviv (further away from the conflict areas), and a decrease in the east, in areas like Kharkiv, where the Russian military was arriving and attacks were a constant threat. The figure below provides a view of how Internet traffic across Ukraine changed in the week after the war began (a darker pink means a drop in traffic — as much as 60% — while a darker green indicates an increase in Internet traffic — as much as 50%).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/37b5qs3jPnFkxC1zypMlj0/a6a9222ab47aeb61a7c24bd646889744/Untitled-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1282\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Source: <a href=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dsUSJ/2/\">https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dsUSJ/2/</a></p><p>The biggest drops in Internet traffic observed in Ukraine in the first days of the war were in Kharkiv Oblast in the east, and Chernihiv in the north, both with a 60% decrease, followed by Kyiv Oblast, with traffic 40% lower on March 2, 2022, as compared with February 23.</p><p>In western Ukraine, traffic surged.

The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_occupation_of_Kherson_Oblast\">Russian occupation of Kherson Oblast</a> continued until Ukrainian forces <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_of_Kherson\">resumed control</a> on November 11, after launching a counteroffensive at the end of August.</p><p>On May 4, 2022, we published <a href=\"/tracking-shifts-in-internet-connectivity-in-kherson-ukraine/\"><i>Tracking shifts in Internet connectivity in Kherson, Ukraine</i></a>, a blog post that explored a re-routing event that impacted <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as47598\">AS47598 (Khersontelecom)</a>, a telecommunications provider in Kherson Oblast. Below, we summarize this event, and explore similar activity across other providers in Kherson that has taken place since then.</p><p>On May 1, 2022, we observed a shift in routing for the <a href=\"https://bgpview.io/prefix/91.206.110.0/23\">IPv4 prefix</a> announced by Ukrainian network <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as47598\">AS47598 (Khersontelecom)</a>. During April, it reached the Internet through several other Ukrainian network providers, including <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as12883\">AS12883 (Vega Telecom)</a> and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as3326\">AS3326 (Datagroup)</a>. However, after the shift, its routing path now showed a Russian network, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as201776\">AS201776 (Miranda-Media)</a>, as the sole upstream provider. With traffic from KhersonTelecom passing through a Russian network, it was subject to the restrictions and limitations imposed on any traffic transiting Russian networks, including content filtering.</p><p>The flow of traffic from Khersontelecom before and after May 1, with rerouting through Russian network provider Miranda-Media, is illustrated in the chart below. This particular re-routing event was short-lived, as a routing update for AS47598 on May 4 saw it return to reaching the Internet through other Ukrainian providers.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4OIpRjlvTbltFtWxLX0cIt/479c9f70efa3936b50e97e9c7b7f364b/pasted-image-0--14-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"645\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As a basis for our analysis, we started with a list of 15 Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) belonging to networks in Kherson Oblast. Using that list, we analyzed routing information collected by route-views2 over the past year, from February 1, 2022, to February 15, 2023. route-views2 is a BGP route collector run by the <a href=\"https://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/\">University of Oregon Route Views Project</a>. Note that with respect to the discussions of ASNs in this and the following section, we are treating them equally, and have not specifically factored estimated user population into these analyses.</p><p>The figure below illustrates the result of this analysis, showing that re-routing of Kherson network providers (listed along the y-axis) through Russian upstream networks was fairly widespread, and for some networks, has continued into 2023. During the analysis time frame, there were three primary Russian networks that appeared as upstream providers: <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as201776\">AS201776 (Miranda-Media)</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as52091\">AS52091 (Level-MSK Ltd.)</a>, and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as8492\">AS8492 (OBIT Ltd.)</a>.</p><p>Within the graph, black bars indicate periods when the ASN effectively disappeared from the Internet; white segments indicate the ASN was dependent on other Ukraine networks as immediate upstreams; and red indicates the presence of Russian networks in the set of upstream providers. The intensity of the red shading corresponds to the percentage of announced prefixes for which a Russian network provider is present in the routing path as observed from networks outside Ukraine. Bright red shading, equivalent to “1” in the legend, indicates the presence of a Russian provider in all routing paths for announced prefixes.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7k9m2YU1xgahnheA5nXR9V/a91fc75c3645029d740d5553aab596ac/Untitled--12-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"667\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In the blog post linked above, we referenced an outage that began on April 30. This is clearly visible in the figure as a black bar that runs for several days across all the listed ASNs. In this instance, AS47598 (KhersonTelecom) recovered a day later, but was sending traffic through AS201776 (Miranda-Media), a Russian provider, as discussed above.</p><p>Another Ukrainian network, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as49168\">AS49168 (Brok-X)</a>, recovered from the outage on May 2, and was also sending traffic through Miranda-Media. By May 4, most of the other Kherson networks recovered from the outage, and both AS47598 and AS49168 returned to using Ukrainian networks as immediate upstream providers. Routing remained “normal” until May 30. Then, a more widespread shift to routing traffic through Russian providers began, although it appears that this shift was preceded by a brief outage for a few networks. For the most part, this re-routing lasted through the summer and into October. Some networks saw a brief outage on October 17, but most stopped routing directly through Russia by October 22.</p><p>However, this shift away from Russia was followed by periods of extended outages. KhersonTelecom suffered such an outage, and has remained offline since October, except for the first week of November when all of its traffic routed through Russia. Many other networks rejoined the Internet in early December, relying mostly on other Ukrainian providers for Internet connectivity. However, since early December, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as204485\">AS204485 (PE Berislav Cable Television)</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as56359\">AS56359 (CHP Melnikov Roman Sergeevich)</a>, and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as49465\">AS49465 (Teleradiocompany RubinTelecom Ltd.)</a> have continued to use Miranda-Media as an upstream provider, in addition to experiencing several brief outages. In addition, over the last several months, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as25082\">AS25082 (Viner Telecom)</a> has used both a Ukrainian network and Miranda-Media as upstream providers.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"internet-resilience-in-ukraine\">Internet resilience in Ukraine</h2>\n      <a href=\"#internet-resilience-in-ukraine\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In the context of the Internet, “<a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/network_resilience\">resilience</a>” refers to the ability of a network to operate continuously in a manner that is highly resistant to disruption. This includes the ability of a network to: (1) operate in a degraded mode if damaged, (2) rapidly recover if failure does occur, and (3) scale to meet rapid or unpredictable demands. Throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict, media coverage (<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjbapv/diy-volunteers-are-repairing-ukraines-destroyed-internet-infrastructure\">VICE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-17/ukraine-stays-online-during-war-thanks-to-repair-crews#xj4y7vzkg\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/29/ukraine-internet-faq/\">Washington Post</a>) has highlighted the work done in Ukraine to repair damaged fiber-optic cables and mobile network infrastructure to keep the country online. This work has been critically important to maintaining the resilience of Ukrainian Internet infrastructure.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.peeringdb.com/advanced_search?country__in=UA&reftag=ix\">PeeringDB</a>, as of February 2023, there are 25 Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) in Ukraine and 50 interconnection facilities. (An IXP may span multiple physical facilities.) Within this set of IXPs, Autonomous Systems (ASes) belonging to international providers are currently present in over half of them. The number of facilities, IXPs, and international ASes present in Ukraine points to a resilient interconnection fabric, with multiple locations for both domestic and international providers to exchange traffic.</p><p>To better understand these international interconnections, we first analyze the connectivity of ASes in Ukraine, and we classify the links to domestic networks (links where both ASes are registered in Ukraine) and international networks (links between ASes in Ukraine and ASes outside Ukraine). To determine which ASes are domestic in Ukraine, we can use information from the extended delegation reports from the <a href=\"https://ftp.ripe.net/pub/stats/ripencc/2023/\">Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC)</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nro.net/about/rirs/\">Regional Internet Registry</a> that covers Ukraine. We also parsed collected BGP data to extract the AS-level links between Ukrainian ASes and ASes registered in a different country, and we consider these the international connectivity of the domestic ASes.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/03/26/the-degrading-treatment-of-ukraines-internet\">March 2022 article in The Economist</a> noted that <i>“For one thing, Ukraine boasts an unusually large number of internet-service providers—by one reckoning the country has the world’s fourth-least-concentrated Internet market. This means the network has few choke points, so is hard to disable.”</i> As of the writing of this blog post, there are 2,190 ASes registered in Ukraine (UA ASes), and 1,574 of those ASes appear in the BGP routing table as active. These counts support the article’s characterization, and below we discuss several additional observations that reinforce Ukraine’s Internet resilience.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7qohQNRwMLbdA96Gb9uhXv/534c703a02c0076b1ad2c263fc06299b/Untitled--13-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"593\" height=\"307\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The figure above is a cumulative distribution function showing the fraction of domestic Ukrainian ASes that have direct connections to international networks. In February 2023, approximately 50% had more than one (100) international link, while approximately 10% had more than 10, and approximately 2% had 100 or more. Although these numbers have dropped slightly over the last year, they underscore the lack of centralized choke points in the Ukrainian Internet.</p><p>For the networks with international connectivity, we can also look at the distribution of “next-hop” countries – countries with which those international networks are associated. (Note that some networks may have a global footprint, and for these, the associated country is the one recorded in their autonomous system registration.) Comparing the choropleth maps below illustrates how this set of countries, and their fraction of international paths, have changed between February 2022 and February 2023. The data underlying these maps shows that international connectivity from Ukraine is distributed across 18 countries — unsurprisingly, mostly in Europe.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/68XPvDkbwMtRjqfJ7dpeJd/9f5ab638412429518c1324e0234937a3/UA-2022-fraction-of-next-hop-ases-by-country.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"848\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In February 2022, these countries/locations accounted for 77% of Ukraine’s next-hop international paths. The top four all had 7.8% each. However, in February 2023, the top 10 next-hop countries/locations dropped slightly to 76% of international paths. While just a slight change from the previous year, the set of countries/locations and many of their respective fractions saw considerable change.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><style
