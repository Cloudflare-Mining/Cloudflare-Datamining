Without a second factor, any mishap involving your password can lead to a compromise. Journalist Mat Honan’s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\">high profile compromise</a> in 2012 is a great example of the importance of two-factor authentication. When he later <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\">wrote about the incident</a> he said, &quot;Had I used two-factor authentication for my Google account, it’s possible that none of this would have happened.&quot;</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisatotpapp\">What is a TOTP app?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238\">TOTP (Time-based One Time Password)</a> is the mechanism that Google Authenticator, Authy and other two-factor authentication apps use to generate short-lived authentication codes. <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/choosing-a-two-factor-authentication-system\">We’ve written previously on the blog</a> about how TOTP works.</p>\n<p>We didn’t want to limit you to only using two-factor providers that we'd built integrations with, so we built an open TOTP integration in the Cloudflare dashboard, allowing you to set up two-factor with any app that implements TOTP. That means you can choose from a wide array of apps for logging into Cloudflare securely with two-factor such as <a href=\"https://m.vip.symantec.com/home.v\">Symantec</a>, <a href=\"https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile\">Duo Mobile</a> and <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/guides/ios/?q=totp\">1Password</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-15-at-3.59.18-PM_5.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"getstarted\">Get Started</h3>\n<p>If you want to enable Two-Factor Authentication with Google Authenticator or any other TOTP provider, visit <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com/a/account/my-account\">your account settings here</a>. It’s easy to set up and the best way to secure your account. We also have step by step instructions for you <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167866\">in our knowledge base</a>.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
