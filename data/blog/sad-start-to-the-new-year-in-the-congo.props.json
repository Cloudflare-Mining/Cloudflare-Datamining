		"html": "<p>The calendar has barely flipped to 2019 and already we’re seeing Internet disruptions.</p><p>Today, Cloudflare can quantitatively confirm that Internet access has been shut down in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, information already reported by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/02/africa/congo-internet-shutdown-china-intl/index.html\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-46721168\">press</a> <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20190101-western-powers-urge-dr-congo-restore-internet-access\">organisations</a>. This shutdown occurred as the presidential election was taking place on December the 30th, and continues as the results are published.</p><p>Sadly, this act is far from unprecedented. We have published many posts about events like this in the past, including a different post about roughly three days of <a href=\"/large-drop-in-traffic-from-the-democratic-republic-of-congo/\">Internet disruption</a> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo less than a year ago. A painfully familiar shape can be seen on our network monitoring platform, showing that the traffic in the country is barely reaching a quarter of its typical level:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3ROF5FinXvyDAEQ0CCTrUc/5d608c6314bbc0cab32ec43cce860ff4/Typical-Level.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"473\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Note that the graph is based on UTC and Democratic Republic of the Congo’s capital Kinshasa has the timezone of GMT+1.</p><p>The drop in bandwidth started just before midday on 31 December 2018 (around 10:30 UTC, 11:30 local time in Kinshasa). This can be clearly seen if we overlay each 24 hour day over each other:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5V9UIffoCO9JV0X4SEIXjR/365d59c11333a0c2c41bbf4a428bf6a3/Day-over-Day-Comparison-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"475\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The red line is 31 December, the gray lines the previous eight days. Looking at today’s overlay bandwidth graph, we can confirm this has continued and is an abnormal behaviour.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1vAgqhbZ75w6isa2OnOaHE/8c2da6b8d0158f51110eb473416ed654/Day-over-Day-Comparison-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"471\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Other actors on the Internet have also been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InternetIntel/status/1080465195024158720\">reporting similar figures</a>. We hope that we can soon inform our readers the country is normally connected to the Internet again.</p><p>While 85 million people live in the country, very few people have internet access (6.21% according to Wikipedia’s List of countries by number of Internet users <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users\">page</a>). The country is also very large (2,344,858 square kms or 905,355 sq miles) and the 11th largest country in the world - around a quarter the landmass of the USA and nearly twice as big as South Africa. These facts play together and because of limited fiber deployment within the country; there are many places that still use very limited and expensive satellite Internet access. We can see in our bandwidth kgraphs that traffic to these satellite connected locations was not affected by this shutdown:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1f6bAOHtQemHykbRToyiSR/2a15a12baa54ed1f34c152406662c690/Bandwidth-Levels.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"347\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Note that the bandwidth levels are very low and represent a very small percentage of the overall traffic into Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p><p>Comparing that graph to the one from the largest mobile provider in the country; we clearly see the distinct cutoff.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6eOOOybv6MBPfdeavWoEni/ca929b7122c2427e24eec87cbd75b70c/Distinct-Cutoff.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"349\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"repeated-across-the-world\">Repeated across the world</h3>\n            <a href=\"#repeated-across-the-world\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>15 months ago we wrote about an outage in <a href=\"/the-story-of-two-outages/\">Togo</a>, were we noted that this adds Togo to the list of countries like <a href=\"/syrian-internet-access-appears-partially-rees/\">Syria</a> (twice), Iraq, Turkey, Libya, Tunisia, etc that have restricted or revoked Internet access.

In Gambia’s case, the incumbent president lost the election! In fact we wrote “<i>Rather than clamping down on the opposition by blocking the access to the Internet, it is quite possible that the blackout in Gambia may have infuriated voters and increased the vote against the president.</i>”. Let’s see what happens in Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p><p>We&#39;ll update this blog once we see changes to these traffic levels.
