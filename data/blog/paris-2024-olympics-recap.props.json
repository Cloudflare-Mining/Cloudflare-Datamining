With 329 events across 32 sports, over 10,000 athletes from 204 nations participated in the pursuit of medals and glory, creating some viral online moments along the way. In this post, we turn our attention to the closing ceremony, the impact of various Olympic moments on Internet traffic, and the cyber attacks faced by sponsors. We also examine email trends related to the Olympics, including mentions of Simone Biles, Snoop Dogg, and Imane Khelif.</p><p>Cloudflare has a global presence with data centers in over 330 cities, supporting millions of customers with different tools and products, which provides a global view of what’s happening on the Internet. This is helpful for improving security, privacy, efficiency, and speed, but also for observing Internet disruptions and traffic trends.</p><p>In our previous <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/paris-2024-summer-olympics-impacted-internet-traffic\"><u>blog post about the opening ceremony</u></a> and the early days of the event, we showed how France was impacted by the Olympics, with clear drops in traffic during the main events. The opening ceremony caused the most significant drop—traffic decreased by as much as 20% compared to the previous week. Other countries were also less online during that time, spending more time on broadcast TV.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"closing-ceremony-impact-in-france\">Closing ceremony impact in France</h2>\n      <a href=\"#closing-ceremony-impact-in-france\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2WMTcMXB7ekSuPAqUiFn6X/993532e5913227e9f31070b9211da047/2501-2.jpg\" alt=\"2501-2\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sub><i>The moment that the Golden Voyager (a golden dancing character) descended from the sky during the closing ceremony.

Our data shows noticeable drops in Internet activity during key Olympic events, particularly in France, as viewers shifted from online activities to watching the games live. This trend underscores the enduring power of broadcast media during major global events, even in an increasingly digital age.</p><p>Additionally, the increase in DNS traffic for official Olympic websites and the surge in DNS traffic for streaming platforms covering the event indicates strong interest in online coverage, especially among certain audiences, complementing traditional TV viewership broadcast by national networks worldwide. </p><p>Finally, the heightened cybersecurity threats, including DDoS attacks on sponsor sites and the rise in Olympic-related emails (including spam and malicious ones), emphasize both the marketing impact of this global event and its vulnerabilities.</p><p>And after the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Paralympics\"><u>2024 Summer Paralympics</u></a> are just around the corner (August 28-September 8), and in four years, it will be time for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2028_Summer_Olympics\"><u>LA 2028</u></a>.</p><p>As we’ve observed throughout the Paris 2024 Olympics, the Olympic spirit continues to capture interest and remains relevant across different media. This spirit, present for 2,800 years since Ancient Greece (dating back to 776 BC), still attracts and inspires humanity. </p><p><i>(Jorge Pacheco from the </i><a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\"><i><u>Cloudflare Radar</u></i></a><i> team contributed to this blog post)</i></p>",
