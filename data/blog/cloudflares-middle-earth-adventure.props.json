This summer, we crossed more than 100,000 websites using CloudFlare so we decided to head out on another team retreat to what may literally be the opposite of Vegas: a caving expedition in the foothills of the Sierra mountains.</p><p>The team (now 20) loaded in a bus to head to Murphys, CA on Thursday. I had suggested we watch &quot;The Descent&quot; on the ride up. Somehow Michelle was convinced it was an inspirational film about people surviving getting stuck in a cave. For those of you who haven&#39;t seen it, it&#39;s <a href=\"http://celebritywonder.ugo.com/mp/2006_The_Descent/movieposter.jpg\">not exactly that</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5pqE7amBDx2pKC6k1QpluJ/afd5f600caeb07fe4c6d2073b8473bde/bus_to_caves.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We had a great dinner at <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/angelos-steakhouse-italiano-murphys\">Angelo&#39;s Steakhouse Italiano</a> which was very good and the staff was a lot of fun. Sri only had to leave once during dinner to fend off a DDoS attack.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/Yk4q9Et24DzvnrnkxKz8l/5ce985bf648d9fb8e782306257b9cdce/dinner_in_murphys.JPG.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"373\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The night ended with karaoke at a local in Murphys where we learned that we are much better at making the web faster and safer than we are at singing or playing pool.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5jEURq5Kr5Ux0bCkeKgHtZ/1619722e50b27e74b62ef97b0022848f/kareoke_in_murphys.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"373\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The next morning the team loaded back in the bus to head to the Moaning Caverns. If you&#39;ve ever been on a cave tour where you walk along a well lit path with railings safe for school groups, this wasn&#39;t that. Instead, it started with getting suited up for a rappel down nearly 200 feet into the cave.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/41dKQDg9Bl6J8ZF5SMK11U/2635ce8db8f0147036e838e8fcbd93f0/preparing_to_rappel.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The guide&#39;s advice that you &quot;never let go of the rope&quot; was punctuated by the large pile of at least 30,000 years worth of fossilized bones piled directly below the hole we were rappelling into.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6UuwnbVdsgSS8T5SvL0xSC/bb5253891c11e84c0764101040a3de20/the_hole.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Chris here is hanging about 160 feet above the cave floor in a cavern large enough that it could hold the Statue of Liberty.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3XWnAbbBeaa06M6acY3dBP/e1898112fbe475ac71a961dfea97a667/chris_rappelling.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth\nAdventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Matthieu&#39;s rock climbing experience made him a natural.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2pCmLneEQ6jOtGq9BcusFP/2dbf67ff9856c098af8636b7dbabd9e6/matthieu_rappelling.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"341\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We don&#39;t have any pictures of what happened next because the guides advised us if we brought cameras in they would likely get crushed, smashed, scratched or broken. That wasn&#39;t exaggeration. Over the next several hours we made our way through chambers and tight passages like the Roach Motel, the Meat Grinder, the Guillotine, and the Birth Canal. To give you a sense, this is a photo from the cave&#39;s website showing someone emerging from the Meat Grinder.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3hzVoQ2I0F1oQrPNmfdpdc/3c0e21d2d15842a0459a9f5004555cef/meat_grinder.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When I first saw the photo I thought it couldn&#39;t really be like that. I was wrong, it is exactly like that. We squeezed through holes I wouldn&#39;t have thought I could ever fit through. I&#39;m a little clausterphobic, so it was a mental challenge for me. Having colleagues I trust from Team CloudFlare on the journey helped in those times I wasn&#39;t sure I could do it. It was very intense and unlike anything I&#39;ve ever done before.</p><p>At several points along the journey you could exit if you weren&#39;t feeling up for the next challenge (I made it to Godzilla&#39;s Nostril). Six of the team made it all the way to the end, 45 feet straight up the Chimney and then down the appropriately named Wedgie Hill.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/67wLIUxnFsxttz2yWXIzMK/4a681fae6eedbdd550d5f1cad109fd93/michelle_on_wedgie_hill.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"478\" height=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Muddy? Yes. Bruised? A little. Shellshocked? Probably still the next day.
