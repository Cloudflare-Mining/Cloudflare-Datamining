This summer, we crossed more than 100,000 websites using CloudFlare so we decided to head out on another team retreat to what may literally be the opposite of Vegas: a caving expedition in the foothills of the Sierra mountains.</p><p>The team (now 20) loaded in a bus to head to Murphys, CA on Thursday. I had suggested we watch &quot;The Descent&quot; on the ride up. Somehow Michelle was convinced it was an inspirational film about people surviving getting stuck in a cave.

If you&#39;ve ever been on a cave tour where you walk along a well lit path with railings safe for school groups, this wasn&#39;t that. Instead, it started with getting suited up for a rappel down nearly 200 feet into the cave.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/41dKQDg9Bl6J8ZF5SMK11U/f1131c620aabc2fd3dd84a7bd40ef42c/preparing_to_rappel.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The guide&#39;s advice that you &quot;never let go of the rope&quot; was punctuated by the large pile of at least 30,000 years worth of fossilized bones piled directly below the hole we were rappelling into.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6UuwnbVdsgSS8T5SvL0xSC/6509313c37e3d8230ee40ab5ee641e97/the_hole.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Chris here is hanging about 160 feet above the cave floor in a cavern large enough that it could hold the Statue of Liberty.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3XWnAbbBeaa06M6acY3dBP/c627ba617f10bad0460ae1f1ffcff096/chris_rappelling.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth\nAdventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Matthieu&#39;s rock climbing experience made him a natural.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2pCmLneEQ6jOtGq9BcusFP/7d17e71a85fb352bbe7d629bfcaf70ad/matthieu_rappelling.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"341\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We don&#39;t have any pictures of what happened next because the guides advised us if we brought cameras in they would likely get crushed, smashed, scratched or broken. That wasn&#39;t exaggeration. Over the next several hours we made our way through chambers and tight passages like the Roach Motel, the Meat Grinder, the Guillotine, and the Birth Canal. To give you a sense, this is a photo from the cave&#39;s website showing someone emerging from the Meat Grinder.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3hzVoQ2I0F1oQrPNmfdpdc/c05ce8e9fd0ed23e37fac09322e0b2f0/meat_grinder.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When I first saw the photo I thought it couldn&#39;t really be like that. I was wrong, it is exactly like that. We squeezed through holes I wouldn&#39;t have thought I could ever fit through. I&#39;m a little clausterphobic, so it was a mental challenge for me. Having colleagues I trust from Team CloudFlare on the journey helped in those times I wasn&#39;t sure I could do it. It was very intense and unlike anything I&#39;ve ever done before.</p><p>At several points along the journey you could exit if you weren&#39;t feeling up for the next challenge (I made it to Godzilla&#39;s Nostril). Six of the team made it all the way to the end, 45 feet straight up the Chimney and then down the appropriately named Wedgie Hill.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/67wLIUxnFsxttz2yWXIzMK/05e550a35a32c5044faf1a9c030b6fca/michelle_on_wedgie_hill.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare's Middle Earth Adventure\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"478\" height=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Muddy?
