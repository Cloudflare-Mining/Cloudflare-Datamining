Over the years, use of the Internet has evolved from email and static sites to social media, streaming, e-commerce, cloud tools, and more recently AI chatbots, reflecting its constant adaptation to users&#39; needs.

We aggregate domains for each service (e.g., twitter.com, t.co, and x.com for X) and identify the sites that provide services to humans, thus excluding technical domains like root-servers.net. Rankings reflect relative popularity within categories, not absolute traffic. Therefore, a drop in rank doesn’t always indicate less traffic to a specific Internet service — it may simply reflect increased competition from other services, leading to a change in rank.</p><p><a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024?#internet-services\"><u>This part</u></a> of the 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review highlights shifts in Internet services, with rising platforms like Temu, GitHub Copilot, and WeChat reflecting changing user preferences. ChatGPT (OpenAI) also played a more prominent role in the generative AI space and in our Overall ranking, nearly reaching the Top 50. Major events like the Paris Olympics and US elections influenced rankings as well, boosting Olympics-related sites and news platforms like CNN and Fox News.</p><p>This year, we’re also including a by-country/region perspective on the most popular Internet services for the first time, showing the Top 10 Overall for 132 countries/regions. At the bottom of this post, we highlight trends found in this localized data, including how ChatGPT performed best in Singapore.</p><p>Keep reading for a detailed look at the evolution of trends throughout the year.

Our 2024 rankings highlight the enduring dominance of platforms like Google, Facebook, and TikTok, alongside the rapid rise of generative AI services like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, with new players like GitHub Copilot and Claude making strides.</p><p>In social media, X shows declining influence, while Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon are carving out niches but remain far from overtaking established platforms. Temu continues to rise in e-commerce, while Shein and AliExpress strengthened their global positions. In cryptocurrency, Binance regained momentum as Bitcoin surged, and newer players entered the scene. Gaming saw Roblox maintain its lead, with Steam experiencing notable growth.</p><p>Events like the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, US elections, and war-related attacks also shaped Internet trends, emphasizing how global events influence online activity. These trends mirror real-world developments and set the stage for an interconnected, tech-driven future.</p><p>On a final note, creating rankings is a team effort that comes with its own challenges and requires careful attention and frequent updates. We welcome your <a href=\"mailto:radar@cloudflare.com\"><u>feedback</u></a> and suggestions for new categories to explore in the Year in Review.</p><p><i>(Our data scientist, Sabina Zejnilovic, played a crucial role in gathering the Internet services data.)</i></p>",
