A WebSocket connection is bidirectional: the server can send data to the browser without the browser having to explicitly ask for it. This makes things like multiplayer games, chat, and other services that require real-time exchange of information possible over a standard web protocol</i></p><p>There&#39;s a lot more technical history in <a href=\"/cloudflare-now-supports-websockets/\">that post</a> covering how we modified NGINX to support a huge number of connections through port reuse. But the bottom line is that WebSockets are a vital technology for web sites that need to get real-time updates for features like social feeds, multimedia chat, collaborative editing, multi-player gaming, stock updates, and more.</p><h3>Performance &amp; Latency</h3><p>Because the WebSocket protocol creates a single connection and doesn’t require HTTP requests, WebSockets can provide anywhere from 500:1 to a 1000:1 reduction in unnecessary HTTP header traffic, compared to HTTP polling solutions.</p><p>The server no longer needs to wait for a request to come back before it sends new data; it can simply push the data to the client the moment it has new information. Tests have shown a 3:1 reduction in latency compared to other polling solutions.</p><p>   </p><h3>Modern Internet, for More People</h3><p>Last week, we expanded our deep support for <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/http2\">HTTP/2</a> to include <a href=\"/announcing-support-for-http-2-server-push-2/\">Server Push</a>. HTTP/2 was finalized as a spec in 2015, so almost a newborn child as technologies go. (We&#39;re excited to help HTTP/2 grow up fast.)</p><p>By comparison, WebSockets is already a toddler, as RFC 6455 was finalized in 2011.</p><p>But, perhaps because of complexity or expense, WebSockets hasn&#39;t seen as wide adoption as we&#39;d expect. CloudFlare is removing those obstacles, and frankly we&#39;re curious to see what happens.</p><p>We are building a better Internet, and while that may sound like a platitude... making modern tech easy to use matters. We&#39;re eager to see what our customers do to play, grow, and thrive with another tool available.</p><p>Read more about <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/websockets/\">WebSockets</a> generally, or review details in our <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169466-Can-I-use-CloudFlare-with-WebSockets-\">support article</a>.</p>",
