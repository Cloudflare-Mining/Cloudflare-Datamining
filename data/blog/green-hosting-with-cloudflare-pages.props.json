Every provider should be at least this transparent when it comes to accounting for the environmental impact of their services. We see a growing number of users relying on CDNs to host their sites, and they are often confused when their sites no longer show as green, because they’re not using a green CDN. It’s good to see another more sustainable option available to users, and one that is independently verified.” - </i><b><i>Chris Adams</i></b><i>, Co-director of The Green Web Foundation</i></p></blockquote>",
