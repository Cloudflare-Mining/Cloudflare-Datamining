Bandwidth is the largest recurring cost of providing our service. Compared with Europe and North America, there were considerably higher Internet costs in Australia, Asia and Latin America. Even while bandwidth costs tend to <a href=\"https://www.telegeography.com/press/press-releases/2015/09/09/ip-transit-prices-continue-falling-major-discrepancies-remain/index.html\">trend down over time</a>, driven by competition and decreases in the costs of underlying hardware, we thought it might be interesting to provide an update.</p><p>Since August 2014, we have tripled the number of our data centers from 28 to 86, with more to come. CloudFlare hardware is also deployed in new regions such as the Middle East and Africa. Our network spans multiple countries in each continent, and, sometimes, multiple cities in each country.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/72mogBmAnpUvL0sWav4zfu/75df55abaa527068469274c503b719bf/Traffic_86_PoPs-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1055\" height=\"131\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Traffic across 86 data centers in the CloudFlare network</i></p><p>There are approximately thirteen networks called “Tier 1 networks” (e.g., Telia, GTT, Tata, Cogent) who sell “transit” to access any of thousands of other networks on the Internet using their global backbones, including networks who are not their customers. We connect to networks by either purchasing transit from a global <a href=\"http://research.dyn.com/2016/04/a-bakers-dozen-2015-edition/\">&quot;Tier 1 network&quot;</a> (or major regional network), or by exchanging traffic directly with a carrier or ISP using “peering”. Typically, peered traffic is exchanged without settlement between the peered parties.</p><p>We try to make it as easy as possible for networks to interconnect with us. CloudFlare has an “open peering” policy, and participates at nearly <a href=\"http://bgp.he.net/report/exchanges#_participants\">150 internet exchanges</a>, more than any other company.</p><p>As a benchmark, <b>let&#39;s assume the cost of transit in Europe and North America is 10 units</b> (per Mbps).

This is contrary to the model in most parts of the world, where networks self-regulate, and often peer without settlement.

We peer about 60% of traffic in South America, making for an effective cost of 68 units.</p><p>One of the reasons that transit prices are high is that the Tier 1 networks which are newer entrants to this region have yet to pick up significant market share. While markets such as Brazil are less expensive and have greater peering, costs are highest in countries such as Peru and Argentina where, in each, a single incumbent provider, respectively Telefonica and Telecom Argentina, controls access for the last mile delivery of content to the majority of Internet users.</p><p>As we try to increase our share of peered traffic, one of the challenges we face is that many Internet exchanges (e.g., NAP Colombia) only permit domestically incorporated and licensed networks to publicly peer, or in another case, require a unanimous vote of all members on an IX to permit a new participant, effectively creating a separation between “international content” and “domestic content”.</p><p>If you include Telecom Argentina and Telefonica, our blended cost of bandwidth in South America is 68 units.

If you are a free customer using an excessive amount of expensive transit, we would serve you from fewer regions. The good news is that, over the last five years, we’ve been able to negotiate reasonable transit pricing or settlement-free peering with the vast majority of the world’s networks. That allows us to continue to provide the free version of our service as well as to keep prices low for all our paid services.</p><p>Today, however, there are <b>six expensive networks (HiNet, Korea Telecom, Optus, Telecom Argentina, Telefonica, Telstra</b>) that are more than an order of magnitude more expensive than other bandwidth providers around the globe and refuse to discuss local peering relationships. To give you a sense, these six networks represent less than 6% of the traffic but nearly 50% of our bandwidth costs.</p><p>While we’ve tried to engage all these providers to reduce their extremely high costs and ensure that even our Free customers can be served across their networks, we’ve hit an impasse. To that end, unfortunately, we’ve made the decision that the only thing that will change these providers’ pricing is to make it clear how out of step they are with the rest of the world. To demonstrate this, we’ve moved our Free customers off these six transit providers. Free customers will still be accessible across our network and served from another regional cache with more reasonable bandwidth pricing.</p><p>Ironically, this actually increases the cost to several of these providers because they now need to backhaul traffic to another CloudFlare data center and pay more in the process. For instance, if Telstra were to peer with CloudFlare then they would only have to move traffic over about 30 meters of fiber optic cable between our adjoining cages in the same data center. Now Telstra will need to backhaul traffic to Free customers to Los Angeles or Singapore over expensive undersea cables. Their behavior is irrational in any competitive market and so it is not a surprise that each of these providers is a relative monopolist in their home market.</p><p>If you’re a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/\">Free CloudFlare</a> customer who cares about optimizing the best possible performance from one of these six providers then we encourage you to reach out to them and encourage them to follow a core principle of a free and open Internet and not abuse their monopoly position. We are committed to serving all our customers across every network that peers with us. To that end, help us convince these six networks to be on the right side of a free and open Internet by reaching out to your ISP.</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"http://service.hinet.net/2004/ncsc/index.htm\">Ask HiNet to peer with CloudFlare in Taipei</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"http://www.kt.com/eng/etc/contact.jsp\">Ask Korea Telecom to peer with CloudFlare in Seoul</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"http://www.optus.com.au/shop/support/answer/complaints-compliments?requestType=NormalRequest&id=1409&typeId=5\">Ask Optus to peer with CloudFlare across Australia</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"http://www.telecom.com.ar/hogares/gestion_libro.htm\">Ask Telecom Argentina to peer with CloudFlare in Buenos Aires</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/press-office/contact-us\">Ask Telefonica to peer with CloudFlare across South America</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://say.telstra.com.au/customer/general/forms/Email-Complaint\">Ask Telstra to peer with CloudFlare across Australia</a></p></li></ul><p>We’ll post updates as we negotiate with these six networks and are hopeful that we’ll soon be able to serve all our customers across all the networks we interconnect with.</p>",
