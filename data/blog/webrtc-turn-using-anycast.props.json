(Think of port numbers on an IP address as extensions behind a single phone number.) To solve this problem of IP scarcity, network engineers developed a way to share a single IP address across multiple devices by exploiting the port numbers. This is called Network Address Translation (NAT) and it is a process through which your router knows which packets to send to your smartphone versus your laptop or other devices, all of which are connecting to the public Internet through the IP address assigned to the router.</p><p>In a typical NAT setup, when a device sends a packet to the Internet, the NAT assigns a random, unused port to track it, keeping a forwarding table to map the device to the port. This allows NAT to direct responses back to the correct device, even if the source IP address and port vary across different destinations. The system works as long as the internal device initiates the connection and waits for the response.</p><p>However, real-time apps like video or audio calls are more challenging with NAT. Since NATs don&#39;t reveal how they assign ports, devices can&#39;t pre-communicate where to send responses, making it difficult to establish reliable connections. Earlier solutions like STUN (<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3489\"><u>RFC 3489</u></a>) couldn&#39;t fully solve this, which gave rise to the TURN protocol.</p><p>TURN predictably relays traffic between devices while ensuring minimal delay, which is crucial for real-time communication where even a second of lag can disrupt the experience.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"ice-to-determine-if-a-relay-server-is-needed\">ICE to determine if a relay server is needed</h3>\n      <a href=\"#ice-to-determine-if-a-relay-server-is-needed\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8445\"><u>ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) protocol</u></a> was designed to find the fastest communication path between devices.

By naturally distributing load across multiple servers based on network topology, this setup helps balance traffic and improve performance. When you use Cloudflare’s TURN service, you don’t need to manage a list of servers for different parts of the world. And you don’t need to write custom scaling logic to scale VMs up or down based on your traffic.  </p><p>Anycast allows TURN to use fewer IP addresses, making it easier to allowlist in restrictive networks. Stateless protocols like DNS over UDP work well with anycast. This includes stateless STUN binding requests used to determine a system&#39;s external IP address behind a NAT.</p><p>However, stateful protocols over UDP, like QUIC or TURN, are more challenging with anycast. QUIC handles this better due to its stable connection ID, which load balancers can use to consistently route traffic. However, TURN/STUN lacks a similar connection ID. So when a TURN client sends requests to the Cloudflare TURN service, the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/\"><u>Unimog load balancer</u></a> ensures that all its requests get routed to the same server within a data center. The challenges for the communication between a client on the Internet and Cloudflare services listening on an anycast IP address have been described <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/loadbalancing/\"><u>multiple times before</u></a>.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-does-cloudflares-turn-server-receive-packets\">How does Cloudflare&#39;s TURN server receive packets?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-does-cloudflares-turn-server-receive-packets\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>TURN servers act as relay points to help connect clients. This process involves two types of connections: the client-server connection and the third-party connection (relayed address).</p><p>The client-server connection uses <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/calls/turn/#_top\"><u>published</u></a> IP and port information to communicate with TURN clients using anycast.</p><p>For the relayed address, using anycast poses a challenge. The TURN protocol requires that packets reach the specific Cloudflare server handling the client connection. If we used anycast for relay addresses, packets might not arrive at the correct data center or server.\n</p><p>One alternative is to use unicast addresses for relay candidates. However, this approach has drawbacks, including making servers vulnerable to attacks and requiring many IP addresses.</p><p>\n</p><p>To solve these issues, we&#39;ve developed a middle-ground solution, previously discussed in “<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-servers-dont-own-ips-anymore/\"><u>Cloudflare servers don&#39;t own IPs anymore – so how do they connect to the Internet?</u></a>”. We use anycast addresses but add extra handling for packets that reach incorrect servers. If a packet arrives at the wrong Cloudflare location, we forward it over our backbone to the correct datacenter, rather than sending it back over the public Internet.</p><p>This approach not only resolves routing issues but also improves TURN connection speed. Packets meant for the relay address enter the Cloudflare network as close to the sender as possible, optimizing the routing process.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2JxesKGit6hdK0NzaEduEk/5b248cbc27293b9dc1ccb1a5b5f7b615/image1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1014\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><sup><i>In this non-ideal setup, a TURN client connects to Cloudflare using Anycast, while a direct client uses Unicast, which would expose the TURN server to potential DDoS attacks.</i></sup></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/CI9Q5qMDC7xXcifH5l898/975e7f52416e0b737c250433aa68ee82/image2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1015\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><sup><i>The optimized setup uses Anycast for all TURN clients, allowing for dynamic load distribution across Cloudflare&#39;s globally distributed TURN servers.</i></sup></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"try-cloudflare-calls-turn-today\">Try Cloudflare Calls TURN today</h2>\n      <a href=\"#try-cloudflare-calls-turn-today\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The new TURN feature of Cloudflare Calls addresses critical challenges in real-time communication:</p><ul><li><p><b>Connectivity</b>: By solving NAT traversal issues, TURN ensures reliable connections even in complex network environments.</p></li><li><p><b>Privacy</b>: Acting as an intermediary, TURN enhances user privacy by masking IP addresses and network details.</p></li><li><p><b>Performance</b>: Leveraging Cloudflare&#39;s global anycast network, our TURN service offers unparalleled speed and near-zero latency.</p></li><li><p><b>Scalability</b>: With presence in over 330 cities, Cloudflare Calls TURN grows with your needs.</p></li></ul><p>Cloudflare Calls TURN service is billed on a usage basis.
