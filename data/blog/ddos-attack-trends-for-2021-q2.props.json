Earlier this quarter, more than 200 organizations across Belgium, including the government and parliament websites and other services, were <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/05/05/belgium-government-websites-offline-ddos-attack/\">also DDoS’d</a>.</p><p>And when most of the United States were celebrating Independence Day on July 4, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/technology/cyberattack-businesses-ransom.html\">hundreds of US companies</a> were hit by a ransomware attack demanding 70 million USD in Bitcoin. Attackers known to be affiliated with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REvil\">REvil</a>, a Russian ransomware group, exploited multiple previously unknown <a href=\"https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/03/Kaseya-Case-Update/\">vulnerabilities in IT management software</a>. The targets included schools, small public-sector bodies, travel and leisure organizations, and credit unions, to name a few. While the threat of ransomware and ransom DDoS is not new (read our posts on <a href=\"/targeted-ransomware-attack/\">ransomware</a> and <a href=\"/ransom-ddos-attacks-target-a-fortune-global-500-company/\">ransom DDoS</a> from 2021 Q1), the latest attacks on Internet properties ranging from wineries, professional sports teams, ferry services and hospitals has brought them from just being background noise to front page headlines affecting our day-to-day lives. In fact, recent attacks have propelled ransomware and DDoS to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/world/europe/biden-putin-cyberweapons.html\">top of US President Biden’s national security agenda</a>.</p><p>The DDoS attack trends observed over Cloudflare’s network in 2021 Q2 paint a picture that reflects the overall global cyber threat landscape. Here are some highlights.</p><ul><li><p>Over 11% of our surveyed customers who were targeted by a DDoS attack reported receiving a threat or ransom letter threatening in advance, in the first six months of this year. Emergency onboarding of customers under an active DDoS attack increased by 41.8% in 2021 H1 compared to 2020 H2.</p></li><li><p>HTTP DDoS attacks targeting government administration/public sector websites increased by 491%, making it the second most targeted industry after Consumer Services whose DDoS activity increased by 684% QoQ.</p></li><li><p>China remains the country with the most DDoS activity originating from within their borders — 7 out of every 1,000 HTTP requests originating from China were part of an HTTP DDoS attack targeting websites, and more than 3 out of every 100 bytes that were ingested in our data centers in China were part of a network-layer DDoS attack.</p></li><li><p>Emerging threats included amplification DDoS attacks that abused the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QOTD\">Quote of the Day</a> (QOTD) protocol which increased by 123% QoQ. Additionally, as the adoption of QUIC protocol continues to increase, so do <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-quic-flood/\">attacks over QUIC</a> — registering a whopping 109% QoQ surge in 2021 Q2.The number of network-layer DDoS attacks in the range of 10-100 Gbps increased by 21.4% QoQ. One customer that was attacked is <a href=\"https://hypixel.net/\">Hypixel</a>, an American gaming company. Hypixel remained online with no downtime and no performance penalties to their gamer users, even when under an active DDoS attack campaign larger than 620 Gbps.

It’s a DDoS attack that exploits the very foundation of the TCP protocol. A stateful TCP connection between a client and a server begins with a 3-way <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/\">TCP handshake</a>. The client sends an initial connection request packet with a synchronize flag (SYN). The server responds with a packet that contains a synchronized acknowledgment flag (SYN-ACK). Finally, the client responds with an acknowledgment (ACK) packet. At this point, a connection is established and data can be exchanged until the connection is closed. This stateful process can be abused by attackers to cause denial of service events.</p><p>By repeatedly sending SYN packets, the attacker attempts to overwhelm a server or the router’s connection table that tracks the state of TCP connections. The router replies with a SYN-ACK packet, allocates a certain amount of memory for each given connection, and falsely waits for the client to respond with the final ACK. Given a sufficient number of connections occupying the router’s memory, the router is unable to allocate further memory for legitimate clients, causing the router to crash or preventing it from handling legitimate client connections, i.e., a denial of service event.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"emerging-threats\">Emerging threats</h3>\n            <a href=\"#emerging-threats\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Emerging threats included amplification DDoS attacks that abuse the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QOTD\">Quote of the Day</a> (QOTD) service which increased by 123% QoQ.

The demonstration attack is typically over UDP, lasting roughly 30-120 minutes.</p><p>The ransom note is typically sent to the common group email aliases of the company that are publicly available online such as noc@, support@, help@, legal@, abuse@, etc. In several cases, it has ended up in spam. In other cases, we’ve seen employees disregard the ransom note as spam, increasing the organization’s response time which resulted in further damage to their online properties.</p><p>Cloudflare’s recommendation for organizations that receive a threat or ransom note:</p><ol><li><p><b>Do not panic, and we recommend you do not pay the ransom</b>: Paying ransom only encourages and funds bad actors. There’s also no guarantee that you won’t be attacked again anyway.</p></li><li><p><b>Contact local law enforcement</b>: Be ready to provide a copy of the ransom letter you received and any other logs or packet captures.</p></li><li><p><b>Activate an effective DDoS protection strategy</b>: Cloud-based DDoS protection can be quickly onboarded in the event of an active threat, and with a team of security experts on your side, risks can be mitigated quickly and effectively.</p></li></ol><p><a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/ransom-ddos\">Here’s a short video</a> by Cloudflare CTO, John Graham-Cumming addressing the threat of ransom DDoS attacks.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a id=\"Hypixel\"><h2>Cloudflare protects Hypixel against a massive DDoS attack campaign</h2></a><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>At Cloudflare, our teams have been exceptionally busy this past quarter rapidly onboarding (onto our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/\">Magic Transit service</a>) a multitude of new and existing customers that have either received a ransom letter or were under an active DDoS attack.</p><p>One such customer is <a href=\"https://hypixel.net/\">Hypixel Inc</a>, the development studio behind the world&#39;s largest Minecraft minigame server. With over 24M total unique logins to date and a world record 216,000+ concurrent players on PC, the Hypixel team works hard to add value to the experience of millions of players across the globe.</p><p>The gaming industry is often subject to some of the largest volumetric DDoS attacks — and as a marquee brand, Hypixel attracts more than its fair share. Uptime and high performance are fundamental to the functioning of Hypixel’s servers. Any perceived downtime or noticeable lag could result in an exodus of gamers.</p><p>When Hypixel was under a massive DDoS attack campaign, they turned to Cloudflare to extend their services with Cloudflare to include Magic Transit, Cloudflare’s BGP-based DDoS protection service for network infrastructure. After rapidly onboarding them overnight, Cloudflare was automatically able to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks targeting their network — several of which were well over 620 Gbps. The DDoS attack comprised mostly TCP floods and UDP amplification attacks. In the graph, the various colors represent the multiple Cloudflare systems that contribute to detecting and mitigating the multi-vector attack — emphasising the value of our multi-layered DDoS approach.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3OOyezktZS10mCS4iK4YH2/e6b0cac93a92b09e7b2e1737aedc833d/image10-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1888\" height=\"686\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Even as attack patterns changed in real-time, Magic Transit shielded Hypixel’s network. In fact, because all their clean traffic routed over Cloudflare’s high performing low-latency network, Hypixel’s users noticed no change in gamer experience — even during an active volumetric DDoS attack.</p><p>During the attack campaign, Cloudflare automatically detected and mitigated over 5,000 DDoS attacks: 53% were ACK floods, 39% were UDP-based attacks and 8% SYN floods.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7KjFtFo9jD57noYEmgeOGA/06f02cd677a11129603870fe28a0c85d/image4-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><blockquote><p>“<i>We had several attacks of well over 620 Gbps with no impact at all on our players. Their gaming experience remained uninterrupted and fast, thanks to Cloudflare Magic Transit</i>.”- <b>Simon Collins-Laflamme, CEO, Hypixel Inc.</b></p></blockquote><p>Hypixel’s journey with Cloudflare began with them employing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-spectrum/\">Cloudflare Spectrum</a> to help protect their gaming infrastructure against DDoS attacks.
