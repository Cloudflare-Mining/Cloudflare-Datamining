Having a system with a sufficient level of granularity to do this is crucial to meet both regulatory and security requirements. But there is a potential downside to so many controls: in order to troubleshoot user issues, an administrator has to consider a complex combination of variables across applications, user identity, and device information, which may require painstakingly sifting through logs.</p><p>We think there’s a better way — which is why, starting today, administrators can easily audit all active user sessions and associated data used by their Cloudflare One policies. This enables the best of both worlds: extremely granular controls, while maintaining an improved ability to troubleshoot and diagnose <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust</a> deployments in a single, simple control panel.

A JWT includes a payload that encodes information about the user and possibly other data, and it&#39;s signed by the server to prevent tampering. JWTs are often used in a stateless manner, meaning the server doesn&#39;t keep a copy of each JWT—it simply verifies and decodes them as they come in with requests. The stateless nature of JWTs means that you do not have to rely on a central system to handle user session management which avoids creating scalability issues as the number of users accessing a system increases.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5ffaX3vfbgBu5rBy0H1gmR/cfb1f19ef8e6b6a7077997e23cd44e9e/image2-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1470\" height=\"662\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>However, this stateless nature of JWTs makes debugging JWT-based authentication tricky without getting the specific JWT from a user. Here&#39;s why:</p><p><b>1. Token Specificity</b>: Each JWT is specific to a user and a session. It contains information (claims) about the user, the issuing authority, the token&#39;s issuing time, expiration time, and possibly other data. Therefore, to debug a problem, you often need the exact JWT that&#39;s causing the issue.</p><p><b>2. No Server-side Records</b>: Since JWTs are stateless, the server does not store sessions by default. It can&#39;t look up past tokens or their associated state, unless it&#39;s been specifically designed to log them, which is usually not the case due to privacy and data minimization considerations.</p><p><b>3. Transient Issues</b>: Problems with JWTs can be transient—they might relate to the specific moment the token was used. For instance, if a token was expired when a user tried to use it, you&#39;d need that specific token to debug the issue.</p><p><b>4. Privacy and Security</b>: JWTs can contain sensitive information, so they should be handled with care. Getting a JWT from a user might expose their personal information or security credentials to whoever is debugging the issue. In addition, if a user sends their JWT through an insecure channel to a developer or an IT help desk, it could be intercepted (Cloudflare recently released a free <a href=\"/introducing-har-sanitizer-secure-har-sharing/\">HAR Sanitizer</a> to help mitigate this concern).</p><p>These factors make it difficult to troubleshoot issues with JWT based authentication without having the specific token in question.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/31Aj21p1ndlk45ONfHg7n5/93425af409d59da01c5792f0a8b6b7d8/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1825\" height=\"740\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"a-better-way-to-debug-identity-issues\"><b>A better way to debug identity issues</b></h3>\n            <a href=\"#a-better-way-to-debug-identity-issues\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>We set out to build a better way to debug issues related to a user’s identity in Cloudflare Zero Trust without sharing JWTs or HAR files back and forth.
