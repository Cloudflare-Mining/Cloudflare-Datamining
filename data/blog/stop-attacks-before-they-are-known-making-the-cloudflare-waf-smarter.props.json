But they have a problem: if a rule is not written for a specific attack, it will not detect it.</p><p>Today, we are solving this problem by making our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">WAF</a> smarter and announcing our WAF attack scoring system in general availability.</p><p>Customers on our Enterprise Core and Advanced Security bundles will have gradual access to this new feature. All remaining Enterprise customers will gain access over the coming months.</p><p>Our WAF attack scoring system, fully complementary to our Cloudflare Managed Rules, classifies all requests using a model trained on observed true positives across the Cloudflare network, allowing you to detect (and block) evasion, bypass and new attack techniques before they are publicly known.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"the-problem-with-signature-based-wafs\">The problem with signature based WAFs</h2>\n            <a href=\"#the-problem-with-signature-based-wafs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Attackers trying to infiltrate web applications often use known or recently disclosed payloads.

All charts will be updated automatically according to the selected filters.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1OzYL2gC8J4Eul4rGy7WTZ/82f2d21878900893672b8fcac74571f6/image8.png\" alt=\"Snapshot shows insights usage to propagate multiple filters at once\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1986\" height=\"834\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Step 4</b> - verify the attack traffic: This can be done by expanding the sampled logs below the traffic distribution graph, for instance in the below expanded log, you can see a very low RCE score indicating an “Attack”, along with Bot score indicating that the request was “Likely Automated”. Looking at the “Path” field, we can confirm that indeed this is a malicious request. Note that not all fields are currently logged/shown. For example a request might receive a low score due to a malicious payload in the HTTP body which cannot be easily verified in the sample logs today.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6EBEaIA2jadEY4X65fR3Sd/079466cb5fba24e54ef2eddf00fe0352/image3-2.png\" alt=\"Expanded log of an attack from the new analytics view\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1724\" height=\"1250\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>Step 5</b> - create a rule to mitigate the attack traffic: Once you have verified that your filter is not matching false positives, by using a single click on the “Create custom rule” button, you will be directed to the WAF Custom Rules builder with all your filters pre-populated and ready for you to “Deploy”.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"attack-scores-in-security-event-logs\">Attack scores in Security Event logs</h3>\n            <a href=\"#attack-scores-in-security-event-logs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>WAF Attack Scores are also available in <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields/zone/http_requests/\">HTTP logs</a>, and by navigating to (<b>Security &gt; Events)</b> when expanding any of the event log samples:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1ypnJCxaCSKPyKpplU9ZpZ/1265e36223de98d5714a8f113173cc40/image2-7.png\" alt=\"Expanded log in the security events tab highlighting WAF attack scores\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1822\" height=\"1124\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Note that all the new fields are available in WAF Custom Rules and WAF Rate Limiting Rules.
