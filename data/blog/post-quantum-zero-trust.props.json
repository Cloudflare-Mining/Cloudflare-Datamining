Recent <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/\"><u>breakthroughs</u></a> in quantum computing have underscored the vulnerability of conventional cryptography to these attacks. Since 2017, Cloudflare has <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/post-quantum/\"><u>been at the forefront</u></a> of developing, standardizing, and implementing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/quantum/what-is-post-quantum-cryptography/\"><u>post-quantum cryptography</u></a> to withstand attacks by quantum computers. </p><p>Our mission is simple: we want every Cloudflare customer to have a clear path to quantum safety. Cloudflare recognizes the urgency, so we’re committed to managing the complex process of upgrading cryptographic algorithms, so that you don’t have to worry about it. We&#39;re not just talking about doing it. <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption-adoption\"><u>Over 35% of the non-bot HTTPS traffic that touches Cloudflare today is post-quantum secure.</u></a> </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/\"><u>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</u></a> also recognizes the urgency of this transition. On November 15, 2024, NIST made a landmark <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf\"><u>announcement</u></a> by setting a timeline to phase out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)\"><u>RSA</u></a> and <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/\"><u>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</u></a>, the conventional cryptographic algorithms that underpin nearly every part of the Internet today. According to NIST’s announcement, these algorithms will be deprecated by 2030 and completely disallowed by 2035.</p><p>At Cloudflare, we aren’t waiting until 2035 or even 2030. We believe privacy is a fundamental human right, and advanced cryptography should be <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-crypto-should-be-free/\"><u>accessible to everyone</u></a> without compromise. No one should be required to pay extra for post-quantum security. That’s why any visitor accessing a <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/\"><u>website protected by Cloudflare today</u></a> benefits from post-quantum cryptography, when using a major browser like <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/advancing-our-amazing-bet-on-asymmetric.html\"><u>Chrome, Edge</u></a>, or <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/135.0/releasenotes/\"><u>Firefox</u></a>. (And, we are excited to see a <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=http&groupBy=post_quantum&filters=botClass%253DLikely_Human%252Cos%253DiOS\"><u>small percentage of (mobile) Safari traffic</u></a> in our Radar data.) Well over a third of the human traffic passing through Cloudflare today already enjoys this enhanced security, and we expect this share to increase as more browsers and clients are upgraded to support post-quantum cryptography. </p><p>While great strides have been made to protect human web traffic, not every application is a web application. And every organization has internal applications (both web and otherwise) that do not support post-quantum cryptography.  </p><p>How should organizations go about upgrading their sensitive corporate network traffic to support post-quantum cryptography?</p><p>That’s where today’s announcement comes in. We’re thrilled to announce the first phase of end-to-end quantum readiness of our Zero Trust platform<b>, </b>allowing customers to protect their corporate network traffic with post-quantum cryptography.<b> Organizations can tunnel their corporate network traffic though Cloudflare’s Zero Trust platform, protecting it against quantum adversaries without the hassle of individually upgrading each and every corporate application, system, or network connection.</b> </p><p>More specifically, organizations can use our Zero Trust platform to route communications from end-user devices (via web browser or Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/\"><u>WARP device client</u></a>) to secure applications connected with <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-tunnel/\"><u>Cloudflare Tunnel</u></a>, to gain end-to-end quantum safety, in the following use cases: </p><ul><li><p><b>Cloudflare’s clientless </b><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/\"><b><u>Access</u></b></a><b>: </b>Our clientless Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution verifies user identity and device context for every HTTPS request to corporate applications from a web browser.

The challenge of deprecating cryptography</h4><p>History shows that updating or removing outdated cryptographic algorithms from live systems is extremely difficult. For example, although the MD5 hash function was <a href=\"https://iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2005/34940019/34940019.pdf\"><u>deemed insecure in 2004</u></a> and long since deprecated, it was still in use with the RADIUS enterprise authentication protocol as recently as 2024. In July 2024, Cloudflare contributed to research revealing an <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/radius-udp-vulnerable-md5-attack/\"><u>attack on RADIUS</u></a> that exploited its reliance on MD5. This example underscores the enormous challenge of updating legacy systems — this difficulty in achieving <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_agility\"><i><u>crypto-agility</u></i></a> — which will be just as demanding when it’s time to transition to post-quantum cryptography. So it makes sense to start this process now.</p><h4>2. The “harvest now, decrypt later” threat</h4><p>Even though quantum computers lack enough qubits to break conventional cryptography today, adversaries can harvest and store encrypted communications or steal datasets with the intent of decrypting them once quantum technology matures. If your encrypted data today could become a liability in 10 to 15 years, planning for a post-quantum future is essential. For this reason, we have already started working with some of the most innovative banks, ISPs, and governments around the world as they begin their journeys to quantum safety. </p><p>The U.S. government is already addressing these risks. On January 16, 2025, the White House issued <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/17/2025-01470/strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity\"><u>Executive Order 14144</u></a> on Strengthening and Promoting Innovation in the Nation’s Cybersecurity. This order requires government agencies to “<i>regularly update a list of product categories in which products that support post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are widely available…. Within 90 days of a product category being placed on the list … agencies shall take steps to include in any solicitations for products in that category a requirement that products support PQC.</i>”</p><p>At Cloudflare, we’ve been <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/\"><u>researching</u></a>, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/securing-the-post-quantum-world/\"><u>developing</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-mlkem-02.html\"><u>standardizing</u></a> post-quantum cryptography <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/post-quantum/\"><u>since 2017</u></a>. Our strategy is simple:</p><p><b>Simply tunnel your traffic through Cloudflare’s quantum-safe connections to immediately protect against harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks, without the burden of upgrading every cryptographic library yourself.</b></p><p>Let’s take a closer look at how the migration to post-quantum cryptography is taking shape at Cloudflare.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"a-two-phase-migration-to-post-quantum-cryptography\">A two-phase migration to post-quantum cryptography</h3>\n            <a href=\"#a-two-phase-migration-to-post-quantum-cryptography\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>At Cloudflare, we’ve largely focused on migrating the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/\"><u>TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.3</u></a> protocol to post-quantum cryptography.   TLS primarily secures the communications for web applications, but it is also widely used to secure email, messaging, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/zero-trust-warp-with-a-masque/\"><u>VPN connections</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-over-tls/\"><u>DNS</u></a>, and many other protocols.  This makes TLS an ideal protocol to focus on when migrating to post-quantum cryptography.</p><p>The migration involves updating two critical components of TLS 1.3: <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/\"><u>digital signatures used in certificates</u></a> and <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-key-encapsulation/\"><u>key agreement mechanisms</u></a>. We’ve made significant progress on key agreement, but the migration to post-quantum digital signatures is still in its early stages.</p><h4>Phase 1: Migrating key agreement</h4><p>Key agreement protocols enable two parties to securely establish a shared secret key that they can use to secure and encrypt their communications. Today, vendors have largely converged on transitioning TLS 1.3 to support a post-quantum key exchange protocol known as <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/nists-first-post-quantum-standards/\"><u>ML-KEM</u></a> (Module-lattice based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard). There are two main reasons for prioritizing migration of key agreement:</p><ul><li><p><b>Performance:</b> ML-KEM <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/\"><u>performs</u></a> well with the TLS 1.3 protocol, even for short-lived network connections.</p></li><li><p><b>Security</b>: Conventional cryptography is vulnerable to “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. In this threat model, an adversary intercepts and stores encrypted communications today and later (in the future) uses a quantum computer to derive the secret key, compromising the communication. As of March 2025, well over a third of the human web traffic reaching the Cloudflare network is protected against these attacks by TLS 1.3 with hybrid ML-KEM key exchange.</p></li></ul>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1Tgfy0HYHA5MM6JjaNP2Z1/b601d2938be3c52decf1f3cec7313c6e/image6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1866\" height=\"518\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Post-quantum encrypted share of human HTTPS request traffic seen by Cloudflare per </i></sup><a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage?dateRange=52w\"><sup><i><u>Cloudflare Radar</u></i></sup></a><sup><i> from March 1, 2024 to March 1, 2025.

This provides the protection of the tried-and-true conventional cryptography (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519\"><u>X25519</u></a>) alongside the new post-quantum key agreement (<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/nists-first-post-quantum-standards/\"><u>ML-KEM</u></a>).</p><h4>Phase 2: Migrating digital signatures</h4><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/\"><u>Digital signatures are used in TLS certificates</u></a> to validate the authenticity of connections — allowing the client to be sure that it is really communicating with the server, and not with an adversary that is impersonating the server. </p><p>Post-quantum digital signatures, however, are significantly larger, and thus slower, than their current counterparts. This performance impact has slowed their adoption, particularly because they slow down short-lived TLS connections. </p><p>Fortunately, post-quantum signatures are not needed to prevent harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks. Instead, they primarily protect against attacks by an adversary that is actively using a quantum computer to tamper with a live TLS connection. We still have some time before quantum computers are able to do this, making the migration of digital signatures a lower priority.</p><p>Nevertheless, Cloudflare is actively <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates/07/\"><u>involved in standardizing</u></a> post-quantum signatures for TLS certificates. We are also experimenting with their deployment on long-lived TLS connections and exploring <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/\"><u>new approaches</u></a> to achieve post-quantum authentication without sacrificing performance. Our goal is to ensure that post-quantum digital signatures are ready for widespread use when quantum computers are able to actively attack live TLS connections.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"cloudflare-zero-trust-pqc-future-proofing-security\">Cloudflare Zero Trust + PQC: future-proofing security</h3>\n            <a href=\"#cloudflare-zero-trust-pqc-future-proofing-security\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The Cloudflare Zero Trust platform replaces legacy corporate security perimeters with Cloudflare&#39;s global network, making access to the Internet and to corporate resources faster and safer for teams around the world.

This tunnel is secured using TLS 1.3 with post-quantum key agreement, safeguarding it from harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks.</p></li></ul><p>Putting it together, clientless Access provides <b>end-to-end</b> quantum safety for accessing corporate HTTPS applications, without requiring customers to upgrade the security of corporate web applications.</p><h4>Quantum-safe Zero Trust with Cloudflare’s WARP Client-to-Tunnel configuration (as a VPN replacement)</h4><p>By mid-2025, organizations will be able to protect <b>any protocol</b>, not just HTTPS, by tunneling it through Cloudflare&#39;s Zero Trust platform with post quantum cryptography, thus providing quantum safety as traffic travels across the Internet from the end-user’s device to the corporate office/data center/cloud environment.</p><p>Cloudflare’s Zero Trust platform is ideal for replacing traditional VPNs, and enabling <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final\"><u>Zero Trust architectures</u></a> with modern authentication and authorization polices.  Cloudflare’s WARP client-to-tunnel is a popular network configuration for our Zero Trust platform: organizations deploy Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/\"><u>WARP device client</u></a> on their end users’ devices, and then use <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/\"><u>Cloudflare Tunnel</u></a> to connect to their corporate office, cloud, or data center environments.   </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5xovIIyVOO32xrXBs0ZFcf/110928926b86f12777f16518b1313875/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1548\" height=\"525\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p> Here are the details:  </p><ul><li><p><b>PQ connection via WARP client (coming in mid-2025): </b>(Labeled (1) in the figure)\nThe WARP client uses the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/zero-trust-warp-with-a-masque/\"><u>MASQUE protocol</u></a> to connect from the device to Cloudflare’s global network. We are working to add support for establishing this MASQUE connection with TLS 1.3 with post-quantum key agreement, with a target completion date of mid-2025.  </p></li><li><p><b>PQ within Cloudflare’s global network:  </b>(Labeled (2) in the figure) \nAs traffic moves from one datacenter to another inside Cloudflare’s global network, each hop it takes through Cloudflare’s network is already secured with TLS 1.3 with post-quantum key agreement.</p></li><li><p><b>PQ Cloudflare Tunnel: </b>(Labeled (3) in the figure)\nAs mentioned above, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/\"><u>Cloudflare Tunnel</u></a> already supports post-quantum key agreement. </p></li></ul><p>Once the upcoming post-quantum enhancements to the WARP device client are complete, customers can encapsulate their traffic in quantum-safe tunnels, effectively mitigating the risk of harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks without any heavy lifting to individually upgrade their networks or applications.  And this provides comprehensive protection for any protocol that can be sent through these tunnels, not just for HTTPS!</p><h4>Quantum-safe SWG (end-to-end PQC for access to third-party web applications)</h4><p>A <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/\"><u>Secure Web Gateway</u></a> (SWG) is used to secure access to third-party websites on the public Internet by intercepting and inspecting TLS traffic. </p><p>Cloudflare Gateway is now a quantum-safe SWG for HTTPS traffic. As long as the third-party website that is being inspected supports post-quantum key agreement, then Cloudflare’s SWG also supports post-quantum key agreement. This holds regardless of the onramp that the customer uses to get to Cloudflare&#39;s network (i.e. <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/\"><u>web browser</u></a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/\"><u>WARP device client</u></a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/warp-connector/\"><u>WARP Connector</u></a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/\"><u>Magic WAN</u></a>), and only requires the use of a browser that supports post-quantum key agreement.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6vnkEFkvKbhSAxp33GmRk7/c58d00a14767a03b2422af1c48a53ba9/image5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1488\" height=\"700\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Cloudflare Gateway&#39;s HTTPS SWG feature involves two post-quantum TLS connections, as follows:</p><ul><li><p><b>PQ connection via browser: </b>(Labeled (1) in the figure)  \nA TLS connection is initiated from the user&#39;s browser to a data center in Cloudflare&#39;s network that performs the TLS inspection. As long as the user&#39;s web browser supports post-quantum key agreement, this connection is secured by TLS 1.3 with post-quantum key agreement.  </p></li><li><p><b>PQ connection to the origin server: </b>(Labeled (2) in the figure)  \nA TLS connection is initiated from a datacenter in Cloudflare&#39;s network to the origin server, which is typically controlled by a third party. The connection from Cloudflare’s SWG currently supports post-quantum key agreement, as long as the third party’s origin server also already supports post-quantum key agreement.  You can test this out today by using <a href=\"https://pq.cloudflareresearch.com/\"><u>https://pq.cloudflareresearch.com/</u></a> as your third-party origin server. </p></li></ul><p>Put together, Cloudflare’s SWG is quantum-ready to support secure access to any third-party website that is quantum ready today or in the future. And this is true regardless of the onramp used to get end users&#39; traffic into Cloudflare&#39;s global network!</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-post-quantum-future-cloudflares-zero-trust-platform-leads-the-way\">The post-quantum future: Cloudflare’s Zero Trust platform leads the way</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-post-quantum-future-cloudflares-zero-trust-platform-leads-the-way\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Protecting our customers from emerging quantum threats isn&#39;t just a priority — it&#39;s our responsibility.
