Recent <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/\"><u>breakthroughs</u></a> in quantum computing have underscored the vulnerability of conventional cryptography to these attacks. Since 2017, Cloudflare has <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/post-quantum/\"><u>been at the forefront</u></a> of developing, standardizing, and implementing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/quantum/what-is-post-quantum-cryptography/\"><u>post-quantum cryptography</u></a> to withstand attacks by quantum computers. </p><p>Our mission is simple: we want every Cloudflare customer to have a clear path to quantum safety. Cloudflare recognizes the urgency, so we’re committed to managing the complex process of upgrading cryptographic algorithms, so that you don’t have to worry about it. We&#39;re not just talking about doing it. <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption-adoption\"><u>Over 35% of the non-bot HTTPS traffic that touches Cloudflare today is post-quantum secure.</u></a> </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/\"><u>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</u></a> also recognizes the urgency of this transition. On November 15, 2024, NIST made a landmark <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf\"><u>announcement</u></a> by setting a timeline to phase out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)\"><u>RSA</u></a> and <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/\"><u>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</u></a>, the conventional cryptographic algorithms that underpin nearly every part of the Internet today. According to NIST’s announcement, these algorithms will be deprecated by 2030 and completely disallowed by 2035.</p><p>At Cloudflare, we aren’t waiting until 2035 or even 2030. We believe privacy is a fundamental human right, and advanced cryptography should be <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-crypto-should-be-free/\"><u>accessible to everyone</u></a> without compromise. No one should be required to pay extra for post-quantum security. That’s why any visitor accessing a <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/\"><u>website protected by Cloudflare today</u></a> benefits from post-quantum cryptography, when using a major browser like <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/advancing-our-amazing-bet-on-asymmetric.html\"><u>Chrome, Edge</u></a>, or <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/135.0/releasenotes/\"><u>Firefox</u></a>. (And, we are excited to see a <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=http&groupBy=post_quantum&filters=botClass%253DLikely_Human%252Cos%253DiOS\"><u>small percentage of (mobile) Safari traffic</u></a> in our Radar data.) Well over a third of the human traffic passing through Cloudflare today already enjoys this enhanced security, and we expect this share to increase as more browsers and clients are upgraded to support post-quantum cryptography. </p><p>While great strides have been made to protect human web traffic, not every application is a web application. And every organization has internal applications (both web and otherwise) that do not support post-quantum cryptography.  </p><p>How should organizations go about upgrading their sensitive corporate network traffic to support post-quantum cryptography?</p><p>That’s where today’s announcement comes in. We’re thrilled to announce the first phase of end-to-end quantum readiness of our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/\">Zero Trust platform</a><b>, </b>allowing customers to protect their corporate network traffic with post-quantum cryptography.<b> Organizations can tunnel their corporate network traffic though Cloudflare’s Zero Trust platform, protecting it against quantum adversaries without the hassle of individually upgrading each and every corporate application, system, or network connection.</b> </p><p>More specifically, organizations can use our Zero Trust platform to route communications from end-user devices (via web browser or Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/\"><u>WARP device client</u></a>) to secure applications connected with <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-tunnel/\"><u>Cloudflare Tunnel</u></a>, to gain end-to-end quantum safety, in the following use cases: </p><ul><li><p><b>Cloudflare’s clientless </b><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/\"><b><u>Access</u></b></a><b>: </b>Our clientless <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/\">Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)</a> solution verifies user identity and device context for every HTTPS request to corporate applications from a web browser. Clientless Access is now protected end-to-end with post-quantum cryptography.</p></li><li><p><b>Cloudflare’s </b><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/\"><b><u>WARP device client</u></b></a><b>:</b> By mid-2025, customers using the WARP device client will have all of their traffic (regardless of protocol) tunneled over a connection protected by post-quantum cryptography. The WARP client secures corporate devices by privately routing their traffic to Cloudflare&#39;s global network, where Gateway applies advanced web filtering and Access enforces policies for secure access to applications. </p></li><li><p><b>Cloudflare </b><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/\"><b><u>Gateway</u></b></a>: Our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/\">Secure Web Gateway (SWG) </a>— designed to inspect and filter TLS traffic in order to block threats and unauthorized communications — now supports TLS with post-quantum cryptography. </p></li></ul><p>In the remaining sections of this post, we’ll explore the threat that quantum computing poses and the challenges organizations face in transitioning to post-quantum cryptography.

As we continue to advance the state of the art in post-quantum cryptography, our commitment to continuous innovation ensures that your organization stays ahead of tomorrow&#39;s threats.  Let us worry about crypto-agility so that you don’t have to.</p><p>To learn more about how Cloudflare’s built-in crypto-agility can future-proof your business, visit our <a href=\"http://cloudflare.com/pqc\"><u>Post-Quantum Cryptography</u></a> webpage.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"watch-on-cloudflare-tv\">Watch on Cloudflare TV</h3>\n      <a href=\"#watch-on-cloudflare-tv\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https://customer-rhnwzxvb3mg4wz3v.cloudflarestream.com/c56bd2057e4348ab109d93dfa543f6ba/iframe?preload=true&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fcustomer-rhnwzxvb3mg4wz3v.cloudflarestream.com%2Fc56bd2057e4348ab109d93dfa543f6ba%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D%26height%3D600\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\"\n    allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n  ></iframe>\n</div><p></p>",
