Many organizations use physical or virtual SD-WAN appliances today to route or tunnel traffic between offices, data centers, and public clouds. Starting today, these customers can leverage their existing infrastructure investments — physical or virtual in the cloud — to connect traffic to Magic WAN with a few simple commands.</p><p>Consider the sample setup below. Magic WAN + Network Onramp Partners allows you to connect on-premise and cloud VPCs in RFC1918 subnets using both physical and virtual appliances, with Magic WAN providing accelerated and secure connectivity. Additionally, Magic Firewall allows you to configure and enforce firewall rules at edge and consistently across all traffic that flows through Magic WAN. Cloudflare’s broad network reach in 200+ cities also means the nearest data center is always close by.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7LhZMqMeFjhSD8t3sqmAz8/0e1e3513c55a3d908cbeca7414175b78/image4-20.png\" alt=\"3 private networks, using a mixture of a partner hardware appliance, a partner virtual AMI, and a generic Linux router connected to Cloudflare Magic WAN via the nearest Cloudflare data center.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1566\" height=\"1124\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>3 private networks, using a mixture of a partner hardware appliance, a partner virtual AMI, and a generic Linux router connected to Cloudflare Magic WAN via the nearest Cloudflare data center.</i></p><p>While simple setup and compatibility are great, our shared roadmap with our partners is much more ambitious.
