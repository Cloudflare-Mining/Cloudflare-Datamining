RPKI is defined in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6480\">RFC6480</a> (An Infrastructure to Support Secure Internet Routing). Cloudflare commits to RPKI.</p><p>Because any route can be originated and announced by any random network, independent of its rights to announce that route, there needs to be an out-of-band method to help BGP manage which network can announce which route. That system exists today. It&#39;s part of the <a href=\"http://www.irr.net/\">IRR</a> (Internet Routing Registry) system. Many registries exist, some run by networks, some by RIRs (Regional Internet Registries) and the grand daddy of IRRs, Merit&#39;s <a href=\"https://radb.net\">RADB</a> service. This service provides a collective method to allow one network to filter another networks routes.</p><p>This works somewhat. An invalid announcement is normally squashed near-instantly as the route crosses an ASN boundary because one network is meant to filter the other network (based on rules created from the IRR database). This of course doesn’t happen perfectly - in fact, far from it. Route leaks or route hijacks happen more often than they should. A fact that is well documented. Here’s the highlights:</p><ul><li><p>1997 - AS7007 mistakenly (re)announces 72,000+ routes (becomes the poster-child for route filtering).</p></li><li><p>2008 - ISP in Pakistan <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2008/02/pakistans-accid/\">accidentally</a> announces IP routes for YouTube by blackholing the video service internally to their network.</p></li><li><p>2017 - Russian ISP leaks 36 prefixes for payments services owned by Mastercard, Visa, and major banks.</p></li><li><p>2018 - BGP hijack of Amazon DNS to <a href=\"/bgp-leaks-and-crypto-currencies/\">steal crypto currency</a>.</p></li></ul><p>That’s just a partial list! Each route leak or hijack exposes a lack of route filtering by the network that peers or transits the offending network.</p><p>RPKI comes into the picture because the existing IRR system lacks any form of cryptographic signing for its data. In fact, today the IRR databases contain plenty of invalid data (both stale data and typo’ed data). There&#39;s very little control over the creation of invalid data.</p><p>Implementing RPKI is just the first step in better BGP route security because RPKI only secures the route origin; it doesn&#39;t secure the path. (Sadly the same is true for IRR data). When we want to secure the path; we are going to need something else; but that comes later.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-rpki-tl-dr\">The RPKI TL;DR</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-rpki-tl-dr\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>BGP routing isn’t secure.

BGP on the global Internet doubly-so. This fact should not deter either the casual reader or the seasoned network engineer. What is important is to place the limit around what is worth knowing about and discarding all the minor items that make up the very complex world of BGP networking. In fact, to operate a BGP enabled network connected to a telco or ISP isn’t that complicated. It turns out that in the world of BGP, security is an afterthought.</p><p>Lets begin.</p><p>I’m going to pick a hypothetical example. The configuration of a single university within a country that operates an NREN (National Research &amp; Education Network) for all it&#39;s universities. This is not uncommon. The university in this case is connected via a single telecommunications link and (using BGP terminology) has a single upstream. The NREN provides all the connectivity to the local and global Internet for its countries universities, along with connectivity to other NRENs in other countries.</p><p>We start with some basics. BGP is about numbers. First off is a unique number called the Autonomous System Number or ASN. This number comes from a range of numbers that are managed by the RIRs (Regional Internet Registries). For example, Cloudflare has the AS number 13335 allocated for its network. ASNs were just 16-bit numbers, but are now 32-bit numbers (because the internet grew to the point of running out of the 65,536 or 2^16 initial allocation). For our university, we will use 65099 as our example ASN. This is from the reserved block of ASNs and used here for documentation reasons only.</p><p>The second number is the IP addresses allocated to the university. Most reader are familiar with IP addresses; however in the BGP world we use IP blocks called CIDRs (Classless Inter-Domain Routing). This is a range of IP addresses that are sequential and bonded on binary boundaries. Within Cloudflare, we have quite a few IP blocks allocated by the RIRs. For our example, we will assume the university has two blocks allocated. 10.0.0.0/8 and 2001:db8::/32 . Both these are private or documentation addresses and later-on you’ll see these show up again in a different manner when we talk about filtering.</p><p>This is enough for us to get this university ready to connect to the NREN. Or maybe not.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"ready-to-connect\">Ready to connect</h3>\n      <a href=\"#ready-to-connect\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Hold on a second - there’s paperwork to fill-in.

Records exist within IRRs that are both clearly wrong and/or are clearly missing. There’s no cryptographic signing of records. There are multiple suppliers of IRR data; some better than others. IRR still has some proponents that want to clean up its operational data (including the author of this blog). Efforts like <a href=\"https://github.com/irrdnet/irrd4/\">IRRD4</a> (by Job Snijders @ NTT) could help clean-up IRR usage. IRR is not the main focus herein.</p><p>Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a cryptographic method of signing records that associate a route with an originating AS number. Presently the five RIRs (AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC &amp; RIPE) provide a method for members to take an IP/ASN pair and sign a ROA (Route Origin Authorization) record. The ROA record is what we need to focus on.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5vo7EQoqPim1Fq7Qio5Wqg/81e59bf19ec648db71369a272374a69b/roas_3x-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1471\" height=\"1032\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Once a route is signed; it can propagate to anyone that wants to use the data to filter routing or monitor this data as ROAs are public. A ROA is a digitally signed object that makes use of <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3852\">RFC3852</a> Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) as a standard encapsulation format. In fact ROAs are X.509 certificates as defined in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280\">RFC5280</a> (Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate) and <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3779\">RFC3779</a> (X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers).</p><p>As the ROA is a digitally signed object, it provides a means of verifying that an IP address block holder has authorized an AS (Autonomous System) to originate routes to that one or more prefixes within the address block.

This makes sense. Only the RIRs know who is an owner of IP space (and ASs). The present day RPKI systems operate in conjunction with existing RIR login credentials. Once you can login to a portal and control your IP allocations and ASN allocations; then you can also create, edit, modify, and delete RPKI data in the forms of ROAs. This is the basis of how RPKI separates itself from the IRR. You can only sign your own resources. You can’t just randomly create data. If you lose your RIR allocation, then you lose the RPKI data.From a policy point of view, there are some interesting issues that become apparent pretty quickly. First off, an ISP with an allocation needs to keep its RIR membership up to date (i.e. pay its dues). Second, it needs to be aware that the RIR and the ISP could be legal entities based in different countries and hence international law plays a role in any dispute between the ISP and RIR or in fact any third party that gets involved in an IP address dispute. This has been a concern within the RIPE (Europe, the Middle East and parts of Central Asia) region as RIPE is based in The Netherlands. Similarly, ARIN (North America and parts of the Caribbean) is a US entity.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"which-rir-for-which-ip-address\">Which RIR for which IP address?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#which-rir-for-which-ip-address\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Presently, because of the large amount of IP address transfers occurring between some RIR regions, the RIRs changed their TA root certificates so that each RIR includes every available IP address (0.0.0.0/0 &amp; ::/0) and every available AS number (0-4,294,967,295).

When the router sees a new route, the router send a simple message across a communications path (that includes the origin AS plus the IP route). The server, running a validator, responds with a yes/no answer that drives the filtering of that BGP route. This lightweight protocol is defined in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6810\">RFC6810</a>, then updated later to include some BGPsec support in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8210\">RFC8210</a> (The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router Protocol). This lightweight protocol is nicknamed “RTR”.</p><p>Present implementations include <a href=\"https://github.com/rtrlib/rtrlib\">https://github.com/rtrlib/rtrlib</a> (in ‘C’) and NIST’s package <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/bgp-secure-routing-extension-bgp-srx-prototype\">https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/bgp-secure-routing-extension-bgp-srx-prototype</a> which is based on quagga; hence not usable in production.</p><p>Operationally, neither are fully usable within production environments.The RIPE validator <a href=\"https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/rpki-validator-3\">https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/rpki-validator-3</a> (written in Java) can produce filter sets similar to IRR tools and seems to be the most prevalent tool for the limited number of RPKI setups found in networks today.

No. Maybe. Ask your lawyers.</p><p>For many years there’s been a solid discussion about the role of the RIRs as holders of the private key of the CA at the top of their tree. Five trees. IANA was meant to run a single root above them (similar to how DNSSEC works with one key held at the DNS root - or dot); but that didn’t happen for many reasons including the fact that IANA/ICANN was essentially reporting to the US government back when this was all being setup. The RIR setup has stuck and at this point no-one expects IANA to ever hold a single root certificate, plus it’s all historic at this point and not worth rehashing here.</p><p>This is not a major operational issue; however it does have some slight consequences. While having five roots could be considered a messy setup, it actually matches the web space CA model.</p><p>Some RIR regions have special issues. <a href=\"https://arin.net/\">ARIN</a> (in North America and portions of the Caribbean) has a TA and ROAs; but wants full indemnification should the data be wrong or used incorrectly. In the <a href=\"https://ripe.net/\">RIPE</a> region (Europe, ME &amp; Russia), the members voted down full support for RPKI because they didn’t want to have a Dutch entity (RIPE NCC) hold a certificate for a non-Dutch entity and have a Dutch LEA letter shutdown a network by forcing that certificate to be invalidated.

There’s efforts underway to make IRR data cleaner, and in some cases, to (finally) link the underlying RPKI &amp; IRR data together. They are very similar data; but with different security models.</p><p>This blog post was written with RPKI as the go-forward methodology in mind and hence does not need to address all the subtle issues around IRR brokenness. It would be a whole fresh blog post to address the legacy issues within IRR. That said, it’s clear that RPKI isn’t today a complete substitute for all the IRR data (and RPSL/RPSLng data) that exists today. The good news is that there’s work within the IETF and drafts in-flight to cover that. RPKI is a good protocol to base route filtering on and Cloudflare will be rolling out full support for RPKI enabled filtering and route announcements within its global network.</p><p>If you look back at the examples above of the university and its NREN, then realize that in the RPKI world the same information is being stored; however, the validity and attestation of the data increases n-fold once RPKI becomes the universal mechanism of choice.</p><p>Cloudflare wants to see this happen and will push for RPKI to become mainstream within the BGP world.
