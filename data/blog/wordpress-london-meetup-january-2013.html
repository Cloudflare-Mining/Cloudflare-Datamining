	<p>Last night I gave a short presentation about how to use CloudFlare with WordPress sites to about 60 people attending the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-WordPress/events/81910532/" target="_blank">WordPress London Meetup</a>. CloudFlare was happy to be sponsor of the event providing drinks, beers and lots and lots of pizza. The meetup was held at the <a href="http://www.campuslondon.com" target="_blank">Google Campus</a>.</p>

	<p>There were two talks: I was preceded by designer <a href="http://laurakalbag.com/" target="_blank">Laura Kalbag</a> who talked about designing icons for WordPress sites. This is something that she made look incredibly easy using a tool called <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch</a>. I suspect that however good Sketch is, I'd end up drawing icons that looked awful!</p>
	<p>My talk was about using WordPress and CloudFlare together. CloudFlare has a ton of features and I highlighted some that are of great interest to WordPress users including the <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cloudflare/" target="_blank">CloudFlare WordPress Plugin</a> and our integration with <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/w3-total-cache-w3tc-total-cloudflare-integrat">W3TC</a>.</p>
	<p>The other features that people found most interesting were:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/always-online-v2">Always Online</a>:
			CloudFlare crawls the WordPress site and keeps a copy in a special cache. If the original site goes down CloudFlare serves up the most recent version from the crawler cache with a banner indicating that it is old content. This helps keep sites online when things go badly wrong.</li>
		<li><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/an-all-new-and-improved-autominify">Auto-minify</a>: many WordPress sites have large amount of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (especially if they use lots of plugins). Auto-minify helps shrink those resources so that sites are delivered faster to web browsers.</li>
		<li><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/56590463">Rocket Loader</a>: a tool that reorganizes the loading of resources such as CSS and JavaScript to that they are downloaded to web browsers quickly by bundling them.</li>
		<li>A new, unannounced feature that I'm calling "Help, I've gone viral!" which allows any web site owner to instantly tell CloudFlare to start completely caching a URL (overriding any caching headers set by the site) to cope with load. With this if a URL goes viral and is overloading a WordPress site it's possible to just paste in its URL and ask CloudFlare to take the load of that page. We'll be writing more about that feature when it's released.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>And, of course, other CloudFlare features like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/easiest-ssl-ever-now-included-automatically-w">Easy SSL</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/spdy-now-one-click-simple-for-any-website">SPDY</a>, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa">IPv6</a> help everyone get the latest technology onto their site quickly.</p>
