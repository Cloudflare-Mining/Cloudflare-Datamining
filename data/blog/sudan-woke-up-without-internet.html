	<p>Today, October 25, following <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c1yy8q1re0kt/sudan-crisis">political turmoil</a>, Sudan woke up without Internet access.</p>
	<p>In our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sudans-exam-related-internet-shutdowns">June blog</a>, we talked about Sudan when the country decided to shut down the Internet to prevent cheating in exams.</p>
	<p>Now, the disruption seems to be for other reasons. <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/10/25/sudan-government-officials-detained-phones-down-in-possible-coup">AP</a> is reporting that "military forces ... detained at least five senior Sudanese government figures.". This afternoon (UTC) <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/25/sudan-army-detains-pm-hamdok-for-resisting-coup-live-news">several</a> media outlets <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/25/africa/sudan-military-prime-minister-intl-hnk/index.html">confirmed</a> that Sudan's military dissolved the transitional government in a coup that shut down mobile phone networks and Internet access.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare Radar allows anyone to track Internet traffic patterns around the world. The <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/sd?date_filter=last_24_hours">dedicated page for Sudan</a> clearly shows that this Monday, when the country was waking up, the Internet traffic went down and continued that trend through the afternoon (16:00 local time, 14:00 UTC).</p>

	<p>We dug in a little more on the HTTP traffic data. It usually starts increasing after 06:00 local time (04:00 UTC). But this Monday morning, traffic was flat, and the trend continued in the afternoon (there were no signs of the Internet coming back at 18:00 local time).</p>

	<p>When comparing today with the last seven days' pattern, we see that today's drop is abrupt and unusual.</p>

	<p>We can see the same pattern when looking at HTTP traffic by ASN (<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system">Autonomous Systems Number</a>). The shutdown affects all the major ISPs from Sudan.</p>

	<p>Two weeks ago, we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/where-mobile-traffic-more-and-less-popular">compared mobile traffic worldwide</a> using Cloudflare Radar, and Sudan was one of the most mobile-friendly countries on the planet, with 83% of Internet traffic coming from mobile devices. Today, both mobile and desktop traffic was disrupted.</p>

	<p>Using <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/sd?date_filter=last_24_hours">Cloudflare Radar,</a> we can also see a change in Layer 3&amp;4 DDoS attacks because of the lack of data.</p>
