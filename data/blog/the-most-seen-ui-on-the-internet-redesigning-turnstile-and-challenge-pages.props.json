Others were too vague to be helpful (&quot;Timed out&quot;). The visual language varied wildly — different layouts, different hierarchies, different tones of voice.</p><p>We also examined the feedback we&#39;d received online. Social media, support tickets, community forums — we read it all. The frustration was palpable, and much of it was avoidable.</p><p>Take our feedback mechanism, for example. We offered users feedback options like &quot;The widget sometimes fails&quot; versus &quot;The widget fails all the time.&quot; But what&#39;s the difference, really? And how were they supposed to know how often it failed? We were asking users to interpret ambiguous options during their most frustrated moments.

The core principle is simple: every moment a user spends trying to interpret, understand, or decode your interface is a moment of friction. And friction, especially in moments of frustration, leads to abandonment.</p><p>Our audit revealed that we were asking users to think far too much. Different pieces of information occupied the same space in the UI across different states. There was no consistent visual hierarchy. Users encountering an error state in Turnstile would find information in a completely different place than they would on a Challenge Page.</p><p>We made a fundamental decision: <b>one information architecture to rule them all</b>.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3runU0ihKhNpgdw3LxNZUv/aa4bd76efb5847fde0659bccdae7242d/7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1654\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><i>Visual diagram displaying a unified information architecture with a consistent structure across Turnstile widget and Challenge pages</i></sup></p><p>Both Turnstile and Challenge Pages would now follow the same structural pattern. The same visual hierarchy. The same placement for actions, for explanatory text, for links to documentation.</p><p>Did this constrain our design options? Absolutely. We had to say no to a lot of creative ideas that didn&#39;t fit the framework. But constraints aren&#39;t the enemy of good design — they&#39;re often its best friend. By limiting our options, we could go deeper on the details that actually mattered.</p><p>For users, the benefit is profound: they don&#39;t need to re-learn what each piece of the UI means. Error states look consistent. Help links are always in the same place. Once you understand one state, you understand them all.

My ISP?&quot; More importantly, we discovered something fundamental: at the moment of maximum frustration, people don&#39;t want to file a report — they want to fix the problem.

Everyone was trying to read it in the tiny real estate of a widget. The lesson: less is more, especially in constrained spaces during stressful moments.</p><p><b>Accessible to everyone</b>. Our audit revealed 10px fonts in some states. Grey text that technically met AA (at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text) compliance but was difficult to read in practice. &quot;Technically compliant&quot; isn&#39;t good enough when you&#39;re serving the entire Internet.</p><p>We set a clear goal: to meet the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/\"><u>WCAG 2.2 AAA</u></a> standard— the highest and most stringent level of web accessibility compliance, designed to make content accessible to the broadest range of users, including those with severe disabilities. Throughout the redesign, when visual consistency conflicted with readability, readability won. Every time.</p><p>This extended beyond vision. We designed for screen reader users, keyboard-only navigators, and people with color vision variations — going beyond what automated compliance tools can catch.</p><p>And accessibility isn&#39;t just about impairments — it&#39;s about language. What fits in English, overflows in German. What&#39;s concise in Spanish is ambiguous in Japanese. Supporting over 40 languages forced us to radically simplify.

In reality, the real challenge often lies much deeper, especially when working close to the platform primitives. Building a critical piece of Internet infrastructure using native APIs forces you to think differently about UI development, tradeoffs, and long-term maintainability.</p><p>In our case, we use Rust to handle the UI for both the Turnstile widget and the Challenge page. This decision brought clear benefits in terms of safety and consistency across platforms, but it also increased frontend complexity. Many of us are used to the ergonomics of modern frameworks like React, where common UI interactions come almost for free. Working with Rust meant reimplementing even simple interactions using lower level constructs like <i>document.getElementById</i>, <i>createElement</i>, and <i>appendChild</i>.</p><p>On top of that, compile times and strict checks naturally slowed down rapid UI iteration compared to JavaScript based frameworks. Debugging was also more involved, as the tooling ecosystem is still evolving. These constraints pushed us to be more deliberate, more thoughtful, and ultimately more disciplined in how we approached UI development.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"small-visual-changes-big-global-impact\"><b>Small visual changes, big global impact</b></h4>\n      <a href=\"#small-visual-changes-big-global-impact\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-start-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>What initially looked like small visual tweaks such as padding adjustments or alignment changes quickly revealed a much bigger challenge: internationalization.</p><p>Once translations were available, we had to ensure that content remained readable and usable across 38 languages and 16 different UI states. Text length variability alone required careful design decisions. Some translations can be 30 to 300 percent longer than English. A short English string like “Stuck?” becomes “Tidak bisa melanjutkan?” in Indonesian or “Es geht nicht weiter?” in German, dramatically changing layout requirements.</p><p>Right-to-left language support added another layer of complexity. Supporting Arabic, Persian or Farsi, and Hebrew meant more than flipping text direction. Entire layouts had to be mirrored, including alignment, navigation patterns, directional icons, and animation flows. Many of these elements are implicitly designed with left-to-right assumptions, so we had to revisit those decisions and make them truly bidirectional.</p><p>Ordered lists also required special care. Not every culture uses the Western 1, 2, 3 numbering system, and hardcoding numeric sequences can make interfaces feel foreign or incorrect. We leaned on locale-aware numbering and fully translatable list formats to ensure ordering felt natural and culturally appropriate in every language.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"building-confidence-through-testing\"><b>Building confidence through testing</b></h4>\n      <a href=\"#building-confidence-through-testing\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-start-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>As we started listing action points in feedback reports, correctness became even more critical.

By unifying the architecture of Turnstile and Challenge Pages, we’ve built a foundation that allows us to iterate faster and protect the Internet more humanely than ever before.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n      <a href=\"#looking-ahead\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-start-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>This redesign is a foundation, not a finish line.</p><p>We&#39;re continuing to monitor how users interact with the new experience, and we&#39;re committed to iterating based on what we learn. The feedback mechanisms we&#39;ve built into the new design — the ones that actually help users troubleshoot, rather than just asking them to report problems — will give us richer insights than we&#39;ve ever had before.</p><p>We&#39;re also watching how the security landscape evolves. As bot attacks grow more sophisticated, and as AI continues to blur the line between human and automated behavior, the challenge of verification will only get harder. Our job is to stay ahead — to keep improving security without making the human experience worse.</p><p>If you encounter the new Turnstile or Challenge Pages and have feedback, we want to hear it. Reach out through our <a href=\"https://community.cloudflare.com/\"><u>community forums</u></a> or use the feedback mechanisms built into the experience itself.</p>",
