	<p>CloudFlare’s DNS server, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/rrdns/">RRDNS</a>, is entirely written in Go and typically runs tens of thousands goroutines. Since goroutines are cheap and Go I/O is blocking we run one goroutine per file descriptor we listen on and queue new packets for processing.</p>

	<p>When there are thousands of goroutines running, debug output quickly becomes difficult to interpret. For example, last week I was tracking down a problem with a file descriptor and wanted to know what its listening goroutine was doing. <em>With 40k stack traces, good luck figuring out which one is having trouble.</em></p>
	<p>Go stack traces include parameter values, but most Go types are (or are implemented as) pointers, so what you will see passed to the goroutine function is just a meaningless memory address.</p>
	<p>We have a couple options to make sense of the addresses: get a heap dump at the same time as the stack trace and cross-reference the pointers, or have a debug endpoint that prints a goroutine/pointer -&gt; IP map. Neither are seamless.</p>
	<h3 id="underscoretotherescue">Underscore to the rescue</h3>
	<p>However, we know that <em>integers are shown in traces</em>, so what we did is first <em>convert IPv4 addresses to their uint32 representation</em>:</p>
	<pre><code class="language-go">// addrToUint32 takes a TCPAddr or UDPAddr and converts its IP to a uint32.
// If the IP is v6, 0xffffffff is returned.
func addrToUint32(addr net.Addr) uint32 {
       var ip net.IP
       switch addr := addr.(type) {
       case *net.TCPAddr:
               ip = addr.IP
       case *net.UDPAddr:
               ip = addr.IP
       case *net.IPAddr:
               ip = addr.IP
       }
       if ip == nil {
               return 0
       }
       ipv4 := ip.To4()
       if ipv4 == nil {
               return math.MaxUint32
       }
       return uint32(ipv4[0])&lt;&lt;24 | uint32(ipv4[1])&lt;&lt;16 | uint32(ipv4[2])&lt;&lt;8 | uint32(ipv4[3])
}
</code></pre>
	<p>And then <em>pass the IPv4-as-uint32 to the listening goroutine as an <code>_</code> parameter</em>. Yes, as a parameter with name <code>_</code>; it's known as the <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Blank_identifier" target="_blank">blank identifier</a> in Go.</p>
	<pre><code class="language-go">// PacketUDPRead is a goroutine that listens on a specific UDP socket and reads
// in new requests
// The first parameter is the int representation of the listening IP address,
// and it's passed just so it will appear in stack traces
func PacketUDPRead(_ uint32, conn *net.UDPConn, ...) { ... }

go PacketUDPRead(addrToUint32(conn.LocalAddr()), conn, ...)
</code></pre>
	<p>Now when we get a stack trace, we can just look at the first bytes, convert them back to dotted notation, and know on what IP the goroutine was listening.</p>
	<pre><code>goroutine 42 [IO wait]:
	[...]
	/.../request.go:195 +0x5d
rrdns/core.PacketUDPRead(0xc27f000001, 0x2b6328113ad8, 0xc20801ecc0, 0xc208044308, 0xc208e99280, 0xc208ad8180, 0x12a05f200)
	/.../server.go:119 +0x35a
created by rrdns/core.PacketIO
	/.../server.go:230 +0x8be
</code></pre>
	<p><code>0xc27f000001</code> -&gt; remove alignment byte -&gt; <code>0x7f000001</code> -&gt; <code>127.0.0.1</code></p>
	<p>Obviously you can do the same with any piece of information you can represent as an <code>int</code>.</p>
