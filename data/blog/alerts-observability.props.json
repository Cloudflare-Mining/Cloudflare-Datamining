This is what a typical day for a lot of on-call personnel looks like. On-calls get a lot of alerts, and dealing with too many alerts can result in alert fatigue – a feeling of exhaustion caused by responding to alerts that lack priority or clear actions. Ensuring the alerts are actionable and accurate, not false positives, is crucial because repeated false alarms can desensitize on-call personnel. To this end, within Cloudflare, numerous teams conduct periodic alert analysis, with each team developing its own dashboards for reporting. As members of the Observability team, we&#39;ve encountered situations where teams reported inaccuracies in alerts or instances where alerts failed to trigger, as well as provided assistance in dealing with noisy/flapping alerts.</p><p>Observability aims to enhance insight into the technology stack by gathering and analyzing a broader spectrum of data. In this blog post, we delve into alert observability, discussing its importance and Cloudflare&#39;s approach to achieving it. We&#39;ll also explore how we overcome shortcomings in alert reporting within our architecture to simplify troubleshooting using open-source tools and best practices. Join us to understand how we use alerts effectively and use simple tools and practices to enhance our alerts observability, resilience, and on-call personnel health.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6qWK558VCZwC2jF5d2zaYJ/6046122acf14201640f4a8ae757d94b1/Screenshot-2024-01-18-at-10.52.33-PM.png\" alt=\"Alert fatigue\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"904\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Being on-call can disrupt sleep patterns, impact social life, and hinder leisure activities, potentially leading to burnout. While burnout can be caused by several factors, one contributing factor can be excessively noisy alerts or receiving alerts that are neither important nor actionable. Analyzing alerts can help mitigate the risk of such burnout by reducing unnecessary interruptions and improving the overall efficiency of the on-call process. It involves periodic review and feedback to the system for improving alert quality. Unfortunately, only some companies or teams do alert analysis, even though it is essential information that every on-call or manager should have access to.</p><p>Alert analysis is useful for on-call personnel, enabling them to easily see which alerts have fired during their shift to help draft handover notes and not miss anything important. In addition, managers can generate reports from these stats to see the improvements over time, as well as helping assess on-call vulnerability to burnout. Alert analysis also helps with writing incident reports, to see if alerts were fired, or to determine when an incident started.</p><p>Let’s first understand the alerting stack and how we used open-source tools to gain greater visibility into it, which allowed us to analyze and optimize its effectiveness.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"prometheus-architecture-at-cloudflare\">Prometheus architecture at Cloudflare</h3>\n            <a href=\"#prometheus-architecture-at-cloudflare\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/B78dhbx9vkOS1axZyxHtJ/32b86612925a465cd4b3220830dbcd27/Untitled-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1352\" height=\"1043\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>At Cloudflare, we <a href=\"/how-cloudflare-runs-prometheus-at-scale/\">rely heavily on Prometheus</a> for monitoring.

They return to the firing state when the silence expires or the inhibiting alert resolves, and eventually transition to the resolved state.</i></p><p>Alertmanager sends notifications for <code>firing</code> and <code>resolved</code> alert events via webhook integration. We were using <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/alertmanager2es\">alertmanager2es</a>, which receives webhook alert notifications from Alertmanager and inserts them into an Elasticsearch index for searching and analysis. Alertmanager2es has been a reliable tool for us over the years, offering ways to monitor alerting volume, noisy alerts and do some kind of alert reporting. However, it had its limitations. The absence of <code>silenced</code> and <code>inhibited</code> alert states made troubleshooting issues challenging. We often found ourselves guessing why an alert didn&#39;t trigger - was it silenced by another alert or perhaps inhibited by one? Without concrete data, we lacked the means to confirm what was truly happening.</p><p>Since the Alertmanager doesn’t provide notifications for <code>silenced</code> or <code>inhibited</code> alert events via webhook integration, the alert reporting we were doing was somewhat lacking or incomplete. However, the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus/alertmanager/master/api/v2/openapi.yaml\">Alertmanager API</a> provides querying capabilities and by querying the <code>/api/alerts</code> alertmanager endpoint, we can get the <code>silenced</code> and <code>inhibited</code> alert states. Having all four states in a datastore will enhance our ability to improve alert reporting and troubleshoot Alertmanager issues.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5QeyKMHibWHpSpAOJjHjSM/55e4385b5a8367feb29958062ebe2846/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-1.14.02-PM.png\" alt=\"Alertmanager alert notifications\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1222\" height=\"665\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Interfaces for providing information about alert states</i></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"solution\">Solution</h2>\n            <a href=\"#solution\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>We opted to aggregate all states of the alerts (firing, silenced, inhibited, and resolved) into a datastore.

Instead, we decided to create individual columns for a few common labels like alert priority, instance, dashboard, alert-ref, alertname, etc., which helps us analyze the data in general and keep all other labels in a column of type <code>Map(String, String)</code>. This was done because we wanted to keep all the labels in the datastore with minimal resource usage and allow users to query specific labels or filter alerts based on particular labels. For example, we can select all Prometheus alerts using  <code>labelsmap[‘service’’] = ‘Prometheus’</code>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"dashboards\">Dashboards</h2>\n            <a href=\"#dashboards\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/14NoQxvbOYttnGrlFmIR3Z/6d0299ffa240ba562da42ccb8a6e2ddd/Screenshot-2024-01-18-at-11.02.31-PM.png\" alt=\"Outcome\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"672\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We built multiple dashboards on top of this data:</p><ul><li><p><b>Alerts overview</b>: To get insights into all the alerts the Alertmanager receives.</p></li><li><p><b>Alertname overview</b>: To drill down on a specific alert.</p></li><li><p><b>Alerts overview by receiver:</b> This is similar to alerts overview but specific to a team or receiver.</p></li><li><p><b>Alerts state timeline</b>: This dashboard shows a snapshot of alert volume at a glance.</p></li><li><p><b>Jiralerts overview</b>: To get insights into the alerts the ticket system receives.</p></li><li><p><b>Silences overview</b>: To get insights into the Alertmanager silences.</p></li></ul>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"alerts-overview\">Alerts overview</h3>\n            <a href=\"#alerts-overview\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2pclX6PtvC0zJRhX4ibl9U/8125519c56fd4c7bd0f6286f7b374cda/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-1.14.24-PM.png\" alt=\"Collapsed alerts overview dashboard\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1217\" height=\"642\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The image is a screenshot of the collapsed alerts overview dashboard by receiver.

It displays the start time, active duration, and resolution of an alert. This highlighted alert is changing state too frequently from firing to resolved - this looks like a flapping alert. Flapping occurs when an alert changes state too frequently. This can happen when alerts are not configured properly and need tweaking, such as adjusting the alert threshold or increasing the <code>for duration</code> period in the alerting rule. The <code>for duration</code> field in the alerting rules adds time tolerance before an alert starts firing. In other words, the alert won’t fire unless the condition is met for ‘X’ minutes.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"findings\">Findings</h2>\n            <a href=\"#findings\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>There were a few interesting findings within our analysis.

We also discovered a lot of stale silences, where silence was created for a long duration and is not relevant anymore.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"diy-alert-analysis\">DIY Alert analysis</h2>\n            <a href=\"#diy-alert-analysis\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/tree/master/2024-03-alerts-observability\">The directory</a> contains a basic demo for implementing alerts observability.

It&#39;s crucial for us to have visibility to detect and address system misuse, ensuring proper alerting. The use of alert analysis tools has significantly enhanced the experience for on-call personnel and our team, offering swift access to the alert system. Alerts observability has facilitated the troubleshooting of events such as why an alert did not fire, why an inhibited alert fired, or which alert silenced / inhibited another alert, providing valuable insights for improving alert management.</p><p>Moreover, alerts overview dashboards facilitate rapid review and adjustment, streamlining operations. Teams use these dashboards in the weekly alert reviews to provide tangible evidence of how an on-call shift went, identify which alerts fire most frequently, becoming candidates for cleanup or aggregation thus curbing system misuse and bolstering overall alert management. Additionally, we can pinpoint services that may require particular attention. Alerts observability has also empowered some teams to make informed decisions about on-call configurations, such as transitioning to longer but less frequent shifts or integrating on-call and unplanned work shifts.</p><p>In conclusion, alert observability plays a crucial role in averting burnout by minimizing interruptions and enhancing on-call duties&#39; efficiency. Offering alerts observability as a service benefits all teams by obviating the need for individual dashboard development and fostering a proactive monitoring culture.If you found this blog post interesting and want to work on observability, please check out our job openings – we’re hiring for <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/careers/jobs/?department=Production+Engineering&title=alerting\">Alerting</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/careers/jobs/?department=Production+Engineering&title=logging\">Logging</a>!</p>",
