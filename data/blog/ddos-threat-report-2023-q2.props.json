DDoS attacks, or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\">distributed denial-of-service attacks</a>, are a type of cyber attack that aims to disrupt websites (and other types of Internet properties) to make them unavailable for legitimate users by overwhelming them with more traffic than they can handle — similar to a driver stuck in a traffic jam on the way to the grocery store.</p><p>We see a lot of DDoS attacks of all types and sizes and our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">network</a> is one of the largest in the world spanning more than 300 cities in over 100 countries. Through this network we serve over 63 million HTTP requests per second at peak and over 2 trillion DNS queries every day. This colossal amount of data gives us a unique vantage point to provide the community access to insightful DDoS trends.</p><p>For our regular readers, you might notice a change in the layout of this report. We used to follow a set pattern to share our insights and trends about DDoS attacks. But with the landscape of DDoS threats changing as DDoS attacks have become more powerful and sophisticated, we felt it&#39;s time for a change in how we present our findings. So, we&#39;ll kick things off with a quick global overview, and then dig into the major shifts we&#39;re seeing in the world of DDoS attacks.</p><p><i>Reminder: an interactive version of this report is also available on </i><a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/ddos-2023-q2\"><i>Cloudflare Radar</i></a><i>.

DNS helps translate the human-friendly website address (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com\">www.cloudflare.com</a>) to a machine-friendly IP address (e.g. 104.16.124.96). By disrupting DNS servers, attackers impact the machines’ ability to connect to a website, and by doing so making websites unavailable to users.</p><p>Over the past quarter, the most common attack vector was <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-flood-ddos-attack/\">DNS-based DDoS attacks</a> — 32% of all DDoS attacks were over the DNS protocol. Amongst these, one of the more concerning attack types we’ve seen increasing is the <i>DNS Laundering attack</i> which can pose severe challenges to organizations that operate their own <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-server-types/#:~:text=What%20is%20an%20authoritative%20nameserver%3F\">authoritative DNS servers</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4suDM0V6shZ1D6QXG8HgJx/c7813fe912384694ebb8239e2b5348d3/pasted-image-0--4-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"881\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Top DDoS attack vectors in 2023 Q2</p><p>The term “Laundering” in the DNS Laundering attack name refers to the analogy of money laundering, the devious process of making illegally-gained proceeds, often referred to as &quot;dirty money,&quot; appear legal. Similarly, in the DDoS world, a DNS Laundering attack is the process of making bad, malicious traffic appear as good, legitimate traffic by laundering it via reputable <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-server-types/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20DNS%20recursive%20resolver%3F\">recursive DNS resolvers</a>.</p><p>In a DNS Laundering attack, the threat actor will query subdomains of a domain that is managed by the victim’s DNS server. The prefix that defines the subdomain is randomized and is never used more than once or twice in such an attack. Due to the randomization element, recursive DNS servers will never have a cached response and will need to forward the query to the victim’s authoritative DNS server. The authoritative DNS server is then bombarded by so many queries until it cannot serve legitimate queries or even crashes all together.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/35ih4bBRoWVOjaBul8pM3u/f415b410247eab186b6779be93f8980d/DNS-Laundering-attack.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"889\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Illustration of a DNS Laundering DDoS attack</p><p>From the protection point of view, the DNS administrators can’t block the attack source because the source includes reputable recursive DNS servers like Google’s 8.8.8.8 and Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1.

And even the largest and most sophisticated attacks that we’ve seen may only last a few minutes or even seconds — which doesn’t give a human sufficient time to respond. Before the PagerDuty alert is even sent, the attack may be over and the damage is done. Recovering from a DDoS attack can last much longer than the attack itself — just as a boxer might need a while to recover from a punch to the face that only lasts a fraction of a second.</p><p>Security is not one single product or a click of a button, but rather a process involving multiple layers of defense to reduce the risk of impact.

That is because at that layer, IP addresses cannot be <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing/\">spoofed</a> (i.e., altered). However, at the network layer, source IP addresses can be spoofed. So, instead of relying on IP addresses to understand the source, we instead use the location of our data centers where the attack packets were ingested. We’re able to get geographical accuracy due to our large global coverage in over 285 locations around the world.</p><p><b>Target country</b>For both application-layer and network-layer DDoS attacks, we group attacks and traffic by our customers’ billing country. This lets us understand which countries are subject to more attacks.</p><p><b>Target industry</b>For both application-layer and network-layer DDoS attacks, we group attacks and traffic by our customers’ industry according to our customer relations management system. This lets us understand which industries are subject to more attacks.</p><p><b>Total volume vs. percentage</b>For both source and target insights, we look at the total volume of attack traffic compared to all traffic as one data point. Additionally, we also look at the percentage of attack traffic towards or from a specific country, to a specific country or to a specific industry. This gives us an “attack activity rate” for a given country/industry which is normalized by their total traffic levels. This helps us remove biases of a country or industry that normally receives a lot of traffic and therefore a lot of attack traffic as well.</p><p><b>How we calculate attack characteristics</b>To calculate the attack size, duration, attack vectors and emerging threats, we bucket attacks and then provide the share of each bucket out of the total amount for each dimension. On the new Radar component, these trends are calculated by number of bytes instead.  Since attacks may vary greatly in number of bytes from one another, this could lead to trends differing between the reports and the Radar component.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"general-disclaimer-and-clarification\">General disclaimer and clarification</h3>\n      <a href=\"#general-disclaimer-and-clarification\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>When we describe ‘top countries’ as the source or target of attacks, it does not necessarily mean that that country was attacked as a country, but rather that organizations that use that country as their billing country were targeted by attacks. Similarly, attacks originating from a country does not mean that that country launched the attacks, but rather that the attack was launched from IP addresses that have been mapped to that country. Threat actors operate global botnets with nodes all over the world, and in many cases also use Virtual Private Networks and proxies to obfuscate their true location. So if anything, the source country could indicate the presence of exit nodes or botnet nodes within that country.</p>",
