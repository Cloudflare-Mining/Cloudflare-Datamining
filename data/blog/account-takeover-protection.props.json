This works sadly often because <a href=\"https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2014/programme/tangled-web-password-reuse/\">more than 50% of users reuse the same password for multiple accounts</a> - and the result is a large number of breached accounts. Your own end user account security therefore relies not only on the security of your own systems, but on the security of all other systems used by your users. And while multi-factor authentication can provide defense-in-depth, many authentication services and users don’t yet employ it and, even so, we’d like to be able to warn services and their users when a username/password pair is vulnerable.</p><p>In addition to other approaches like bot detection, a new best practice in industry is for login services to themselves check if one of their user’s credentials is in a known data breach. This requires having a good set of known breached username/password pairs. Services like <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned</a> and <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2020/10/new-password-protections-and-more-in.html\">Google’s Password Breach Alerting</a> aggregate large databases of known-breached username/password pairs, and allow companies or end users to do a lookup to determine vulnerability. But integration can be challenging, and ideally organizations would be able to turn on credential checking protection with the push of a button.</p><p>We’re doing just that. Today, we’re launching a new feature of the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/\">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a>: Exposed Credential Checks.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/66j38PwRNdbCoYCSOFWUHN/8874ea47a29ac5ce764da4dd8b3d5dd1/Screenshot-2021-03-29-at-21.23.51.png\" alt=\"Exposed Credential Checks can be easily enabled with our Managed Ruleset. Alternatively, you can write your own custom rules.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1328\" height=\"852\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Exposed Credential Checks can be easily enabled with our Managed Ruleset. Alternatively, you can write your own custom rules.‌‌</p><p>Login requests for any application protected by Cloudflare are routed through the WAF, and this provides the opportunity for an “on-path” exposed credential check. When enabled, on any authentication attempt, the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">WAF</a> will automatically check end user credentials against a database of leaked credentials gathered and maintained by Cloudflare. In the event that a match is found, the WAF will add a header to the origin, so that your application can be warned about a vulnerable credential and, for example, trigger a password reset flow for that user or a second factor authentication challenge.</p><p>Handling usernames and passwords is, to say the least, highly sensitive and we’ve architected the exposed credential check feature to protect user credentials. A key design principle was that the username/password pair should never be exposed outside the boundaries of the WAF process, thereby ensuring we can perform the check without adding any additional risk. That means the feature never transmits usernames or passwords outside the WAF process or logs them<sup>1</sup> as we have no interest in knowing what any of these credentials are -- only if they pose a risk to the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/\">security of your network</a>. But even beyond that we have built a privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol to perform the database look-up. Roughly speaking, we apply a keyed cryptographic hash function to the username/password pair within the WAF process and check whether the resulting hash value matches keyed hashes of pairs from our database of known breached credentials. We will explain this further in a follow up technical deep dive.</p><p>Starting today, Enterprise customers can request access to this feature by contacting our team on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/exposed-credential-checks/\">this page</a>. Exposed credential checks are provided both as a managed ruleset, that will work “out of the box” for common systems such as WordPress, Joomla and others, and as a filter for custom rules so that any application can be supported.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"cloudflare-access-with-managed-devices\">Cloudflare Access with Managed Devices</h3>\n      <a href=\"#cloudflare-access-with-managed-devices\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>With <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/access/\">Cloudflare Access</a> you can provide an additional authentication layer in front of any application protected by Cloudflare. Access protects applications by verifying user identity, location and network on every request. This naturally increases security for the end user account.</p><p>The device the user is using may, however, still not be secure. A valid authentication session with a compromised device may lead to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-data-exfiltration/\">data exfiltration</a>, or worse, total compromise of the end user account or application. Enterprises try to reduce this risk by managing and issuing corporate devices where security policies can be enforced via mobile device management (MDM) solutions.</p><p>To solve this problem, we are improving Cloudflare Access to enforce that only corporate devices access sensitive applications. Via access rules, it is now possible to verify a device’s serial number against a list of managed devices before allowing access. Even if a user’s credentials were to be exposed, any unauthorized access would be blocked due the device having a serial number outside the list of managed devices.
