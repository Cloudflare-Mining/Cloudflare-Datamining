	<p>Along with four other <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> colleagues, I traveled to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+Haven,+CT/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e7d8443a8070e5:0xf6a354c659b264ed?sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTlOyDlfvXAhVH8GMKHc4xB1AQ8gEImAEwDg">New Haven, CT</a> last weekend to support 1,000+ college students from Yale and beyond at <a href="https://www.yhack.org">YHack</a> hackathon.</p>
	<p>Throughout the weekend-long event, student attendees were supported by mentors, workshops, entertaining performances, tons of food and caffeine breaks, and a lot of air-mattresses and sleeping bags. Their purpose was to create projects to solve real world problems and to learn and have fun in the process.</p>

	<p>Cloudflare sponsored YHack. Our team of five wanted to support, educate, and positively impact the experience and learning of these college students. Here are some ways we engaged with students.</p>

			<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2hL6LsEAzD8LWtp8zarSG9/c4039c4df953386c2174435cc6d3031c/Screen-Shot-2017-12-08-at-11.55.59-AM.png" alt="Cloudflare Mentor Team" class="kg-image" width="1704" height="1232" loading="lazy">
		</a>
	</figure>
	<h6>1. Mentoring</h6>
	<p>Our team of five mentors from three different teams and two different Cloudflare locations (San Francisco and Austin) was available at the Cloudflare table or via Slack for almost every hour of the event. There were a few hours in the early morning when all of us were asleep, I'm sure, but we were available to help otherwise.</p>
	<h6>2. Providing challenges</h6>
	<p>Cloudflare submitted two challenges to the student attendees, encouraging them to protect and improve the performance of their projects and/or create an opportunity for exposure to 6 million+ potential users of their apps.</p>
	<p><b>Challenge 1</b>: Put Cloudflare in front of your hackathon project</p>
	<p><b>Challenge 2</b>. Make a Cloudflare App</p>
	<p>Prizes were awarded to all teams which completed these challenges. Cloudflare awarded a total of ten teams for completing the challenges. The team which was judged to have created the best Cloudflare app won free admission to Cloudflare's 2018 <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/internet-summit">Internet Summit</a> as well as several swag items and introductions to Cloudflare teams offering internships next summer.</p>
	<h6>3. Distributing swag &amp; cookies</h6>
	<p>Over 3,000 swag items (t-shirts, laptop stickers, and laptop camera covers) were distributed to almost every attendee. When the Cloudflare team noticed student attendees were going without snacks after dinner, I made a trip to a local grocery store and bought hundreds of cookies to distribute as well. After about an hour, none remained.</p>

	</figure>
	<h6>4. Sponsoring</h6>
	<p>As with most any hackathon, costs for food, A/V, venue rental, and other expenses are considerable. Cloudflare decided to financially support YHack to help offset some of these costs and be sure student participants were able to attend, learn, and build meaningful projects without having to pay admission fees.</p>

	<p>In groups of up to four, students teamed up to create projects. There was no set project theme, so students could focus on subject areas they were most passionate about. Judging criteria were "practical and useful", "polish", "technical difficulty", and "creativity" and several sponsors, such as <a href="https://www.intuit.com">Intuit</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, <a href="https://www.jetblue.com">JetBlue</a>, and Yale's <a href="https://communications.yale.edu/poynter">Poynter Fellowship in Journalism</a> submitted suggested challenges for teams to work on.</p>
	<p>I saw a lot of cool projects that could help college students save money on food or other expenses, projects that could help identify fake news sources, and apps that would work great on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps">Cloudflare Apps</a>.</p>
	<p>There were dozens of great completed projects by the end of the Hackathon. I'd like to highlight a few great ones which used Cloudflare best.</p>

	<p>"Smart Bitcoin Investing Chatbot"</p>
	<p>When the Facebook messenger chatbot is asked when it is best to invest in Bitcoin, current market trends are observed and a Mad Invest's model predicts how likely it is for the price to go up or down. A conclusion as to when it would be a good time to invest or sell is drawn and delivered by message to users.</p>
	<p>Moving forward, the team intends to improve their model's predictions by developing a way to analyze the Chinese market, which represents 70% of Bitcoin traffic.</p>
	<p>When telling me about their experience using Cloudflare and how it saved them time, the team delivered my favorite quote from the whole weekend. “We spent half an hour setting up Let's Encrypt for the SSL and we realized we could just put Cloudflare in front of it.” Exactly.</p>

	<p>I was honored to be part of a team that supported so many awesome students in the development of their projects at YHack. I was pleased to hear many attendees had already heard of or used Cloudflare before and many teams interacted with Cloudflare to protect and improve the performance of their projects and develop new apps. I look forward to being involved many more events in 2018 as well.</p>
