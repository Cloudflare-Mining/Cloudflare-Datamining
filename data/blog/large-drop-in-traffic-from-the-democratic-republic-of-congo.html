	<p>It is not uncommon for countries around the world to interrupt Internet access for political reasons or because of social unrest. We've seen this many times in the past (e.g. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unrest-in-gabon-leads-to-internet-shutdown/">Gabon</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/syrian-internet-access-appears-partially-rees/">Syria</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-story-of-two-outages/">Togo</a>).</p>
	<p>Today, it appears that Internet access in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been greatly curtailed. The BBC reports that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-42766151" target="_blank">Internet access in the capital, Kinshasa was cut on Saturday</a> and iAfrikan reports that <a href="https://www.iafrikan.com/2018/01/22/internet-accesss-blocked-in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-drc/" target="_blank">the cut is because of anti-Kabila protests</a>.</p>
	<p>Our monitoring of traffic from the Democratic Republic of Congo shows a distinct drop off starting around midnight UTC on January 21, 2018. Traffic is down to about 1/3 of its usual level.</p>

	<p>We'll update this blog once we have more information about traffic levels.</p>
	<p><strong>Update January 24, 2018</strong></p>
	<p>Internet access in the Democratic Republic of Congo looks to have been restored with traffic returning to typical levels after roughly three days of disruption.</p>
