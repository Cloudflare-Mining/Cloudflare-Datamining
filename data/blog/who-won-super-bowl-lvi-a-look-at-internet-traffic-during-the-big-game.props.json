So, let’s start with the aggregated traffic to a set of food delivery services that clearly builds to a peak around 17:30, one hour before kickoff. After that, traffic generally decreases but increases slightly after the second half starts.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1zUHz5Hz06wU6cIrreS5CN/337a4d4c816619c342ab6aaa7661fac7/image6-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1186\" height=\"606\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When we look at traffic to <b>sports websites</b>, there’s a build up to a peak as the game began at 18:30.</p><p>As the game progressed, traffic dropped off, but spiked three times during halftime (between 20:00 and 20:30). After the Rams victory was assured, traffic to those websites saw a final peak.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5wVZdIfjGwsn7zsmBH2SbP/70b9d3fa209e5e923b76f5400a963a90/image8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1186\" height=\"606\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We can also see below that aggregated traffic to <b>video platforms</b> had a pattern similar to sports websites, with two peaks at halftime and a third notable one at the end of the game. After kickoff (18:30) the first peak occurred around the same time Coinbase’s bouncing QR code commercial aired.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5dyAwv4ZOwFVljSyUGvdVu/f2aad5564a21060376c3c88b74487f6c/image7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1186\" height=\"606\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>How about <b>social media</b>? Aggregate traffic to social media sites started to decrease after 17:00, hitting its lowest point just before kickoff.</p><p>During the game, there was a clear spike (the biggest of the afternoon/evening) after the Coinbase QR code ad aired. At halftime, social media traffic dropped off before peaking again right before the second half started. A final peak occurred after the game ended.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4OrOXPCcz7XvqcWD3dlMIY/b69dd18302b4d517fd64b8fb61c78e1f/image2-12.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1186\" height=\"606\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Finally, let’s look at <b>messaging services</b>. Among this set of domains, there wasn’t as much of a decrease as we saw in social media heading into kickoff, but there was a spike around 19:00 after the second batch of commercials was aired. Traffic continued to grow through halftime and into the third quarter before starting to drop heading towards the end of the game. Similar to several of the other categories above, messaging traffic again rose after the end of the game.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6xwTRCzy860dBVDqBuZFlz/1400e4f7710da20614108b81b48ea8d5/image20-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1186\" height=\"606\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-internet-impact-of-commercials\">The Internet Impact of Commercials</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-internet-impact-of-commercials\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Historically, many people have watched the Super Bowl as much for the ads as the actual football game. (Maybe even more so some years…) Many of the advertisements are now posted online ahead of Super Bowl Sunday. Given that, do these commercials still drive traffic to the company’s web site while the game is on?” As we saw in <a href=\"/who-won-super-bowl-lv/\">2021</a>, the answer remains a resounding yes.</p><p>The first <a href=\"https://www.budlight.com/\">Bud Light</a> ad during the game (at 18:52) drove a more than 25x increase to their site, and the Bud Light Seltzer Hard Soda ad with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs0YHD0JoCk\">Guy Fieri</a> at 21:00 drove a second peak in traffic, with a 15x increase over baseline.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/65yR5nWltoVtvLzKwcCdvf/782f5cf109a1a97f368199080cde075c/image11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1186\" height=\"606\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The Pringles <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjZ_O-c3QRw\">commercial</a> (at 21:00), where a hand stuck in a Pringles can really stuck with viewers, resulted in a greater than 35x increase. On the other hand, Lays got a 30x bump in traffic from their wedding memories ad at 20:53.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5zJ5mA6dBd7QJ6TD5JBUZH/f617456edf2828e15bde9b506539a4b9/image3-16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1186\" height=\"606\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The Doritos website had already experienced some spikes throughout the afternoon, but jungle animals singing the Salt-N-Pepa hit &#39;Push It&#39;  (19:13) drove a more than 12x increase in traffic.
