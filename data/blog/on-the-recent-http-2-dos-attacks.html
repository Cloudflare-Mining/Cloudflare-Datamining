	<p>Today, multiple Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities were disclosed for a number of HTTP/2 server implementations. Cloudflare uses NGINX for HTTP/2. <b>Customers using Cloudflare are already protected against these attacks.</b></p>
	<p>The individual vulnerabilities, originally discovered by Netflix and are included in <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-002.md">this</a> announcement are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>

		</li>
		<li>
			<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9512">CVE-2019-9512</a> HTTP/2 Ping Flood</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9513">CVE-2019-9513</a> HTTP/2 Resource Loop</p>

	</ul>
	<p>As soon as we became aware of these vulnerabilities, Cloudflareâ€™s Protocols team started working on fixing them. We first pushed a patch to detect any attack attempts and to see if any normal traffic would be affected by our mitigations. This was followed up with work to mitigate these vulnerabilities; we pushed the changes out few weeks ago and continue to monitor similar attacks on our stack.</p>
	<p>If any of our customers host web services over HTTP/2 on an alternative, publicly accessible path that is not behind Cloudflare, we recommend you apply the latest security updates to your origin servers in order to protect yourselves from these HTTP/2 vulnerabilities.</p>
	<p>We will soon follow up with more details on these vulnerabilities and how we mitigated them.</p>
	<p>Full credit for the discovery of these vulnerabilities goes to Jonathan Looney of Netflix and Piotr Sikora of Google and the Envoy Security Team.</p>
