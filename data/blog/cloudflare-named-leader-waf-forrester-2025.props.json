We leverage AI and machine learning to detect threats such as attacks, automated traffic, anomalies, and compromised JavaScript, among others. Our industry-leading application-layer DDoS protection makes volumetric attacks a thing of the past.</p><p>Second, Cloudflare has also made significant strides in <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/\"><u>API security</u></a>. Our WAF can be supercharged with features such as: API discovery, schema validation &amp; sequence mitigation, volumetric detection, and JWT authentication. </p><p>Third, Cloudflare simplifies security management with an intuitive dashboard that is easy to use while still offering powerful configurations for advanced practitioners. All features are Terraform-supported, allowing teams to manage the entire Cloudflare platform as code. With Security Analytics, customers gain a comprehensive view of all traffic, whether mitigated or not, and can run what-if scenarios to test new rules before deployment. This analytic capability ensures that businesses can dynamically adapt their security posture while maintaining high performance. To make security management even more seamless, our AI agent, powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), helps users craft and refine custom rules and create powerful visualizations within our analytics engine.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"cloudflare-the-clear-choice-for-modern-security\">Cloudflare: the clear choice for modern security</h3>\n            <a href=\"#cloudflare-the-clear-choice-for-modern-security\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>We are confident that Forrester’s report validates what our customers already know: Cloudflare is a leading WAF vendor, offering unmatched security, innovation, and ease of use.
