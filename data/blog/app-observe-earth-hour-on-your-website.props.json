But &#x2014; just in case &#x2014; I mentioned the alpha version of our developer platform.  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/C19H34O2\">Katie G.</a>, a developer in the UK, warned that she was busy with lots of work and other projects, but ended with:<br><br>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'll still try to do it though in time for Earth Hour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<h3 id=\"underpromiseoverdeliver\">Underpromise, Overdeliver</h3>\n<p>Last night — about 48 hours later — <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/earthhour\">Earth Hour</a> was made available to all CloudFlare customers as a free CloudFlare app!</p>\n<p>Turn on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/earthhour\">the app</a>, and for one hour on March 31 (today, for some; tomorrow for many) your site will go dark and present a message to the site visitor explaining <a href=\"http://www.earthhour.org/\">Earth Hour</a>. The app offers site owners the chance to &quot;Save the world, 60 minutes every 365 days at a time.&quot;</p>\n<p>We applaud Katie for her quick work, and her questions during development have helped us improve the platform already.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatcanyoudooncloudflare\">What Can You Do On CloudFlare?</h3>\n<p>More info coming soon about this developer platform. But the impatient can follow links in this <a href=\"http://support.cloudflare.com/discussions/suggestions/1168-earth-hour\">thread</a>. If you'd like to develop an app, <a href=\"http://support.cloudflare.com/discussion/new\">let us know</a>. Developers can build globally-deployable apps for CloudFlare-powered sites, with no operation costs, to join the existing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps\">CloudFlare apps</a>. That's just the beginning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dontforget\">Don't Forget</h3>\n<p>It's easy to observe <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/earthhour\">Earth Hour</a>, no matter your time zone.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
