	<p>In this evaluation, Forrester analyzed 10 Email Security vendors across 27 different criteria. Cloudflare received the highest scores possible in nine key evaluation criteria, and also scored among the top three in the current offering category. We believe this recognition is due to our ability to deliver stronger security outcomes across email and collaboration tools. These highlights showcase the strength and maturity of our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security"><u>Email Security</u></a> solution:</p>
	<h4><b>Antimalware &amp; sandboxing</b></h4>
	<p>Cloudflare’s advanced sandboxing engine analyzes files, whether directly attached or linked via cloud storage, using both static and dynamic analysis. Our AI-powered detectors evaluate attachment structure and behavior in real time, enabling protection not only against known malware but also emerging threats.</p>
	<h4><b>Malicious URL detection &amp; web security</b></h4>
	<p>URLs are analyzed at delivery and again at click-time using Cloudflare’s global network. Our OCR and machine learning models extract and analyze metadata and page behavior to determine the maliciousness of a URL. Customers can also isolate suspicious links in remote browser sessions preventing user compromise. We continuously monitor URLs and retroactively remediate messages if the risk changes.</p>
	<h4><b>Threat intelligence</b></h4>
	<p>With over 4.4 trillion signals ingested daily across DNS, HTTP, and email layers, Cloudflare operates one of the most comprehensive real-time threat intelligence ecosystems. Campaigns observed via our DNS or HTTP layers are used to preemptively block related email threats well before traditional feeds.</p>
	<h4><b>Content analysis &amp; processing</b></h4>
	<p>Cloudflare uses an ensemble of large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and machine learning (ML) classifiers to analyze message tone, thread behavior, QR codes, and invoice language. These models detect indicators of fraud, business email compromise (BEC), and social engineering that legacy engines often miss.</p>
	<h4><b>Reporting &amp; dashboards</b></h4>
	<p>Cloudflare’s unified Zero Trust dashboard gives SOC teams full visibility across email, web, cloud, data events. Analysts can pivot across user activity in just a few clicks and export data when needed.&nbsp;</p>
	<h4><b>User quarantine</b></h4>
	<p>Our quarantine workflow is designed to minimize disruption. Customers can choose several ways to get notifications to users about messages that have been quarantined.&nbsp;</p>
	<h4><b>Email authentication</b></h4>
	<p>Cloudflare enforces <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/glossary/#authentication-methods"><u>SPF, DKIM, and DMARC</u></a> alignment automatically. We also offer a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/dmarc-management"><u>free DMARC reporting tool </u></a>that gives customers visibility into email authentication failures and helps them take control of email brand protection.</p>
	<h4><b>Product security</b></h4>
	<p>Security is core to Cloudflare’s DNA. All services undergo continuous penetration testing, adhere to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/compliance-resources"><u>SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 standards</u></a>, and operate on Cloudflare’s own infrastructure.</p>
	<h4><b>Partner ecosystem</b></h4>
	<p>Cloudflare integrates natively with Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, Palo Alto XSOAR, and ServiceNow, making it easy to bring Cloudflare Email Security into existing SOC workflows. We also partner with leading human risk and awareness platforms to give organizations a more user-centric view of risk and behavior.</p>
	<p>These strengths reflect Cloudflare’s commitment to building a comprehensive email security platform, one that’s designed to protect email inboxes and workspaces.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>We agree with Forrester’s perspective on where the email security market is headed. Across our customer base, from Fortune 100 enterprises to fast-growing startups, we’ve seen a clear evolution:</p>
	<p><b><i><u>Phishing is no longer confined to the inbox.</u></i></b></p>
	<p>Attackers are increasingly luring users into external apps, unaudited chat platforms, or legitimate third-party services, bypassing traditional security controls. This shift is forcing SOC teams to think beyond just email and adopt a more holistic approach to workspace security.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare was one of the first vendors to position email security as part of a broader <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products"><u>SASE and Zero Trust</u></a> strategy, securing not just messages, but the entire user surface. Looking ahead, we’re doubling down on this integrated vision of workspace security to give SOC teams simpler investigations and faster response.</p>

	<p>We will continue to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><b>Build AI-driven automation
				</b>Reduce alert fatigue and manual triage by using LLMs to summarize incidents, auto-label threats, and recommend next steps, allowing junior analysts to act with senior-level confidence.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Deepen integrations across the Cloudflare ecosystem
				</b>Continue to unify signals across email, web, cloud, and data to give security teams a single view of user behavior driving faster remediations.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Enhance real-time user coaching
				</b>Deliver contextual guidance at the moment of risk, whether via banners, isolation flows, or in-app warnings, to help users make safer and more informed decisions.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Develop best-in-class detections
				</b>Continue investing in advanced models detecting new and novel phishing campaigns by leveraging global telemetry from our network edge to stop novel threats faster.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Cloudflare has always approached email security not as a standalone point solution, but as a core pillar of unified threat protection, deeply integrated across the modern enterprise security stack.</p>
