Our engineers are looking at hundreds of parameters of our traffic, making sure that we get better all the time.</p><p>One of the core numbers we keep a close eye on is HTTP request latency, which is important for many of our products. We regard latency spikes as bugs to be fixed. One example is the 2017 story of <a href=\"/the-sad-state-of-linux-socket-balancing/\">&quot;Why does one NGINX worker take all the load?&quot;</a>, where we optimized our TCP Accept queues to improve overall latency of TCP sockets waiting for accept().</p><p>Performance tuning is a holistic endeavor, and we monitor and continuously improve a range of other performance metrics as well, including throughput. Sometimes, tradeoffs have to be made. Such a case occurred in 2015, when a latency spike was discovered in our processing of HTTP requests. The solution at the time was to set tcp_rmem to 4 MiB, which minimizes the amount of time the kernel spends on TCP collapse processing. It was this collapse processing that was causing the latency spikes. Later in this post we discuss TCP collapse processing in more detail.</p><p>The tradeoff is that using a low value for tcp_rmem limits TCP throughput over high latency links. The following graph shows the maximum throughput as a function of network latency for a window size of 2 MiB. Note that the 2 MiB corresponds to a tcp_rmem value of 4 MiB due to the tcp_adv_win_scale setting in effect at the time.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1mRCX3pD7U0Yzn1QeHDDhL/cef49d60e7e32c23d364cbbc65dd50e7/image10-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"787\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>For the Cloudflare products then in existence, this was not a major problem, as connections terminate and content is served from nearby servers due to our BGP anycast routing.</p><p>Since then, we have added new products, such as Magic WAN, WARP, Spectrum, Gateway, and others. These represent new types of use cases and traffic flows.</p><p>For example, imagine you&#39;re a typical Magic WAN customer. You have connected all of your worldwide offices together using the Cloudflare global network. While Time to First Byte still matters, Magic WAN office-to-office traffic also needs good throughput. For example, a lot of traffic over these corporate connections will be file sharing using protocols such as SMB. These are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_flow\">elephant flows</a> over <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1072\">long fat networks</a>. Throughput is the metric every eyeball watches as they are downloading files.</p><p>We need to continue to provide world-class low latency while simultaneously providing high throughput over high-latency connections.</p><p>Before we begin, let’s introduce the players in our game.</p><p><b>TCP receive window</b> is the maximum number of unacknowledged user payload bytes the sender should transmit (bytes-in-flight) at any point in time. The size of the receive window can and does go up and down during the course of a TCP session. It is a mechanism whereby the receiver can tell the sender to stop sending if the sent packets cannot be successfully received because the receive buffers are full. It is this receive window that often limits throughput over high-latency networks.</p><p><b>net.ipv4.tcp_adv_win_scale</b> is a (non-intuitive) number used to account for the overhead needed by Linux to process packets. The receive window is specified in terms of user payload bytes. Linux needs additional memory beyond that to track other data associated with packets it is processing.</p><p>The value of the receive window changes during the lifetime of a TCP session, depending on a number of factors. The maximum value that the receive window can be is limited by the amount of free memory available in the receive buffer, according to this table:</p><p>tcp_adv_win_scale</p><p>TCP window size</p><p>4</p><p>15/16 * available memory in receive buffer</p><p>3</p><p>⅞ * available memory in receive buffer</p><p>2</p><p>¾ * available memory in receive buffer</p><p>1</p><p>½ * available memory in receive buffer</p><p>0</p><p>available memory in receive buffer</p><p>-1</p><p>½ * available memory in receive buffer</p><p>-2</p><p>¼ * available memory in receive buffer</p><p>-3</p><p>⅛ * available memory in receive buffer</p><p>We can intuitively (and correctly) understand that the amount of available memory in the receive buffer is the difference between the used memory and the maximum limit. But what is the maximum size a receive buffer can be? The answer is sk_rcvbuf.</p><p><b>sk_rcvbuf</b> is a per-socket field that specifies the maximum amount of memory that a receive buffer can allocate. This can be set programmatically with the socket option SO_RCVBUF. This can sometimes be useful to do, for localhost TCP sessions, for example, but in general the use of SO_RCVBUF is not recommended.</p><p>So how is sk_rcvbuf set? The most appropriate value for that depends on the latency of the TCP session and other factors. This makes it difficult for L7 applications to know how to set these values correctly, as they will be different for every TCP session. The solution to this problem is Linux autotuning.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"linux-autotuning\">Linux autotuning</h2>\n            <a href=\"#linux-autotuning\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Linux autotuning is logic in the Linux kernel that adjusts the buffer size limits and the receive window based on actual packet processing. It takes into consideration a number of things including TCP session <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/round-trip-time-rtt/\">RTT</a>, L7 read rates, and the amount of available host memory.</p><p>Autotuning can sometimes seem mysterious, but it is actually fairly straightforward.</p><p>The central idea is that Linux can track the rate at which the local application is reading data off of the receive queue. It also knows the session RTT. Because Linux knows these things, it can automatically increase the buffers and receive window until it reaches the point at which the application layer or network bottleneck links are the constraint on throughput (and not host buffer settings). At the same time, autotuning prevents slow local readers from having excessively large receive queues. The way autotuning does that is by limiting the receive window and its corresponding receive buffer to an appropriate size for each socket.</p><p>The values set by autotuning can be seen via the Linux “<code>ss</code>” command from the <code>iproute</code> package (e.g. “<code>ss -tmi</code>”).  The relevant output fields from that command are:</p><p><b>Recv-Q</b> is the number of user payload bytes not yet read by the local application.</p><p><b>rcv_ssthresh</b> is the window clamp, a.k.a. the maximum receive window size. This value is not known to the sender. The sender receives only the current window size, via the TCP header field. A closely-related field in the kernel, tp-&gt;window_clamp, is the maximum window size allowable based on the amount of available memory. rcv_ssthresh is the receiver-side slow-start threshold value.</p><p><b>skmem_r</b> is the actual amount of memory that is allocated, which includes not only user payload (Recv-Q) but also additional memory needed by Linux to process the packet (packet metadata). This is known within the kernel as sk_rmem_alloc.</p><p>Note that there are other buffers associated with a socket, so skmem_r does not represent the total memory that a socket might have allocated. Those other buffers are not involved in the issues presented in this post.</p><p><b>skmem_rb</b> is the maximum amount of memory that could be allocated by the socket for the receive buffer. This is higher than rcv_ssthresh to account for memory needed for packet processing that is not packet data. Autotuning can increase this value (up to tcp_rmem max) based on how fast the L7 application is able to read data from the socket and the RTT of the session. This is known within the kernel as sk_rcvbuf.</p><p><b>rcv_space</b> is the high water mark of the rate of the local application reading from the receive buffer during any RTT. This is used internally within the kernel to adjust sk_rcvbuf.</p><p>Earlier we mentioned a setting called tcp_rmem. <b>net.ipv4.tcp_rmem</b> consists of three values, but in this document we are always referring to the third value (except where noted). It is a global setting that specifies the maximum amount of memory that any TCP receive buffer can allocate, i.e. the maximum permissible value that autotuning can use for sk_rcvbuf. This is essentially just a failsafe for autotuning, and under normal circumstances should play only a minor role in TCP memory management.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that receive buffer memory is not preallocated. Memory is allocated based on actual packets arriving and sitting in the receive queue. It’s also important to realize that filling up a receive queue is not one of the criteria that autotuning uses to increase sk_rcvbuf. Indeed, preventing this type of excessive buffering (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufferbloat\">bufferbloat</a>) is one of the benefits of autotuning.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"whats-the-problem\">What’s the problem?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#whats-the-problem\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>The problem is that we must have a large TCP receive window for high <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product\">BDP</a> sessions.

When that happens, the Linux kernel will attempt to reduce the amount of memory the receive queue is using by performing what amounts to a “defragmentation” of memory.

It seems reasonable enough as a worst-case latency under normal circumstances.</p><p>For throughput, although we have very fast and modern hardware on the Cloudflare global network, we don’t expect a single TCP session to saturate the hardware. We have arbitrarily chosen 3500 mbps as the highest supported throughput for our highest latency TCP sessions.</p><p>The calculation for those numbers results in a BDP of 131MB, which we round to the more aesthetic value of 128 MiB.</p><p>Recall that allocation of TCP memory includes metadata overhead in addition to packet data. The ratio of actual amount of memory allocated to user payload size varies, depending on NIC driver settings, packet size, and other factors.
