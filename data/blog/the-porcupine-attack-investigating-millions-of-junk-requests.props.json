Here is an example: during these 16 spikes we recorded a total count of a whopping 1.2M unique IP addresses attacking us.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6EtSV8z8pfbXnnebomGU0i/d8619334d05cd0637953111b5e650079/hmillion.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1024\" height=\"633\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This can be explained by bots churning through IP addresses. We believe that out of the estimated 200k bots, between 50k and 100k bots changed their IP addresses during the 80 minutes between attacks. This resulted in 1.2M unique IP addresses during the 16 spikes happening over 24 hours.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"a-botnet\">A botnet?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#a-botnet\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>These spikes were unusual for a number of reasons.</p><ul><li><p>They were generated by a large number of IP addresses. We estimate 200k concurrent bots.</p></li><li><p>The bots were rotating IP addresses aggressively.</p></li><li><p>The bots were from around the world with an emphasis on South America and North Africa.</p></li><li><p>The traffic generated was enormous, reaching 1M junk connections per second.</p></li><li><p>The spikes happened exactly every 80 minutes and lasted for 10 minutes.</p></li><li><p>The payload of the traffic was junk, not a usual HTTP request attack.</p></li><li><p>The payload had uniformly distributed payload sizes.</p></li></ul><p>It&#39;s hard to draw conclusions, but we can imagine two possible scenarios. It is possible these spikes were an attack intended to break our HTTP servers.</p><p>A second possibility is that these spikes were legitimate connection attempts by some weird, obfuscated protocol. For some reason the clients were connecting to port 80/TCP and retried precisely every 80 minutes.</p><p>We are continuing our investigation. In the meantime we are looking for clues. Please do let us know if you have encountered this kind of TCP/IP payload. We are puzzled by these large spikes.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to work on this type of problem <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/join-our-team/\">we&#39;re hiring</a> in London, San Francisco, Austin, Champaign and Singapore.</p><p><i>Update</i> A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GGreg/status/818462582998704128\">Twitter user</a> pointed out that the sequence <code>a6 ef 39 82 cb 15 5e a7 f0 3a 83 cc 16 5f a8 f1 3b</code> appears in this set of <a href=\"https://github.com/gvanas/KeccakCodePackage/blob/master/TestVectors/KetjeJr.txt\">test vectors</a> so we contacted the <a href=\"http://gva.noekeon.org/\">author</a> who was kind enough to reply and point us to the <a href=\"https://github.com/gvanas/KeccakCodePackage/blob/master/Tests/testKetje.c#L46\">code</a> that generated those vectors.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">static void generateSimpleRawMaterial(unsigned char* data, unsigned int length, unsigned char seed1, unsigned int seed2)\n{\n    unsigned int i;\n\n    for( i=0; i&lt;length; i++) {\n        unsigned int iRolled = i*seed1;\n        unsigned char byte = (iRolled+length+seed2)%0xFF;\n        data[i] = byte;\n    }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>Since we identified above that the difference between two bytes seemed to be 0x49 or 0x4a it&#39;s worth looking at the difference between bytes in this algorithm. Simplifying, bytes are generated from:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">((i * seed1) + length + seed2)%0xFF</pre></code>\n            <p>Ignoring the <code>% 0xff</code> for the moment that&#39;s <code>(i * seed1) + length + seed</code>. Taking the difference between two adjacent bytes (for <code>i</code> and <code>i+1</code>) gives a difference of just <code>seed1</code>.</p><p>Thus in our case it&#39;s likely that <code>seed1</code> is 0x49. It&#39;s fairly easy to end up with the following code to generate the sequence:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">seed = 0x49\nbyte = 0xa6\n\ndo\n   byte = (seed + byte) % 0xff\ndone</pre></code>\n            <p>One big mystery remaining is &#39;what&#39;s the 0x75 at the start of the junk data?&#39;.</p><hr/><ol><li><p>Yes, we&#39;re aware that porcupines have spines/quills not spikes. <a href=\"#fnref1\">↩︎</a></p></li></ol>",
