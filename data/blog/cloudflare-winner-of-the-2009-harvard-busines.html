	<p>We're excited to announce that we just got word that Cloudflare won the<br>
		2009 Harvard Business Plan competition. We're extremely excited and<br>
		flattered by the recognition. The competition was a terrific experience<br>
		for Michelle and me. The process of putting together the plan helped us<br>
		understand where the real need in the market for a new performance and<br>
		security solution was -- for small- to mid-sized sites -- as well as to<br>
		come up with a way to deploy a solution that met the needs of those<br>
		sites. We have had a ton of in-bound interest from venture capital firms<br>
		who want to work with us on taking Cloudflare from a plan to a product.<br>
		Stay tuned for what's next!</p>
