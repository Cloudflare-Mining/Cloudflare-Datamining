	<p>Over the last few years the topic of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-cyber-security">cyber security</a> has moved from the IT department to the board room. The current climate of geopolitical and economic uncertainty has made the threat of cyber attacks all the more pressing, with businesses of all sizes and across all industries feeling the impact. From the potential for a crippling ransomware attack to a data breach that could compromise sensitive consumer information, the risks are real and potentially catastrophic. Organizations are recognizing the need for better resilience and preparation regarding cybersecurity. It is not enough to simply react to attacks as they happen; companies must proactively prepare for the inevitable in their approach to cybersecurity.</p>
	<p>The security approach that has gained the most traction in recent years is the concept of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust">Zero Trust</a>. The basic principle behind Zero Trust is simple: don't trust anything; verify everything. The impetus for a modern Zero Trust architecture is that traditional perimeter-based (castle-and-moat) security models are no longer sufficient in today's digitally distributed landscape. Organizations must adopt a holistic approach to security based on verifying the identity and trustworthiness of all users, devices, and systems that access their networks and data.</p>

	<p>Zero Trust has been on the radar of business leaders and board members for some time now. However, Zero Trust is no longer just a concept being discussed; it's now a mandate. With remote or hybrid work now the norm and cyber-attacks continuing to escalate, businesses realize they must take a fundamentally different approach to security. But as with any significant shift in strategy, implementation can be challenging, and efforts can sometimes stall. Although many firms have begun <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/how-to-implement-zero-trust">implementing Zero Trust methods and technologies</a>, only some have fully implemented them throughout the organization. For many large companies, this is the current status of their Zero Trust initiatives - stuck in the implementation phase.</p>

	<p>But what if there was a missing piece in the cybersecurity puzzle that could change everything? Enter the role of "Chief Zero Trust Officer" (CZTO) – a new position that we believe will become increasingly common in large organizations over the next year.</p>
	<p>The idea of companies potentially creating the role of Chief Zero Trust Officer evolved from conversations last year between Cloudflare's Field CTO team members and US federal government agencies. A similar job function was first noted in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">White House memorandum</a> directing federal agencies to “move toward Zero Trust cybersecurity principles” and requiring agencies “designate and identify a Zero Trust strategy implementation lead for their organization” within 30 days. In government, a role like this is often called a "czar," but the title "chief" is more appropriate within a business.</p>
	<p>Large organizations need strong leaders to efficiently get things done. Businesses assign the ultimate leadership responsibility to people with titles that begin with the word chief, such as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or Chief Financial Officer (CFO). These positions exist to provide direction, set strategy, make critical decisions, and manage day-to-day operations and they are often accountable to the board for overall performance and success.</p>

	<p>An old saying goes, “when everyone is responsible, no one is responsible.” As we consider the challenges in implementing Zero Trust within an enterprise, it appears that a lack of clear leadership and accountability is a significant issue. The question remains, who *exactly* is responsible for driving the adoption and execution of Zero Trust within the organization?</p>
	<p>Large enterprises need a single person responsible for driving the Zero Trust journey. This leader should be empowered with a clear mandate and have a singular focus: getting the enterprise to Zero Trust. This is where the idea of the Chief Zero Trust Officer was born. "Chief Zero Trust Officer" may seem like just a title, but it holds a lot of weight. It commands attention and can overcome many obstacles to Zero Trust.</p>

	<p>Implementing Zero Trust can be hindered by various technological challenges. Understanding and implementing the complex architecture of some vendors can take time, demand extensive training, or require a professional services engagement to acquire the necessary expertise. Identifying and verifying users and devices in a Zero Trust environment can also be a challenge. It requires an accurate inventory of the organization's user base, groups they’re a part of, and their applications and devices.</p>
	<p>On the organizational side, coordination between different teams is crucial for effectively implementing Zero Trust. Breaking down the silos between IT, cybersecurity, and networking groups, establishing clear communication channels, and regular meetings between team members can help achieve a cohesive security strategy. General resistance to change can also be a significant obstacle. Leaders should use techniques such as leading by example, transparent communication, and involving employees in the change process to mitigate it. Proactively addressing concerns, providing support, and creating employee training opportunities can also help ease the transition.</p>

	<p>But why does an organization need a CZTO? Is another C-level role essential? Why not assign someone already managing security within the CISO organization? Of course, these are all valid questions. Think about it this way - companies should assign the title based on the level of strategic importance to the company. So, whether it's Chief Zero Trust Officer, Head of Zero Trust, VP of Zero Trust, or something else, the title must command attention and come with the power to break down silos and cut through bureaucracy.</p>
	<p>New C-level titles aren’t without precedent. In recent years, we've seen the emergence of titles such as Chief Digital Transformation Officer, Chief eXperience Officer, Chief Customer Officer, and Chief Data Scientist. The Chief Zero Trust Officer title is likely not even a permanent role. What's crucial is that the person holding the role has the authority and vision to drive the Zero Trust initiative forward, with the support of company leadership and the board of directors.</p>

	<p>Getting to Zero Trust security is now a mandate for many companies, as the traditional <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-the-network-perimeter">perimeter-based security model</a> is no longer enough to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense">protect against today's sophisticated threats</a>. To navigate the technical and organizational challenges that come with Zero Trust implementation, the leadership of a CZTO is crucial. The CZTO will lead the Zero Trust initiative, align teams and break down barriers to achieve a smooth rollout. The role of CZTO in the C-suite emphasizes the importance of Zero Trust in the company. It ensures that the Zero Trust initiative is given the necessary attention and resources to succeed. Organizations that appoint a CZTO now will be the ones that come out on top in the future.</p>
