Salesforce, the sprawling, intricate, hard-to-contain Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform, gives workforces a flexible hub from which they can do just as the software describes: manage customer relationships. Whether it be tracking deals and selling opportunities, managing customer conversations, or storing contractual agreements, Salesforce has truly become the ubiquitous solution for organizations looking for a way to manage every customer-facing interaction they have.</p><p>This reliance, however, also makes Salesforce a business data goldmine for bad actors.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7vgTUpghNJ4h0XJkjIUT1e/75b84bd59e6e64b1c5bd08a34f443c29/CASB_Salesforce_Findings.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1278\" height=\"1154\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>With CASB’s new integration for Salesforce, IT and security operators will be able to quickly connect their environments and scan them for the kind of issues putting their sensitive business data at risk. Spot uploaded files that have been shared publicly with anyone who has the link. Identify default permissions that give employees access to records that should be need-to-know only. You can even see employees who are sending out emails as other Salesforce users!</p><p>Using this new integration, we’re excited to help close the security visibility gap for yet another SaaS app serving as the lifeblood for teams out in the field making business happen.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"scan-box-with-cloudflare-casb\">Scan Box with Cloudflare CASB</h3>\n            <a href=\"#scan-box-with-cloudflare-casb\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Box is the leading Content Cloud that enables organizations to accelerate business processes, power workplace collaboration, and protect their most valuable information, all while working with a best-of-breed enterprise IT stack like Cloudflare.</p><p>A platform used to store everything - from contracts and financials to product roadmaps and employee records - Box has given collaborative organizations a single place to convene and share information that, in a growing remote-first world, has no better place to be stored.</p><p>So where are disgruntled employees and people with malicious intent going to look when they want to unveil private business files?</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/CACCaqOTfhtpJvlYrA4S7/fad020b308d04bcdd7f36db93ab01e13/CASB_Box_Findings.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1278\" height=\"1154\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>With Cloudflare CASB’s new integration for Box, security and IT teams alike can now link their admin accounts and scan them for under-the-radar security issues leaving them prone to compromise and data exfiltration.
