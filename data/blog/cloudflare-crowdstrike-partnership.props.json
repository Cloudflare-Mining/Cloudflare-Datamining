Through our partnerships and integrations, we make it easier for our customers to use Cloudflare solutions jointly with that of partners, to further strengthen their security posture and unlock more value. Our partnership with CrowdStrike is an apt example of such efforts.</p><p>Together, Cloudflare and CrowdStrike are working to simplify the adoption of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust</a> for IT and security teams. With this expanded partnership, joint customers can identify, investigate, and remediate threats faster through multiple integrations:</p><p><b>First,</b> by integrating <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/\">Cloudflare’s Zero Trust services</a> with CrowdStrike Falcon Zero Trust Assessment (ZTA), which provides continuous real-time device posture assessments, our customers can verify users’ device posture before granting them access to internal or external applications.</p><p><b>Second,</b> we joined the <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/press-releases/crowdstrike-adds-new-strategic-partners-to-groundbreaking-crowdxdr-alliance/#:~:text=Cloudflare%2C%20Armis%20and%20ThreatWarrior%20are,%2C%20Mimecast%2C%20Claroty%20and%20Corelight.\">CrowdXDR Alliance</a> in December 2021 and are partnering with CrowdStrike to share security telemetry and other insights to make it easier for customers to identify and mitigate threats. Cloudflare’s global network spans more than 250 cities in over 100 countries, blocking an average of 76 billion cyber threats each day. This provides customers with unparalleled insights, helping security teams better protect their organization. By joining the CrowdXDR Alliance, we will be able to use security signals from Cloudflare’s global network with CrowdStrike’s leading endpoint protection to help mutual customers stop cyber attacks anywhere in their network.</p><p><b>Third,</b> CrowdStrike is one of Cloudflare’s incident response partners, providing rapid and effective support. CrowdStrike’s incident response team deals with active under attack situations day in, day out — helping customers mitigate the attack and get their web property and network back online. Our partnership with CrowdStrike enables rapid remediation of under attack scenarios to safeguard organizations from adversaries.</p><blockquote><p><i>“The speed in which a company is able to identify, investigate and remediate a threat heavily determines how it will fare in the end. Our partnership with Cloudflare provides companies the ability to take action rapidly and contain exposure at the time of an attack, enabling them to get back on their feet and return to business as usual as quickly as possible.”</i>- <b>Thomas Etheridge</b>, Senior Vice President, CrowdStrike Services</p></blockquote><p>CrowdStrike’s endpoint security meets Cloudflare’s Zero Trust Services</p><hr/>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2uD91HZrTzA9yoIVsNgOAk/a11987d539f1b9c7f97bc3d618ec97a0/pasted-image-0--1--1.png\" alt=\"Graphic depicting CrowdStrike and Cloudflare partnership.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"899\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Before we get deep into how the integration works, let’s first recap Cloudflare’s Zero Trust Services.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"cloudflare-access-and-gateway\">Cloudflare Access and Gateway</h3>\n            <a href=\"#cloudflare-access-and-gateway\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/\">Cloudflare Access</a> determines if a user should be allowed access to an application or not.
