Doing so improves the user&#39;s shopping experience and contributes to increasing the proportion of people completing a purchase (conversion rate).</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>Walmart found improving page load time by 1 second increased their conversion rate by 2%</p></li><li><p>Research for Amazon showed every 0.1 second of delay costs 1% of sales</p></li><li><p>The Barack Obama campaign website saw an 80% page load time boost resulted in a 14% increase in donations</p></li></ul>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"what-is-caching\">What is caching?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#what-is-caching\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Cloudflare <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">operates over 110 data centers around the world</a>. When a website implements Cloudflare, visitor requests for the site will proxy through the nearest Cloudflare data center instead of connecting directly to the webserver hosting the site (origin). This means Cloudflare can store content such as images, JavaScript, CSS and HTML on our servers, speeding up access to those resources for end-users.</p><p>Most ecommerce websites rely on a backend database containing product descriptions and metadata such as prices. Without caching, each visit to a product page might involve several database requests to pull all the required data, which can introduce added latency to page load time, particularly on a busy website. Serving the website&#39;s homepage and product pages from Cloudflare&#39;s cache not only eliminates these costly database calls, but also reduces the load on your origin infrastructure.</p><p>To make the most of Cloudflare and to help maximize the speed of your website, serve as much content as possible from the Cloudflare cache.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-cloudflare-caching-works\">How Cloudflare caching works</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-cloudflare-caching-works\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>By default, Cloudflare caches static content based on a <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172516-Which-file-extensions-does-CloudFlare-cache-for-static-content-\">fixed list of file extensions</a> which includes assets such as images, CSS files and PDFs.</p><p>The reason Cloudflare only caches static content out of the box (and does not cache HTML content by default) is to avoid the risk of inappropriate data being cached. For example, if the shopping cart page is cached, then the next visitor might receive the cached version and see a cart with the incorrect contents. Therefore, while enabling more caching will let you make the most of Cloudflare, it requires careful and considered implementation.</p><p>Additional caching on Cloudflare can be enabled in one of two ways - using Page Rules or by sending cache headers from your origin. These two methods are explained in more detail <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/202775670-How-Do-I-Tell-CloudFlare-What-to-Cache-\">here</a>. In this blog post we’ll use Page Rules, but keep in mind you can use headers from your origin too.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"using-caching-on-ecommerce-sites\">Using caching on ecommerce sites</h3>\n            <a href=\"#using-caching-on-ecommerce-sites\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>A typical HTML page on an ecommerce website will contain static content (such as the product description) and dynamic content such as:</p><ul><li><p>a header section which varies according to the visitor’s logged in state - e.g. if the user is logged in, it may offer the user a “Logged in as...&quot; message</p></li><li><p>a basket section which populates as the user shops on the site</p></li></ul>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/693W6zmtTqjWk76TOCYqCB/30e00b0827aae57eac1854572fe227bc/Cloudflare-Ecommerce-Best-Practices.png\" alt=\"A typical ecommerce website - with static elements and dynamic elements\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"954\" height=\"457\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The user might have one or more session cookies to maintain these dynamic elements.</p><p>There are few ways to make the most of Cloudflare&#39;s caching, while taking into account the dynamic nature of ecommerce websites.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"method-1-cache-everything-on-cloudflare-but-bypass-the-cache-for-private-content\">Method 1: cache everything on Cloudflare but bypass the cache for private content</h3>\n            <a href=\"#method-1-cache-everything-on-cloudflare-but-bypass-the-cache-for-private-content\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><i>Note: the Bypass Cache on Cookie feature is only available on the Cloudflare Business and Enterprise </i><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/\"><i>plans</i></a></p><p>Many visitors to a site will be brand new, first time visitors - in other words, they won’t be logged in to the site and won’t have any items in their basket.</p><p>Serving their request from the Cloudflare cache means they can quickly view the page they’re looking for (whether the homepage or a specific product page).
