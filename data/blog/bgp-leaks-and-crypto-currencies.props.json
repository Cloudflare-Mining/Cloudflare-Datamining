When a transit provider picks up Cloudflare&#39;s announcement of <code>1.1.1.0/24</code> and announces it to the Internet, we allow them to do so. They are also verifying using the RIR information that only Cloudflare can announce it to them.</p><p>Although it can get tricky checking all the announcements. Especially when there are <b>700,000+</b> routes on the Internet and chains of providers exchanging traffic between each other.</p><p>By their nature, route leaks are localized. The more locally connected you are, the smaller the risk of accepting a leaked route is.In order to be accepted over a legitimate route, the route has to be either:</p><ul><li><p>A smaller prefix (<code>10.0.0.1/32</code> = 1 IP vs <code>10.0.0.0/24</code> = 256 IPs)</p></li><li><p>Have better metrics than a prefix with the same length (shorter path)</p></li></ul><p>The cause of a BGP leak is usually a <b>configuration mistake</b>: a router suddenly announces the IPs it learned. Or smaller prefixes used internally for traffic engineering suddenly becoming public.</p><p>But sometimes it is done with a <b>malicious intent</b>. The prefix can be re-routed through in order to passively analyze the data. Or somebody can also set-up a service to reply illegitimately instead.

But only some regions got affected. Hurricane Electric has a strong presence <b>Australia</b>, mostly due to Internet costs. <b>Chicago</b> was affected because AS10279 has a physical presence resulting in direct peering.</p><p>The following graph displays the number of packets received in the affected regions and unaffected regions (Y axis normalized).

IP and BGP were created a few decades ago, with different requirements in mind regarding integrity and authenticity (less routes).</p><p>A few things can be done on the upper levels of the network stack.</p><p>On <b>DNS</b>, you can use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions\">DNSSEC</a> to sign your records. The IPs returned by the fake DNS would not have been signed as they do not have the private keys.If you use Cloudflare as a DNS, you can enable DNSSEC within <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com/a/dns\">a few clicks in the panel</a>.</p><p>On <b>HTTPS</b>, your browser will check the TLS certificate provided by the website. If <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security\">HSTS</a> is enabled, the browser will require a valid certificate all the time. The only way to generate a legitimate TLS certificate for a domain would be to poison the cache of a non-DNSSEC DNS resolver of the Certificate Authority.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities\">DANE</a> provides a way of pinning certificates to a domain name using DNS.</p><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https/\">DNS over HTTPS</a> would also allow to validate you are talking to the correct resolver in case the leak would be on the DNS resolvers instead of the DNS authority.</p><p>There is no perfect and unique solution. The more of these protections are in place, the harder it will be for a malicious actor to perform this kind of attack.</p>",
