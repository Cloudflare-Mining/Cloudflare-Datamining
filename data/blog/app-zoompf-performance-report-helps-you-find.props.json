This ensures that all your pages are optimized.</p>\n<p>Next, Zoompf tests for over 100 different performance issues from their comprehensive database of over 400. Free tools test for only a dozen or so issues.</p>\n<p>Finally, while a free tool might provide a sentences or two description about a performance issue, Zoompf provides a wealth of information including a summary, easy-to-fix ratings, and detailed remediation information -- all with accompanying diagrams and code snippets.</p>\n<p>Testing more of your website, for more issues, and providing more information about how to be faster makes Zoompf the best front-end performance analysis tool available today.</p>\n<h3 id=\"resultsyoucanuse\">Results You Can Use</h3>\n<p>Zoompf Performance Report helps you find and fix performance issues to drop seconds off page load times, improve user satisfaction, drive additional revenue, and reduce operational costs. <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/apps/zoompf_report\">Get your report today!</a></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
