When a visitor to a customer’s website requests an asset, we retrieve it from the customer’s origin server. After that first request, in many cases we <i>cache</i> that asset. Whenever anyone requests it again, we can serve it from one of our data centers close to them, dramatically speeding up load times.</p><p>Did you notice the small caveat? We cache after the <i>first</i> request in <i>many</i> cases, not all. One notable exception since 2010 up until now: requests with <i>query strings</i>. When a request came with a query string (think <a href=\"https://example.com/image.jpg?width=500\">https://example.com/image.jpg?width=500</a>; the <code>?width=500</code> is the query string), we needed to see it a whole <i>three</i> times before we would cache it on our <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168256-Understand-Cloudflare-Caching-Level\">default cache level</a>. Weird!</p><p>This is a short tale of that strange exception, why we thought we needed it, and how, more than ten years later, we showed ourselves that we didn’t.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"two-misses-too-many\">Two MISSes too many</h3>\n      <a href=\"#two-misses-too-many\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>To see the exception in action, here’s a command we ran a couple weeks ago.

Since then, it has spawned chat threads, customer escalations, and even an internal Solutions Engineering blog post that christened it the “third time’s the charm” quirk.</p><p>It would be much less confusing if we could make the query string behavior align with the others, but why was the quirk here to begin with?</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"unpopular-queries\">Unpopular queries</h3>\n      <a href=\"#unpopular-queries\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>From an engineering perspective, forcing three MISSes for query strings can make sense as a way to protect ourselves from unnecessary disk writes.</p><p>That’s because for many requests with query strings in the URL, we may never see that URL requested again.</p><ol><li><p>Some query strings simply pass along data to the origin server that may not actually result in a different response from the base URL, for example, a visitor’s browser metadata.

Previously, <a href=\"/why-we-started-putting-unpopular-assets-in-memory/\">we wrote about how we use an in-memory transient cache</a> to store requests we only ever see once (dubbed “one-hit-wonders”) so that they are never written to disk.

In fact, if the assumptions about many query string requests being one-hit-wonders were correct, we should hardly be seeing any difference at all. (One-hit-wonders are actually “one MISS wonders” in the context of hit rate.) Instead, we saw hit rate increases proportional to the affected traffic percentage. This, along with the minor I/O cost increases, signaled that the benefits of removing the behavior would outweigh the benefits of keeping it.</p><p>Using a data-driven approach, we determined our caution around caching query string requests wasn’t nearly as effective at preventing disk writes of unpopular requests compared to our newer efforts, such as transient cache. It was a good reminder for us to re-examine past assumptions from time-to-time and see if they still held.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/29s2kKkqUOMWDmlFHY5qp8/60a7d113cde89a6e197d4536bd911e7b/image4-15.png\" alt=\"Revisiting old assumptions\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1918\" height=\"1068\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Post-experiment, we gradually rolled out the change to verify that our cost expectations were met.
