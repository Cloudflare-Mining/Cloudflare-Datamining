	<p>On September 1, we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unrest-in-gabon-leads-to-internet-shutdown/">reported</a> that we had seen a complete shutdown of Internet access to CloudFlare sites from Gabon.</p>
	<p>This morning, Internet connectivity in Gabon appears to have been at least partially restored starting at around 0500 UTC. Some <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2016/09/05/gabon-les-connexions-a-internet-sont-partiellement-retablies-a-libreville_4992534_3212.html" target="_blank">news reports</a> indicate that Internet access has been restored in the capital but that access to social media sites is still restricted.</p>

	<p>We will continue to monitor the situation to see if traffic from Gabon return to its normal levels and update this blog post.</p>
	<p><strong>September 6, 2016: 0800 UTC</strong>: although Internet service appears to have been restored in Gabon, there appears to have been an Internet "curfew" overnight with the Internet disabled last night and reenabled this morning.</p>
