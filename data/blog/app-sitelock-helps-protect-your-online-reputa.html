	<p>SiteLock is a website security monitoring service that protects your online reputation and provides additional security to your website.</p>
	<p>There have never been more threats to your website than now. Hackers use malware, SQL Injection, Cross-site scripting and more sophisticated techniques to steal your customer data or redirect your traffic, ruining your site's reputation.</p>
	<p>SiteLock will alert you if your site is vulnerable to these issues, as well as if your site gets blocklisted for any reason by search engines or spam monitoring tools. SiteLock combines two types of scanning to provide an additional layer of security beyond the existing protection of CloudFlare to ensure your investment is protected and your reputation is safe.</p>
	<p>Proactive scanning: Searches your site and network for common weak spots hackers exploit to inject malicious code into your site</p>
