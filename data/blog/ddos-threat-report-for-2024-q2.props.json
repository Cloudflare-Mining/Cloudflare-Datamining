Short for <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\">Distributed Denial of Service</a>, a DDoS attack is a type of cyber attack designed to take down or disrupt Internet services, such as websites or mobile apps, making them unavailable to users. This is typically achieved by overwhelming the victim&#39;s server with more traffic than it can handle — usually from multiple sources across the Internet, rendering it unable to handle legitimate user traffic.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2S7TgrtK197L1YGvjBgZm2/0664811e82a92b1c9c1a178458f75550/unnamed-4.png\" alt=\"Diagram of a DDoS attack\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"849\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Diagram of a DDoS attack</p><p>To learn more about DDoS attacks and other types of cyber threats, visit our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/\">Learning Center</a>, access <a href=\"/tag/ddos-reports\">previous DDoS threat reports</a> on the Cloudflare blog or visit our interactive hub, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports?q=DDoS\">Cloudflare Radar</a>.

This number of 1.8 million HTTP DDoS attacks has been normalized to compensate for the explosion in sophisticated and randomized HTTP DDoS attacks. Our automated mitigation systems generate real-time fingerprints for DDoS attacks, and due to the randomized nature of these sophisticated attacks, we observed many fingerprints being generated for single attacks. The actual number of fingerprints that was generated was closer to 19 million – over ten times larger than the normalized figure of 1.8 million. The millions of fingerprints that were generated to deal with the randomization stemmed from a few single rules. These rules did their job to stop attacks, but they inflated the numbers, so we excluded them from the calculation.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3NbYriDgdvtAormXB1spNP/c8ef433d3386dd7f44ee72c7625fd980/unnamed--3--2.png\" alt=\"HTTP DDoS attacks by quarter, with the excluded fingerprints\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1140\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>HTTP DDoS attacks by quarter, with the excluded fingerprints</p><p>This ten-fold difference underscores the dramatic change in the threat landscape. The tools and capabilities that allowed threat actors to carry out such randomized and sophisticated attacks were previously associated with capabilities reserved for state-level actors or state-sponsored actors. But, coinciding with the rise of generative AI and autopilot systems that can help actors write better code faster, these capabilities have made their way to the common cyber criminal.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"ransom-ddos-attacks\">Ransom DDoS attacks</h2>\n            <a href=\"#ransom-ddos-attacks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>In May 2024, the percentage of attacked Cloudflare customers that reported being threatened by a DDoS attack threat actor, or subjected to a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ransom-ddos-attack/\">Ransom DDoS attack</a> reached 16% – the highest it’s been in the past 12 months.

An additional 13% had suspicious HTTP attributes which triggered our automated system, and 7% were marked as generic floods.

Only 1% of network-layer DDoS attacks last more than 3 hours.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5THWXBww1SvjFhGz3faxvf/27b48ed6dac038a9342c84ec0661caa4/unnamed--15-.png\" alt=\"HTTP DDoS attacks: distribution by duration\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"916\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>HTTP DDoS attacks: distribution by duration</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1jCKPONG0sxuKYTVU1dne5/69f9f38dae5d46b0b2c5b40f9d97f2a3/unnamed--16-.png\" alt=\"Network-layer DDoS attacks: distribution by duration\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"920\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Network-layer DDoS attacks: distribution by duration</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"ddos-attack-size\">DDoS attack size</h3>\n            <a href=\"#ddos-attack-size\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Most DDoS attacks are relatively small.

Even prior to the rise in attack sophistication, many organizations struggled to defend against these threats on their own. But they don’t need to. Cloudflare is here to help. We invest significant resources – so you don’t have to – to ensure our automated defenses, along with the entire portfolio of Cloudflare security products, to protect against existing and emerging threats.</p>",
