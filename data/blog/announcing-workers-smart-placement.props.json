Anything less than instant and your mind wanders to something else...</p><p>One way to make things fast is to bring resources as close to the user as possible — this is what Cloudflare has been doing with compute by running within milliseconds of most of the world’s population. But, counterintuitive as it may seem, sometimes bringing compute closer to the user can actually slow applications down. If your application needs to connect to APIs, databases or other resources that aren’t located near the end user then it can be more performant to run the application near the resources instead of the user.</p><p>So today we’re excited to announce Smart Placement for Workers and Pages Functions, making every interaction as fast as possible. With Smart Placement, Cloudflare is taking serverless computing to the Supercloud by moving compute resources to optimal locations in order to speed up applications. The best part – it’s completely automatic, without any extra input (like the dreaded “region”) needed.</p><p>Smart Placement is available now, in open beta, to all Workers and Pages customers!</p><p><a href=\"https://smart-placement-demo.pages.dev/\">Check out our demo on how Smart Placement works!</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p></p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"the-serverless-shift\">The serverless shift</h2>\n            <a href=\"#the-serverless-shift\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare’s anycast network is built to process requests <i>instantly and close to the user</i>. As a developer, that’s what makes Cloudflare Workers, our serverless compute offering so compelling. Competitors are bounded by “regions” while Workers run everywhere — hence we have one region: Earth. Requests handled entirely by Workers can be processed right then and there, without ever having to hit an origin server.</p><p>While this concept of serverless was originally considered to be for lightweight tasks, serverless computing has been seeing a shift in recent years. It’s being used to replace traditional architecture, which relies on origin servers and self-managed infrastructure, instead of simply augmenting it. We’re seeing more and more of these use cases with Workers and Pages users.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"serverless-needs-state\">Serverless needs state</h3>\n            <a href=\"#serverless-needs-state\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>With the shift to going serverless and building entire applications on Workers comes a need for data.

Smart Placement takes these factors into consideration to automatically place your Worker in the best spot to minimize overall request duration.</p><p>So, how does Smart Placement work?</p><p>Smart Placement can be enabled on a per-Worker basis under the “Settings” tab or in your wrangler.toml file:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">[placement]\nmode = &quot;smart&quot;</pre></code>\n            <p>Once you enable Smart Placement on your Worker or Pages Function, the Smart Placement algorithm analyzes fetch requests (also known as subrequests) that your Worker is making in real time. It then compares these to latency data aggregated by our network. If we detect that on average your Worker makes more than one subrequest to a back-end resource, then your Worker will automatically get invoked from the optimal data center!</p><p>There are some back-end services that, for good reason, are not considered by the Smart Placement algorithm:</p><ul><li><p>Globally distributed services: If the services that your Worker communicates with are geo-distributed in many regions, Smart Placement isn’t a good fit. We automatically rule these out of the Smart Placement optimization.</p></li><li><p>Analytics or logging services: Requests to analytics or logging services don’t need to be in the critical path of your application. <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event/?ref=blog.cloudflare.com#waituntil\"><code>waitUntil()</code></a> should be used so that the response back to users isn’t blocked when instrumenting your code. Since <code>waitUntil()</code> doesn’t impact the request duration from a user’s perspective, we automatically rule analytics/logging services out of the Smart Placement optimization.</p></li></ul><p>Refer to our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/smart-placement/#supported-backends\">documentation</a> for a list of services not considered by the Smart Placement algorithm.</p><p>Once Smart Placement kicks in, you’ll be able to see a new “Request Duration” tab on your Worker.
