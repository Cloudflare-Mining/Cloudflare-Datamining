It enables security teams to quickly identify potential security risks and threats to their organizations, map their <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-an-attack-surface/\">attack surface</a> and mitigate these risks with just a few clicks. While Security Center initially focused on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/\">application security</a>, we are now adding crucial <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">zero trust</a> insights to further enhance its capabilities.</p><p>When your brand is loved and trusted, customers and prospects are looking forward to the emails you send them. Now picture them receiving an email from you: it has your brand, the subject is exciting, it has a link to register for something unique — how can they resist that opportunity?</p><p>But what if that email didn’t come from you? What if clicking on that link is a scam that takes them down the path of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email-fraud/\">fraud or identity theft</a>? And what if they think you did it? The truth is, even security minded people occasionally fall for well crafted spoof emails.</p><p>That poses a risk to your business and reputation. A risk you don’t want to take - no one does. Brand impersonation is a <a href=\"/2022-march-hackness-phishing-bracket/\">significant problem for organizations globally</a>, and that’s why we’ve built DMARC Management - available in Beta today.</p><p>With DMARC Management you have full insight on who is sending emails on your behalf. You can one-click approve each source that is a legitimate sender for your domain, and then set your <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/\">DMARC</a> policy to reject any emails sent from unapproved clients.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5V4jHlhrGCxkmpTmaEwd7Y/486d9851a7ad4ded33940bee10638200/DMARC-1.jpg\" alt=\"On the DMARC Management one can see trends of messages passing or failing DMARC, and a breakdown by sending client (source)\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1419\" height=\"1600\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When the survey platform your company uses is sending emails from your domain, there’s nothing to worry about - you configured it that way. But if an unknown mail service from a remote country is sending emails using your domain that can be quite scary, and something you’ll want to address.

Together, they help <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/how-to-prevent-phishing/\">prevent</a> spammers, phishers, and other unauthorized parties from sending emails on behalf of a domain they do not own.</p><p><b>SPF</b> is a way for a domain to list all the servers the company sends emails from. Think of it like a publicly available employee directory that helps someone to confirm if an employee works for an organization. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/\">SPF records</a> list all the IP addresses of all the servers that are allowed to send emails from the domain.</p><p><b>DKIM</b> enables domain owners to automatically &quot;sign&quot; emails from their domain. Specifically, DKIM uses <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/\">public key cryptography</a>:</p><ol><li><p>A <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/\">DKIM record</a> stores the domain&#39;s <i>public key</i>, and mail servers receiving emails from the domain can check this record to obtain the public <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-a-cryptographic-key/\">key</a>.</p></li><li><p>The <i>private key</i> is kept secret by the sender, who signs the email&#39;s header with this key.</p></li><li><p>Mail servers receiving the email can verify that the sender&#39;s private key was used by applying the public key. This also guarantees that the email was not tampered with while in transit.</p></li></ol><p><b>DMARC</b> tells a receiving email server what to do after evaluating the SPF and DKIM results. A domain&#39;s DMARC policy can be set in a variety of ways — it can instruct mail servers to quarantine emails that fail SPF or DKIM (or both), to reject such emails, or to deliver them.</p><p>It’s not trivial to configure and maintain SPF and DMARC, though. If your configuration is too strict, legitimate emails will be dropped or marked as spam. If it’s too relaxed, your domain might be misused for email spoofing. The proof is that these authentication mechanisms (SPF / DKIM / DMARC) have existed for over 10 years and still, there are still <a href=\"https://dmarc.org/stats/dmarc/\">less than 6 million active DMARC records</a>.</p><p>DMARC reports can help, and a full solution like DMARC Management reduces the burden of creating and maintaining a proper configuration.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"dmarc-reports\">DMARC reports</h3>\n            <a href=\"#dmarc-reports\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>All DMARC-compliant mailbox providers support sending DMARC aggregated reports to an email address of your choice.
