		"html": "<p>Security professionals everywhere face a paradox: while more data provides the visibility needed to catch threats, it also makes it harder for humans to process it all and find what&#39;s important. When there’s a sudden spike in suspicious traffic, every second counts. But for many security teams — especially lean ones — it’s hard to quickly figure out what’s going on. Finding a root cause means diving into dashboards, filtering logs, and cross-referencing threat feeds. All the data tracking that has happened can be the very thing that slows you down — or worse yet, what buries the threat that you’re looking for. </p><p>Today, we’re excited to announce that we’ve solved that problem. We’ve integrated <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-ai-agent/\"><u>Cloudy</u></a> — Cloudflare’s first <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-agentic-ai/\"><u>AI agent</u></a> — with our security analytics functionality, and we’ve also built a new, conversational interface that Cloudflare users can use to ask questions, refine investigations, and get answers.  With these changes, Cloudy can now help Cloudflare users find the needle in the digital haystack, making security analysis faster and more accessible than ever before.  </p><p>Since Cloudly’s launch in March of this year, its adoption has been exciting to watch. Over <b>54,000</b> users have tried Cloudy for <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/\"><u>custom rule</u></a> creation, and <b>31%</b> of them have deployed a rule suggested by the agent. For our log explainers in <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/gateway/\"><u>Cloudflare Gateway</u></a>, Cloudy has been loaded over <b>30,000 </b> times in just the last month, with <b>80%</b> of the feedback we received confirming the summaries were insightful. We are excited to empower our users to do even more.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"talk-to-your-traffic-a-new-conversational-interface-for-faster-rca-and-mitigation\">Talk to your traffic: a new conversational interface for faster RCA and mitigation</h2>\n      <a href=\"#talk-to-your-traffic-a-new-conversational-interface-for-faster-rca-and-mitigation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Security analytics dashboards are powerful, but they often require you to know exactly what you&#39;re looking for — and the right queries to get there. The new Cloudy chat interface changes this. It is designed for faster root cause analysis (RCA) of traffic anomalies, helping you get from “something’s wrong” to “here’s the fix” in minutes. You can now start with a broad question and narrow it down, just like you would with a human analyst.</p><p>For example, you can start an investigation by asking Cloudy to look into a recommendation from Security Analytics.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1P7YDzX9JoHmmKLPwGw0z8/aa3675b36492ea13e2cba4d1ba13dce4/image4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"532\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6Nort6ZEZUUkYQc8PTiLgo/33a92121c4c161290f50e792d77c1e16/image1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1156\" height=\"1474\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>From there, you can ask follow-up questions to dig deeper:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;Focus on login endpoints only.&quot;</p></li><li><p>&quot;What are the top 5 IP addresses involved?&quot;</p></li><li><p>&quot;Are any of these IPs known to be malicious?&quot;</p></li></ul><p>This is just the beginning of how Cloudy is transforming security.

What if Cloudy could look beyond your own data and into Cloudflare’s global network to identify emerging threats? This is where Cloudforce One&#39;s <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/threat-events-platform/\"><u>Threat Events platform</u></a> comes in.</p><p>Cloudforce One translates the high-volume attack data observed on the Cloudflare network into real-time, attacker-attributed events relevant to your organization. This platform helps you track adversary activity at scale — including APT infrastructure, cybercrime groups, compromised devices, and volumetric DDoS activity. Threat events provide detailed, context-rich events, including interactive timelines and mappings to attacker TTPs, regions, and targeted verticals. </p><p>We have spent the last few months making Cloudy more powerful by integrating it with the Cloudforce One Threat Events platform.  Cloudy now can offer contextual data about the threats we observe and mitigate across Cloudflare&#39;s global network, spanning everything from APT activity and residential proxies to ACH fraud, DDoS attacks, WAF exploits, cybercrime, and compromised devices. This integration empowers our users to quickly understand, prioritize, and act on <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-are-indicators-of-compromise/\"><u>indicators of compromise (IOCs)</u></a> based on a vast ocean of real-time threat data. </p><p>Cloudy lets you query this global dataset in a natural language and receive clear, concise answers. For example, imagine asking these questions and getting immediate actionable answers:</p><ul><li><p>Who is targeting my industry vertical or country?</p></li><li><p>What are the most relevant indicators (IPs, JA3/4 hashes, ASNs, domains, URLs, SHA fingerprints) to block right now?</p></li><li><p>How has a specific adversary progressed across the cyber kill chain over time?</p></li><li><p>What novel new threats are threat actors using that might be used against your network next, and what insights do Cloudflare analysts know about them?</p></li></ul><p>Simply interact with Cloudy in the Cloudflare Dashboard &gt; Security Center &gt; Threat Intelligence, providing your queries in natural language. It can walk you from a single indicator (like an IP address or domain) to the specific threat event Cloudflare observed, and then pivot to other related data — other attacks, related threats, or even other activity from the same actor. </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4WE42KXmWzejXpk8CsG05h/2fe63d5f86fe78642a341d645844ab56/image2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1229\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>This cuts through the noise, so you can quickly understand an adversary&#39;s actions across the cyber kill chain and MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, and then block attacks with precise, actionable intelligence. The threat events platform is like an evidence board on the wall that helps you understand threats; Cloudy is like your sidekick that will run down every lead.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-it-works-agents-sdk-and-workers-ai\">How it works: Agents SDK and Workers AI</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-it-works-agents-sdk-and-workers-ai\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Developing this advanced capability for Cloudy was a testament to the agility of Cloudflare&#39;s AI ecosystem.

This allowed for rapid iteration and deployment, ensuring Cloudy could quickly grasp the nuances of threat intelligence and provide highly accurate, contextualized insights. The combination of our massive network telemetry, purpose-built LLM prompts, and the flexibility of Workers AI means Cloudy is not just fast, but also remarkably precise.</p><p>And a quick word on what we didn’t do when developing Cloudy: We did not train Cloudy on any Cloudflare customer data.
