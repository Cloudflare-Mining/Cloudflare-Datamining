LAMP originally stood for Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP. You'll find this basic stack at the core of companies like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and more. While some argue that the P should stand for Python, and we at CloudFlare tend to prefer Postgres to MySQL and NGINX to Apache, the general point is the same: with these free foundational tools, great Internet applications can be made.</p>\n<p>We were tickled the other day when we heard someone giving a talk on the &quot;CLAMP&quot; stack: CloudFlare + LAMP. More and more companies are using CloudFlare to extend the scalability of the LAMP stack from an individual machine to a global network. CloudFlare cuts the load on a typical LAMP stack web server by nearly 70%. That allows you to put twice the load on a single server the LAMP burning out.</p>\n<p>With integration into more and more of the <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/hosting-partners\">top hosting providers</a>, it's easier than ever to turn your LAMP into a CLAMP.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
