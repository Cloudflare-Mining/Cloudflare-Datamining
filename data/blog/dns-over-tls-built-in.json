	"description": "Back in April, I wrote about how it was possible to modify a router to encrypt DNS queries over TLS using Cloudflare&#x27;s 1.1.1.1 DNS Resolver and a GL.iNet router; the folks at GL.iNet read that blog post and decided to bake DNS-Over-TLS support into their new router using the 1.1.1.1 resolver."
