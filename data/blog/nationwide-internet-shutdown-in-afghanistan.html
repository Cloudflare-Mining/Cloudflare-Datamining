	<p>Just after 11:30 UTC (16:00 local time) on Monday, September 29, 2025, subscribers of wired Internet providers in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/af"><u>Afghanistan</u></a> experienced a <a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1972649804821057727"><u>brief service interruption</u></a>, lasting until just before 12:00 UTC (16:30 local time). Cloudflare <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=netflows&amp;loc=&amp;dt=1d&amp;asn=as131284&amp;compAsn=as38742&amp;timeCompare=2025-09-21"><u>traffic data for AS38472 (Afghan Wireless) and AS131284 (Etisalat)</u></a> shows that traffic from these mobile providers remained available during that period.</p>
	<p>However, just after 12:30 UTC (17:00 local time), the Internet was <a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1972682041759076637"><u>completely shut down</u></a>, with Afghani news outlet TOLOnews initially <a href="https://x.com/TOLONewsEnglish/status/1972641017745588605"><u>reporting in a post on X</u></a> that “<i>Sources have confirmed to TOLOnews that today (Monday), afternoon, fiber-optic Internet will be shut down across the country.</i>” This shutdown is likely an extension of the regional shutdowns of fiber optic connections that took place earlier in September, and it will <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/afghanistan-taliban-shuts-down-internet-indefinitely/a-74181089"><u>reportedly</u></a> remain in force “until further notice”. (The earlier regional shutdowns are discussed in more detail below.)</p>
	<p>While Monday’s first shutdown was only partial, with mobile connectivity apparently remaining available, the graphs below show that the second event took the country completely offline, with <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/af?dateStart=2025-09-29&amp;dateEnd=2025-09-29#traffic-trends"><u>web</u></a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/dns/af?dateStart=2025-09-29&amp;dateEnd=2025-09-29#dns-query-volume"><u>DNS</u></a> traffic dropping to zero at a national level, as seen in the graphs below.</p>
	<p>While the shutdown will impact subscribers to fixed and mobile Internet services, it also “<a href="https://www.turkiyetoday.com/world/afghanistan-descends-into-total-communications-blackout-under-taliban-order-3207737"><u>threatens to paralyze critical services including banking, customs operations and emergency communications</u></a>” across the country. The <a href="https://x.com/TOLONewsEnglish/status/1972641017745588605"><u>X post from TOLOnews</u></a> also noted that television and radio networks would face disruptions.</p>
	<p>HTTP request traffic is traffic coming from web browsers, applications, and automated tools, and is a clear signal of the availability of Internet connectivity. The graph below shows this request volume dropping sharply as the shutdown was implemented.</p>

	<p><sup><i>HTTP request traffic from the top five provinces in Afghanistan, September 29, 2025</i></sup></p>
	<p>The delay in traffic loss seen in Kabul may be associated with a more gradual loss of traffic seen at <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/AS38742"><u>AS38742 (Afghan Wireless)</u></a>, which saw traffic approach zero just after 13:00 UTC (17:30 local time). This conjecture is supported by a <a href="https://kabulnow.com/2025/09/taliban-order-nationwide-shutdown-of-internet-and-mobile-services-in-afghanistan"><u>published report</u></a> that noted “Residents across Kabul and several provincial cities reported on Monday that fiber-optic services were no longer available, with only limited mobile data functioning briefly before signal towers stopped working altogether.”</p>
	<p>Interestingly, it appears that as of 00:00 UTC (04:30 local time) on September 30, we continue to see a very small amount of traffic from this network. (This is in contrast to other networks, whose lines disappeared from the graph around 12:30 UTC (17:00 local time)).</p>

	<p><sup><i>HTTP request traffic from the top 10 ASNs in Afghanistan, September 29, 2025</i></sup></p>
	<p>Network providers announce IP address space that they are responsible for to other networks, enabling the routing of traffic to and from those IP addresses. When these announcements are withdrawn, the resources in that address space, whether clients or servers, can no longer reach, or are no longer reachable from, the rest of the Internet.</p>
	<p>In Afghanistan, announced IPv4 address space dropped rapidly as the shutdown was implemented, falling by two-thirds from 604 to 197 announced /24s (blocks of 256 IPv4 addresses) in the first 20 minutes, and then dropping further over the next 90 minutes. Through the end of the day, several networks continued to announce a small amount of IPv4 address space: four /24s from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/AS38742"><u>AS38742 (Afghan Wireless)</u></a>, two from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/AS149024"><u>AS149024 (Afghan Bawar ICT Services)</u></a>, and one each from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/AS138322"><u>AS138322 (Afghan Wireless)</u></a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/AS136479"><u>AS136479 (Cyber Telecom)</u></a>.</p>
	<p>Afghan Wireless is a mobile connectivity provider, and <a href="http://afghanbawar.com"><u>Afghan Bawar</u></a> and <a href="https://cts.af/about-us"><u>Cyber Telecom</u></a> appear to offer wireless/mobile services as well. The <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/prefix/152.36.203.0/24"><u>prefixes</u></a> still visible from Afghan Wireless appear to be routed through <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as17557"><u>AS17557 (Pakistan Telecom)</u></a>, while the prefixes from the other two providers (<a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/prefix/163.223.180.0/23"><u>Afghan Bawar</u></a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/prefix/103.126.5.0/24"><u>Cyber Telecom</u></a>) appear to be routed through <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as40676"><u>AS40676 (Psychz Networks)</u></a>, a US-based solutions provider.</p>

	<p>In mid-September, the Taliban <a href="https://amu.tv/200798"><u>ordered the shutdown of fiber optic Internet connectivity</u></a> in multiple provinces across Afghanistan, as part of a drive to “prevent immorality”. It was the first such ban issued since the Taliban took full control of the country in August 2021.</p>
	<p>These regional shutdowns <a href="https://www.afghanstudiescenter.org/taliban-internet-shutdown-blocks-thousands-of-afghan-students-from-online-classes"><u>blocked</u></a> Afghani students from attending online classes, <a href="https://theweek.com/world-news/afghanistan-taliban-high-speed-internet-women-education"><u>impacted</u></a> commerce and banking, and <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/afghanistan-whats-at-stake-as-taliban-cut-internet/a-74043564"><u>limited access</u></a> to government agencies and institutions such as passport and registration offices, customs offices. As many as <a href="https://amu.tv/200798"><u>15 provinces</u></a> experienced shutdowns, and we review the observed impacts across several of them below, using the regional traffic data <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/new-regional-internet-traffic-and-certificate-transparency-insights-on-radar"><u>recently made available</u></a> on Cloudflare Radar.</p>
