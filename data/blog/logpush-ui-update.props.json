We have “HTTP Request” Logs, or one log line for every L7 HTTP request that we handle (whether cached or not). We also provide connection Logs for Spectrum, our proxy for any TCP or UDP based application. Gateway, part of our Cloudflare for Teams suite, can provide Logs for <a href=\"/export-logs-from-cloudflare-gateway-with-logpush/\">HTTP and DNS</a> traffic.</p><p>Today, we are introducing two new data sets:</p><p><b>Firewall Events</b> gives insight into malicious traffic handled by Cloudflare. It provides detailed information about everything our WAF does. For example, Firewall Events shows whether a request was blocked outright or whether we issued a CAPTCHA challenge.  <a href=\"/stream-firewall-events-directly-to-your-siem/\">About a year ago</a> we introduced the ability to send Firewall Events directly to your <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-siem/\">SIEM</a>; starting today, I’m thrilled to share that you can enable this directly from the dashboard!</p><p><a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050691831-Understanding-Network-Error-Logging\"><b>Network Error Logging</b></a> <b>(NEL) Reports</b> provides information about clients that can’t reach our network.

Getting high volume log data out of object storage and into an analytics provider can require building and maintaining a costly, time-consuming, and fragile integration.</p><p>Because of this, we now provide direct integrations with four analytics platforms: Microsoft Azure Sentinel, Sumo Logic, Splunk, and Datadog. And starting today, you can push Logs directly into Sumo Logic, Splunk and Datadog from the UI! Customers can add Cloudflare to Azure Sentinel using the <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azuresentinel.azure-sentinel-solution-cloudflare?tab=Overview\">Azure Marketplace</a>.</p><blockquote><p><i>“Organizations are in a state of digital transformation on a journey to the cloud. Most of our customers deploy services in multiple clouds and have legacy systems on premise. Splunk provides visibility across all of this, and more importantly, with SOAR we can automate remediation. We are excited about the Cloudflare partnership, and adding their data into Splunk drives the outcomes customers need to modernize their security operations.”</i><i>— </i><b><i>Jane Wong</i></b><i>, Vice President, Product Management, Security at Splunk</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&quot;Securing enterprise IT environments can be challenging - from devices, to users, to apps, to data centers on-premises or in the cloud. In today’s environment of increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, our mutual customers rely on Microsoft Azure Sentinel for a comprehensive view of their enterprise.  Azure Sentinel enables SecOps teams to collect data at cloud scale and empowers them with AI and ML to find the real threats in those signals, reducing alert fatigue by as much as 90%. By integrating directly with Cloudflare Logs we are making it easier and faster for customers to get complete visibility across their entire stack.”</i><i>— </i><b><i>Sarah Fender</i></b><i>, Partner Group Program Manager, Azure Sentinel at Microsoft</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&quot;As a long time Cloudflare partner we&#39;ve worked together to help joint customers analyze events and trends from their websites and applications to provide end-to-end visibility to improve digital experiences.

We do that by providing a massive global network that protects and accelerates our customers’ infrastructure. Because traffic flows across our network before reaching our customers, it means we have a unique vantage point into that traffic. In many cases, we have visibility that our customers don’t have — whether we’re telling them about the performance of our cache, the malicious HTTP requests we drop at our edge, a spike in L3 data flows, the performance of their origin, or the CPU used by their serverless applications.</p><p>To provide this ability, we have analytics throughout our dashboard to help customers understand their network traffic, firewall, cache, load balancer, and much more. We also provide alerts that can tell customers when they see an <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037465932-Preventing-site-downtime\">increase in errors</a> or <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053216191-Understanding-Cloudflare-DDoS-alerts\">spike in DDoS activity</a>.</p><p>But some customers want more than what we currently provide with our analytics products. Many of our enterprise customers use SIEMs like Splunk and Sumo Logic or cloud monitoring tools like Datadog. These products can extend the capabilities of Cloudflare by showcasing Cloudflare data in the context of customers’ other infrastructure and providing advanced functionality on this data.</p><p>To understand how this works, consider a typical L7 DDoS attack against one of our customers.  Very commonly, an attack like this might originate from a small number of IP addresses and a customer might choose to block the source IPs completely. After blocking the IP addresses, customers may want to:</p><ul><li><p>Search through their Logs to see all the past instances of activity from those IP addresses.</p></li><li><p>Search through Logs from all their <i>other</i> applications and infrastructure to see all activity from those IP addresses</p></li><li><p>Understand exactly what that attacker was trying to do by looking at the request payload <a href=\"/encrypt-waf-payloads-hpke/\">blocked in our WAF</a> (securely encrypted thanks to HPKE!)</p></li><li><p>Set an alert for similar activity, to be notified if something similar happens again</p></li></ul><p>All these are made possible using SIEMs and infrastructure monitoring tools. For example, our customer <a href=\"https://www.nov.com/\">NOV</a> uses Splunk to “monitor our network and applications by alerting us to various anomalies and high-fidelity incidents&quot;.</p><p>“One of the most valuable sources of data is Cloudflare,” said John McLeod, Chief Information Security Officer at NOV. “It provides visibility into network and application attacks. With this integration, it will be easier to get Cloudflare Logs into Splunk, saving my team time and money.&quot;</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"a-new-ui-for-our-growing-product-base\">A new UI for our growing product base</h3>\n            <a href=\"#a-new-ui-for-our-growing-product-base\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>With so many new data sets and new destinations, we realized that our existing user interface was not good enough.
