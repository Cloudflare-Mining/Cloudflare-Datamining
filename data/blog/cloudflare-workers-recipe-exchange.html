	<p><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about">Cloudflare Workers</a> let you run JavaScript in Cloudflare’s hundreds of data centers around the world. Using a Worker, you can modify your site’s HTTP requests and responses, make parallel requests, or generate responses from the edge. Cloudflare Workers has been in open beta phase since February 1st. Read more about the launch in <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-is-now-on-open-beta">this blog post</a>.</p>
	<h4>What can you do with Cloudflare Workers?</h4>
	<p>Cloudflare has an incredibly powerful global network of 151 data centers, where you can put compute anywhere and you can write with a language you’re familiar with (JavaScript) with a standard API you're familiar with (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">Service Workers</a>). You can move your compute to be super low latency, to be much nearer to your end user, your database, your embedded device, or anything else you want faster round trips for.</p>
	<p>You may access and leverage the power of Cloudflare’s network for your next applications or as an add-on for optimizing the performance of your existing projects by running JavaScript on Cloudflare’s edge network.</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-acquires-eager">next</a> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/neumob-optimizing-mobile">product</a> that leverages Cloudflare's infrastructure to create security, performance, usability, and other optimizations for the Internet should have the lowest possible barriers to entry. Millions of customers should have access to those products on day one. That's how the Internet should work.</p>
