When we launched in beta, we set out to make a difference and provide the most <a href=\"/migrating-to-cloudflare-email-routing/\">uncomplicated</a>, more powerful <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email-routing/\">email forwarding service</a> on the Internet for all our customers, for free.</p><p>We feel we&#39;ve met and <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/em-cloudflare\">surpassed</a> our goals for the first year. Cloudflare Email Routing is now one of our most popular features and a top leading email provider. We are processing email traffic for more than 550,000 inboxes and forwarding an average of two million messages daily, and still growing month to month.</p><p>In February, we also announced that we were <a href=\"/why-we-are-acquiring-area-1/\">acquiring</a> Area1. Merging their team, products, and know-how with Cloudflare was a significant step in strengthening our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/\">Email Security</a> capabilities.</p><p>All this is good, but what about more features, you ask?</p><p>The team has been working hard to enhance Email Routing over the last few months. <b>Today Email Routing leaves beta.</b></p><p>Also, we feel that this could be a good time to give you an update on all the new things we&#39;ve been adding to the service, including behind-the-scenes and not-so-visible improvements.</p><p>Let’s get started.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"public-api-and-terraform\">Public API and Terraform</h3>\n            <a href=\"#public-api-and-terraform\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Cloudflare has a strong API-first philosophy.

A bad reputation goes away when the IP or domain stops acting bad.</p><p>Cloudflare is a security company that knows a few things about IP <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/#field-cf-threat_score\">threat scores</a> and reputation. Working with the Area1 team and learning from them, we added support to flag and block emails received from what we consider bad IPs at the SMTP level. Our approach uses a combination of heuristics and reputation databases, including some RBL lists, which we constantly update.</p><p>This measure benefits not only those customers that receive a lot of spam, who will now get another layer of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/protect-domains-without-email/\">protection</a> and filtering, but also everyone else using Email Routing. The reputation of our own IP space and forwarding domain, which we use to deliver messages to other email providers, will improve, and with it, so will our deliverability success rate.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"idn-support\">IDN support</h3>\n            <a href=\"#idn-support\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p><a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5891\">Internationalized domain names</a>, or IDNs for short, are domains that contain at least one non-ASCII character. To accommodate backward compatibility with older Internet protocols and applications, the IETF approved the IDNA protocol (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications), which was then adopted by <a href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/idn.md\">many browsers</a>, top-level domain registrars and other service providers.</p><p>Cloudflare was <a href=\"/non-latinutf8-domains-now-fully-supported/\">one of the first</a> platforms to adopt IDNs back in 2012.  Supporting internationalized domain names on email, though, is challenging. Email uses DNS, SMTP, and other standards (like TLS and DKIM signatures) stacked on top of each other. IDNA conversions need to work end to end, or something will break.</p><p>Email Routing didn’t support IDNs until now. Starting today, Email Routing can be used with IDNs and everything will work end to end as expected.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2w5ochqMtILwVjTYbA0Pb/e0cefc44b813ae66f0b1d6a4493f16d1/image3-10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1041\" height=\"846\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"8-bit-mime-transport\">8-bit MIME transport</h3>\n            <a href=\"#8-bit-mime-transport\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The SMTP protocol supports extensions since the <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2821\">RFC 2821</a> revision.

Think about it as programmable email.</p><p>The good news, though, is that we&#39;re near completing the project.
