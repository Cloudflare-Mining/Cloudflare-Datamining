When we launched in beta, we set out to make a difference and provide the most <a href=\"/migrating-to-cloudflare-email-routing/\">uncomplicated</a>, more powerful <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email-routing/\">email forwarding service</a> on the Internet for all our customers, for free.</p><p>We feel we&#39;ve met and <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/em-cloudflare\">surpassed</a> our goals for the first year. Cloudflare Email Routing is now one of our most popular features and a top leading email provider. We are processing email traffic for more than 550,000 inboxes and forwarding an average of two million messages daily, and still growing month to month.</p><p>In February, we also announced that we were <a href=\"/why-we-are-acquiring-area-1/\">acquiring</a> Area1. Merging their team, products, and know-how with Cloudflare was a significant step in strengthening our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/\">Email Security</a> capabilities.</p><p>All this is good, but what about more features, you ask?</p><p>The team has been working hard to enhance Email Routing over the last few months. <b>Today Email Routing leaves beta.</b></p><p>Also, we feel that this could be a good time to give you an update on all the new things we&#39;ve been adding to the service, including behind-the-scenes and not-so-visible improvements.</p><p>Let’s get started.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"public-api-and-terraform\">Public API and Terraform</h3>\n      <a href=\"#public-api-and-terraform\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare has a strong API-first philosophy. All of our services expose their primitives in our vast API catalog and gateway, which we then “dogfood” extensively. For instance, our customer&#39;s configuration dashboard is built entirely on top of these APIs.</p><p>The Email Routing APIs didn&#39;t quite make it to this catalog on day one and were kept private and undocumented for a while. This summer we made those APIs <a href=\"https://api.cloudflare.com/#email-routing-destination-addresses-properties\">available</a> on the public Cloudflare API catalog. You can programmatically use them to manage your destination emails, rules, and other Email Routing settings.

We added two widgets, Analytics and Detailed Logs, which will hopefully provide the needed <a href=\"/email-routing-insights/\">insights</a> and help increase visibility.</p><p>The Analytics section of Email Routing shows general statistics about the number of emails received during the selected timeframe, how they got handled to the upstream destination addresses, and a convenient time-series chart.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5idsdXSP16hDLOxayDOGqi/6b62d3ce039cdd9d94abc0e69405594f/image5-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1123\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>On the Activity Log, you can get detailed information about what happened to each individual message that was received and then delivered to the destination.

We also provide filters to help you find what you&#39;re looking for in case your message volume is higher.</p><p>More recently, the Activity Log now also shows <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_message\">bounces</a>. A bounce message happens when the upstream SMTP server accepts the delivery, but then, for any reason (exceeded quota, virus checks, forged messages, or other issues), the recipient inbox decides to reject it and return a new message back with an error to the latest <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent\">MTA</a> in the chain, read from the <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322.html#section-3.6.7\">Return-Path</a> headers, which is us.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7wyT0gd7l6GHjl7LVFjCUR/67628c835e2f8f76f0d6a16ef99011be/image8-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1043\" height=\"524\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"audit-logs\">Audit Logs</h3>\n      <a href=\"#audit-logs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-security/review-audit-logs/\">Audit Logs</a> are available on all plan types and summarize the history of events, like login and logout actions, or zone configuration changes, made within your Cloudflare account.

They affect the user experience and efficiency of email, and often carry security risks that can lead to scams, identity theft, and manipulation.</p><p>Since day one, we have supported and validated <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/\">SPF</a> (Sender Policy Framework) records,  <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/\">DKIM</a> (DomainKeys Identified Mail) signatures, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dmarc-record/\">DMARC</a> (Domain-based Message Authentication) policies in incoming messages. These steps are important and mitigate some risks associated with authenticating the origin of an email from a specific legitimate domain, but they don&#39;t solve the problem completely. You can still have bad actors generating spam or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/how-to-identify-a-phishing-email/\">phishing</a> Attacks from other domains who ignore SPF or DKIM completely.</p><p>Anti-spam techniques today are often based on blocking emails whose origin (the IP address of the client trying to deliver the message) confidence score isn&#39;t great. This is commonly known in the industry as IP reputation. Other companies specialize in maintaining reputation lists for IPs and email domains, also known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System-based_blocklist\">RBL</a> lists, which are then shared across providers and used widely.</p><p>Simply put, an IP or a domain gets a bad reputation when it starts sending unsolicited or malicious emails. If your IP or domain has a bad reputation, you&#39;ll have a hard time delivering Emails from them to any major email provider. A bad reputation goes away when the IP or domain stops acting bad.</p><p>Cloudflare is a security company that knows a few things about IP <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/#field-cf-threat_score\">threat scores</a> and reputation. Working with the Area1 team and learning from them, we added support to flag and block emails received from what we consider bad IPs at the SMTP level. Our approach uses a combination of heuristics and reputation databases, including some RBL lists, which we constantly update.</p><p>This measure benefits not only those customers that receive a lot of spam, who will now get another layer of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/protect-domains-without-email/\">protection</a> and filtering, but also everyone else using Email Routing. The reputation of our own IP space and forwarding domain, which we use to deliver messages to other email providers, will improve, and with it, so will our deliverability success rate.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"idn-support\">IDN support</h3>\n      <a href=\"#idn-support\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5891\">Internationalized domain names</a>, or IDNs for short, are domains that contain at least one non-ASCII character. To accommodate backward compatibility with older Internet protocols and applications, the IETF approved the IDNA protocol (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications), which was then adopted by <a href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/idn.md\">many browsers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name-registrar/\">top-level domain registrars</a> and other service providers.</p><p>Cloudflare was <a href=\"/non-latinutf8-domains-now-fully-supported/\">one of the first</a> platforms to adopt IDNs back in 2012.  Supporting internationalized domain names on email, though, is challenging. Email uses DNS, SMTP, and other standards (like TLS and DKIM signatures) stacked on top of each other. IDNA conversions need to work end to end, or something will break.</p><p>Email Routing didn’t support IDNs until now.
