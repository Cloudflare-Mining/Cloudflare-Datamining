This includes increased automation of outage detection, enabling us to publish more timely information through both the API and the CROC tool, which is important for members of the community that track and respond to Internet outages. We are also exploring how we can use synthetic monitoring in combination with other network-level performance and availability information to detect outages of popular consumer and business applications/platforms.</p><p>And anyone who uses a cloud platform provider (such as AWS) will know that those companies&#39; status pages take a surprisingly long time to update when there&#39;s an outage. It&#39;s very common to experience difficulty accessing a service, see hundreds of messages on Twitter and message boards about a service being down, only to go to the cloud platform provider&#39;s status page and see everything green and &quot;All systems normal&quot;.</p><p>For the last few months we&#39;ve been monitoring the performance of cloud platform providers to see if we can detect when they go down and provide our own, real time status page for them. We believe we can and Cloudflare Radar Outage Center will be extended to include cloud service providers and give the Internet the status page it needs.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/ElQVyUehH38WAASO5onPs/6b2bd6318445b976c9f444af4e730ab2/image2-69.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1376\" height=\"568\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>If you have questions about the CROC, or suggestions for features that you would like to see, please reach out to us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/\">@CloudflareRadar</a>.</p>",
