Launched publicly at TechCrunch Disrupt – NYC in May 2011, CodeGuard provides cloud backup for websites, in addition to monitory and undo/restorecapability.</p><p>We sat down with David at HostingCon (and started a friendly Nerf war with his staff) to find out what CodeGuard is up to these days.</p><p>&quot;CodeGuard is a daily, automatic website backup tool,&quot; said David. &quot;For anyone who has a website on a shared host or VPS dedicated, who has access, we do FTP, SFTP, MySQL and WordPress backup.&quot;</p><p>CodeGuard gives website owners the tools to easily fix hacks and revert changes, allowing website owners to turn back time on any damage done to their site.</p><p>&quot;We provide a time machine for websites,&quot; said David.</p><p>CodeGuard has many different types of customers, including lawyers, doctors, florists and fitness experts.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s really a mix of anyone who has a website, but they don&#39;t have full-time web IT staff,&quot; said David.</p><p>In a sense, CodeGuard is like the superhero for these website owners who don&#39;t have the capabilities or staff to run their sites or fix problems that occur.</p><p>&quot;We came out of the gates thinking people would really want us because they are so scared of being hacked and wanting to fix it and roll back, but what we&#39;ve found is that people really enjoy us for just having a tool to manage this asset they have, which is their content,&quot; said David.</p><p><i>At HostingCon 2012, </i><a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/\"><i>CloudFlare</i></a><i> co-founder </i><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/zatlyn\"><i>Michelle Zatlyn</i></a><i> sat down with 28 leading experts in the hosting industry.
