In drafting the eventual United Nations (UN) Charter, the delegates included seven mentions of the need for a set of formal, universal rights that would provide basic protections for all people, everywhere.</p><p>Although human rights have traditionally been the purview of nation-states, in 2005 the UN Secretary-General appointed Harvard Professor John Ruggie as the first Special Representative for Business and Human Rights. Ruggie was tasked with determining whether businesses, particularly multinational corporations operating in many jurisdictions, ought to have their own unique obligations under international human rights law.</p><p>In 2008, Ruggie proposed the &quot;Protect, Respect and Remedy&quot; framework on business and human rights to the UN Human Rights Council. He argued that while states have an <i>obligation</i> to <i>protect</i> human rights, businesses have a <i>responsibility</i> to <i>respect</i> human rights. Essentially, businesses should act with due diligence in all of their operations to avoid infringing on the rights of others, and remedy any harms that do occur. Moreover, businesses&#39; responsibilities exist independent of any state&#39;s ability or willingness to meet their own human rights obligations.</p><p>Ruggie&#39;s framework was later incorporated into the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf\">UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a>, which was unanimously endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"cloudflare-human-rights\">Cloudflare + Human Rights</h3>\n      <a href=\"#cloudflare-human-rights\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>With Cloudflare&#39;s network now operating in more than 100 countries, with more than a billion unique IP addresses passing through Cloudflare&#39;s network every day, we believe we have a significant responsibility to respect, and a tremendous potential to promote, human rights.</p><p>For example, privacy is a protected human right under Article 17 of the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx\">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, which means that the law enforcement and other government orders we periodically receive to access customer&#39;s personal information affect the human rights of our customers and users. Twice a year, we publish a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/transparency/\">Transparency Report</a> that describes exactly how many orders, subpoenas, and warrants we receive, how we respond, and how many customers or domains are affected.</p><p>In responding to law enforcement requests for subscriber information, Cloudflare has relied on three principles: due process, respect for our customer&#39;s privacy, and notice for those affected. As we say often, Cloudflare&#39;s intent is to follow the law, and not to make law enforcement&#39;s job any harder, or easier.</p><p>However, as Cloudflare expands internationally, relying on due process and transparency alone may not always be sufficient. For one thing, those kinds of protections are dependent on good-faith implementation of legal processes like rule of law and judicial oversight. They also require a government and legal system that carries some political legitimacy, like those established through democratic processes.  </p><p>To improve the consistency of how we work with governments around the world, Cloudflare will be incorporating human rights training and due diligence tools like human rights impact assessments into our decision-making processes throughout our company.  </p><p>We recognize that as a company there are limits to what Cloudflare can or should do as we operate around the world. But we are committed to more formally documenting our efforts to respect human rights under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and we&#39;ve partnered with GNI to help us get there.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/pxxVexY4X8YAnDx3eEmTP/5dba449e34b98ccb93ccc1323d497e8b/Web-Top-copy-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"300\" height=\"141\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"who-is-gni\">Who is GNI?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#who-is-gni\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>GNI is a non-profit organization launched in 2008.
