The initial launch opened up 150 physical locations alongside 25 global partner locations. During Security Week this year, we grew that availability by <a href=\"/network-onramp-partnerships/\">adding data center partners</a> to our CNI Partner Program. Today, we are adding even more connectivity options by expanding Cloudflare availability to <b>all</b> of our partners’ locations, as well as welcoming <a href=\"https://www.coresite.com/cloud-services/open-cloud-exchange\">CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange (OCX</a>) and <a href=\"https://epsilontel.com/infiny/\">Infiny by Epsilon</a> into our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect-partnerships/\">CNI Partner Program</a>. This totals 1,638 locations where our customers can now connect securely to the Cloudflare network.
