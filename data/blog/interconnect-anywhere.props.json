In the past, we’ve talked about Cloudflare’s physical footprint in over 200+ data centers, and how Cloudflare Network Interconnect enabled companies <i>in those data centers</i> to connect securely to Cloudflare’s network. Today, Cloudflare is excited to announce expanded partnerships that allows customers to connect to Cloudflare from their own Layer 2 service fabric. There are now over 1,600 locations where enterprise security and network professionals have the option to connect to Cloudflare securely and privately from their existing fabric.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"interconnect-anywhere-is-a-journey\">Interconnect Anywhere is a journey</h2>\n            <a href=\"#interconnect-anywhere-is-a-journey\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Since we <a href=\"/cloudflare-network-interconnect/\">launched Cloudflare Network Interconnect</a> (CNI) in August 2020, we’ve been focused on extending the availability of Cloudflare’s network to as many places as possible. The initial launch opened up 150 physical locations alongside 25 global partner locations. During Security Week this year, we grew that availability by <a href=\"/network-onramp-partnerships/\">adding data center partners</a> to our CNI Partner Program. Today, we are adding even more connectivity options by expanding Cloudflare availability to <b>all</b> of our partners’ locations, as well as welcoming <a href=\"https://www.coresite.com/cloud-services/open-cloud-exchange\">CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange (OCX</a>) and <a href=\"https://epsilontel.com/infiny/\">Infiny by Epsilon</a> into our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect-partnerships/\">CNI Partner Program</a>. This totals 1,638 locations where our customers can now connect securely to the Cloudflare network.
