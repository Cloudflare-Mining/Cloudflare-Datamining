The results showed that on a range of tests (TCP connection time, time to first byte, time to last byte), and on a range of measurements (p95, mean), that Cloudflare was the fastest provider in 49% of networks around the world. Since then, we’ve worked to continuously improve performance until we’re the fastest everywhere. <a href=\"/two-weeks-later-finding-and-eliminating-long-tail-latencies/\">We set a goal</a> to grow the number of networks where we’re the fastest by 10% every Innovation Week. We met that goal during <a href=\"/tag/birthday-week/\">Birthday Week</a> (September 2021).</p><p>Today, we’re proud to report we blew the goal away for <a href=\"/tag/full-stack-week/\">Full Stack Week</a> (November 2021). Cloudflare measured our performance against the top 1,000 networks in the world (by number of IPv4 addresses advertised). Out of those, Cloudflare has become the fastest provider in 79 new networks, an increase of 14% of these 1,000 networks. Of course, we’re not done yet, but we wanted to share the latest results and explain how we did it.</p><p>However, before we go into more detail on our network performance, we wanted to share new performance metrics on our Workers platform (given it’s Full Stack Week!). We’ve crunched the numbers of Cloudflare Workers vs Fastly’s Compute@Edge, and the results are in: Workers is 196% faster.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"faster-network-means-faster-stack\">Faster Network Means Faster Stack</h3>\n            <a href=\"#faster-network-means-faster-stack\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>A few months ago, we also discussed the performance of Cloudflare Workers, as compared to other similar offerings out there.

We used Real User Measurements (RUM) to fetch a 100kb file from several different providers. Users around the world report the performance of different providers.  The more users who report the data, the higher fidelity the signal is.  The goal is to provide an accurate picture of where different providers are faster, and more importantly, where Cloudflare can improve. You can read more about the methodology in the <a href=\"/benchmarking-edge-network-performance/\">original Speed Week blog post here</a>.</p><p>In the process of quantifying network performance, it became clear where we were not the fastest everywhere. After Birthday Week, we found 601 country/network pairs where we were more than 100ms behind the leading provider (where a country/network pair is defined as the performance of a network within a particular country).</p><p>We are constantly going through the process of figuring out <i>why</i> we were slow — and then improve. The challenges we faced were unique to each network and highlighted a variety of different issues that are prevalent on the Internet. We’re going to deep dive into a couple of networks, and show how we diagnosed and then improved performance.</p><p>But before we do, here are the results of our efforts in the past two weeks.</p><p>Cloudflare has become number one in TCP Connection Time in 79 new networks.

We observed that a lot of users in Lima were actually getting sent to Chile to be served. Cloudflare has multiple locations in Peru, so this shouldn’t have happened. Sending traffic to Chile caused us to be ranked fourth on that particular network in the country. Our engineers knew that the best way to get to number one was to ensure that all the Lima traffic stayed within the country, so we decided to look at why so much of our traffic was getting routed outside the country.</p><p>The reason that so much traffic was being routed outside the country was due to the network provider distributing traffic to Cloudflare unevenly, and too many users were sent to one specific location. Our network has a series of checks and fail-safes that allow us to ensure that even if this happens, our users will continue to see a good experience. The checks were being engaged here because of the uneven distribution of traffic to our locations in Lima; however, the traffic was being sent out of the country.</p><p>To fix the situation in the short term, we decided to do a bit of manual load balancing across our locations in Lima while building automation to remove the need for manual actions in the future. We took one of the locations that was seeing the most traffic and stopped advertising some prefixes from that location. The hypothesis we had was that the traffic would simply flow to the other Lima locations instead of Chile, and everything would balance out, improving the TCP connect time for everyone while keeping the traffic in the country. We started to make the change on a small portion of our free traffic, and our hypothesis  proved correct.  At that point, we deployed the change in a larger scope, and the P90 Client TCP <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/round-trip-time-rtt/\">RTT</a> dropped from 240ms to 60ms.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/lJMJWt9GicVaI50GyVVEc/c644fc6df6289bcf51a1b478dd8b5cd1/image14-9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"906\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As a result, Cloudflare is now number one in network performance in Peru.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"slimming-down-latencies-in-sri-lanka\">Slimming Down Latencies in Sri Lanka</h3>\n            <a href=\"#slimming-down-latencies-in-sri-lanka\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Our next example takes us halfway around the world to Sri Lanka, where we found a network provider who was routing requests from their users to Newark.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">1 * * *\n2 100.85.0.1 3.061ms 2.522ms 2.728ms\n3 198.51.100.146 AS29766 3.651ms 1.855ms 2.715ms\n4 198.51.100.145 AS29766 3.438ms 3.225ms 2.805ms\n5 222.165.177.150 AS9329 2.233ms 2.272ms 2.843ms\n6 222.165.177.145 AS9329 2.703ms 2.862ms 2.291ms\n7 103.87.125.253 AS45489 3.658ms 3.708ms 3.613ms\n8 103.87.124.245 AS45489 120.027ms 120.665ms 120.471ms\n9 103.87.124.146 AS45489 115.597ms 115.863ms 115.178ms\n10 50.208.235.157 be-107-2008-pe01.60hudson.ny.ibone.comcast.net AS7922 249.884ms 249.475ms 250.063ms -&gt; going from Sri Lanka to New York\n11 96.110.41.145 be-4101-cs01.newyork.ny.ibone.comcast.net AS7922 267.839ms 267.979ms 268.719ms\n12 96.110.34.34 be-3112-pe12.111eighthave.ny.ibone.comcast.net AS7922 262.647ms 261.272ms 262.272ms\n13 66.208.233.106 AS7922 262.378ms 258.948ms 258.057ms\n14 172.70.108.4 AS13335 268.974ms 280.475ms 268.158ms\n15 172.67.182.209 AS13335 267.329ms 266.466ms 266.593ms</pre></code>\n            <p>This understandably caused significant latency problems, and Cloudflare was ranked fourth in Sri Lanka on this network as a result.
