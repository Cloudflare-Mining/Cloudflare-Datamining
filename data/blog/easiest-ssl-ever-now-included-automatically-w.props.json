While it&#39;s something every website <i>should</i> support, even for the technically savvy, getting a SSL certificate properly installed on your web server can be daunting. Moreover, several platforms like Google AppEngine don&#39;t fully support SSL so it&#39;s not a possibility. Up until now CloudFlare, unfortunately, didn&#39;t make it any easier.</p><p>The way SSL worked on CloudFlare in the past was that you had to upgrade to a PRO account, select the subdomains that you wanted to have SSL on, pay us $1/month for each of those subdomains, and then pick an email address that was either a valid role account (like <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@domain.com\">webmaster@domain.com</a>) or included in the whois record to which our certificate authority partner could send a vetting email. That began a complicated process that, in the best case, would have SSL working across our network about 2 hours later. In the worst case, it could take days. And none of that removed you having to buy a certificate and install it on your site.</p><p>We knew there was a better way and for the last 6 months we&#39;ve been working on it with Globalsign, our certificate authority partner, to build it. I think we&#39;ve finally nailed it. SSL is now included automatically with every paid CloudFlare account at no additional cost. If you&#39;re a paid user, you now have SSL on your site automatically. If you were paying before, we&#39;ve removed the SSL charge from your future bill. You don&#39;t need to pick the subdomains (it&#39;ll work on any subdomains that are marked as &quot;CloudFlare enabled&quot;) and you don&#39;t need to wait around for a vetting email.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3ZKYztdDy966ZZArZKp8QL/6e9f5b1f8343eb0de8547fc77ccd4b82/ssl_options.png.scaled500.png\" alt=\"Easiest SSL Ever, Now Included Automatically with Every Paid Plan\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"302\" height=\"277\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>What&#39;s cool is even if you didn&#39;t previously have SSL now you do. To make this happen, we&#39;re introducing a &quot;flexible&quot; SSL mode which will encrypt traffic from your visitors to CloudFlare&#39;s network, protecting your visitors from the most common types of eavesdropping and attacks like FireSheep. What&#39;s awesome is this allows you to run SSL in front of services where you can&#39;t install a certificate. It literally makes SSL one-click easy.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6KxlMrPHaGloXrLPd68Kbv/fc0c5854258dcb7d8afe385482453b6b/ssl_settings_panel.png.scaled500.png\" alt=\"Easiest SSL Ever, Now Included Automatically with Every Paid Plan\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"66\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>If you&#39;re a paid CloudFlare user, you&#39;re already setup -- even if you didn&#39;t have SSL before. Give it a try by visiting the HTTPS version of your site. We&#39;ve intelligently defaulted you to flexible or end-to-end mode depending on what your backend server supports. You can override the default, or turn SSL off if you don&#39;t want it for some reason, from your CloudFlare Settings page.</p><p>We&#39;re going to be rolling out some more options to make SSL even more wide spread in the coming weeks. It&#39;s all part of our mission to make a faster, safer Internet.</p>",
