Preserving end-user privacy is <a href=\"/internet-privacy\">core to our mission</a> of helping to build a better Internet; we’ve never sold personal data about customers or end users of our network. We comply with laws like GDPR and maintain certifications such as ISO-27001.</p><p>Today, we&#39;re announcing tools that make it simple for our customers to build the same rigor into their own applications. In this post, I&#39;ll explain the different types of data that we process and how the Data Localization Suite keeps this data local.</p><p>We’ll also talk about how Cloudflare makes it possible to build applications that comply with data locality laws, while remaining fast, secure and scalable.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"why-keep-data-local\">Why keep data local?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#why-keep-data-local\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare&#39;s customers have increasing desire or face legal requirements for data <i>locality</i>: they want to control the geographic location where their data is handled. Many categories of data that our customers process (including healthcare, legal, or financial data) may be subject to obligations that specify the data be stored or processed in a specific location. The preference or requirement for data localization is growing across jurisdictions such as the EU, India, and Brazil; over time, we expect more customers in more places will be expected to keep data local.</p><p>Although “data locality” sounds like a simple concept, our conversations with Cloudflare customers make clear that there are a number of unique challenges they face in the attempt to move toward this goal.  The availability of information on their Internet properties will remain global--they don’t want to limit access to their websites to local jurisdictions--but they want to make sure data stays local. Variously, they are trying to figure out:</p><ul><li><p>How do I build local requirements into my global online operations?</p></li><li><p>How do I make sure unencrypted traffic is only available locally?</p></li><li><p>How do I make sure personal data is handled according to localization obligations?</p></li><li><p>How do I make sure my applications only store data in certain locations?</p></li></ul><p>The Cloudflare Data Localization Suite attempts to respond to these questions.</p><p>Until now, customers who wanted to localize their data had to choose to restrict their application to one data center, or to one cloud provider&#39;s region. This is a fragile approach, fraught with performance, reliability, and security challenges. Cloudflare is creating a new paradigm: customers should be able to get the performance and security benefits of our global network, while effortlessly keeping their data local.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"encryption-is-the-backbone-of-privacy\">Encryption is the backbone of privacy</h3>\n      <a href=\"#encryption-is-the-backbone-of-privacy\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Before we go into data locality, we should discuss encryption. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-data-privacy/\">Privacy</a> isn&#39;t possible without strong encryption; otherwise, anyone could snoop your customers&#39; data, regardless of where it&#39;s stored.</p><p>Data is often described as being &quot;in transit&quot; and &quot;at rest&quot;. It&#39;s critically important that both are encrypted. Data &quot;in transit&quot; refers to just that—data while it&#39;s moving about on the wire, whether a local network or the public Internet. &quot;At rest&quot; generally means stored on a disk somewhere, whether a spinning HDD or a modern SSD.</p><p>In transit, Cloudflare can enforce that all traffic to end-users uses modern TLS and gets the highest level of encryption possible. We can also enforce that all traffic back to customers&#39; origin servers is always encrypted. Communication between all our edge and core data centers is always encrypted.</p><p>Cloudflare encrypts all of the data we handle at rest, usually with disk-level encryption. From <a href=\"/speeding-up-linux-disk-encryption/\">cached files</a> on our edge network, to configuration state in databases in our core data centers—every byte is encrypted at rest.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"control-where-tls-private-keys-can-be-accessed\">Control where TLS private keys can be accessed</h3>\n      <a href=\"#control-where-tls-private-keys-can-be-accessed\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Given the importance of encryption, one of the most sensitive pieces of data that our customers trust us to protect are their cryptographic keys, which enable data to be decrypted. Cloudflare offers two ways for customers to ensure that their private keys are only accessible in locations they specify.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/keyless-ssl/\"><b>Keyless SSL</b></a> allows a customer to store and manage their own SSL private keys for use with Cloudflare on any external infrastructure of their choosing. Customers can use a variety of systems for their keystore, including hardware security modules (“HSMs”), virtual servers, and hardware running Unix/Linux and Windows that is housed in environments customers control. Cloudflare never has access to the private key with Keyless SSL.</p><p><a href=\"/geo-key-manager-how-it-works/\"><b>Geo Key Manager</b></a> gives customers granular control over which locations should store their keys. For example, a customer can choose for the private keys required for inspection of traffic to only be accessible inside data centers located in the European Union.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"manage-where-https-requests-and-responses-are-inspected\">Manage where HTTPS requests and responses are inspected</h3>\n      <a href=\"#manage-where-https-requests-and-responses-are-inspected\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In order to deploy our WAF, or detect malicious bot traffic, Cloudflare must terminate TLS in our edge data centers and inspect HTTPS request and response payloads.</p><p><a href=\"/introducing-regional-services/\"><b>Regional Services</b></a> gives organizations control over where their traffic is inspected.
