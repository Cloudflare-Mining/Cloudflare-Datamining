	<p>CloudFlare runs one of the largest networks of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/dns" target="_blank">DNS servers</a> in the world. Over the last few months, we've invested in making our DNS as fast and responsive as possible. We were happy to see these efforts pay off in third-party DNS test results.</p>
	<p>The good folks at SolveDNS conduct a <a href="http://www.solvedns.com/dns-comparison/2012/12" target="_blank">monthly survey</a> of the fastest DNS providers in the world. CloudFlare has regularly been in the top-5 fastest DNS providers. This month we're up to number two, with SolveDNS's tests showing an average 4.51ms response time. That's just a hair behind number one (at 4.38ms) and almost twice as fast as number three (at 8.85ms). And, unlike most the other DNS providers in the top-10, CloudFlare's fast <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-brief-anycast-primer">Anycast DNS</a> service is provided even for our free plans.</p>
	<p>Lest you think we're resting on our laurels, we've got a major DNS release (which we've dubbed RRDNS) scheduled for the next few months that we think will allow us to squeeze a bit more speed out of our DNS lookups. We're shooting for number one!</p>
