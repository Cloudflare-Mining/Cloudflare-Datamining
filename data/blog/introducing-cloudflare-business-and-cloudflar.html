	<p>Over the last 18 months, the CloudFlare team has been busy building massive scale across hundreds of thousands of websites. As our <a href="https://cloudflare.com/network-map">network</a> continues to grow, it becomes smarter, giving us insight into <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/how-to-secure-a-website">website security</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization">performance</a> that no other company has.</p>
	<p>Thanks to the knowledge gained from this massive scale, and to all of our customers who have joined the CloudFlare network, we are now able to provide a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security">performance and security solution</a> for businesses and enterprises that is unlike anything else on the market. We are very excited to announce our newest tiers of service: CloudFlare Business and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise">CloudFlare Enterprise</a>.</p>

	<p>Rest assured if you are a current CloudFlare user who loves our existing service, things are only going to get better. This week, we've also added new image optimization features to our Pro service (<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-mirage-intelligent-image-loading">Mirage</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-polish-automatic-image-optimizati">Polish</a>). As CloudAve tweeted this morning, these two web performance features alone make upgrading to CloudFlare Pro a "no brainer."</p>
	<p>We will continue to invest in our existing Free and Pro plans. We are 100% committed to always provide a free service with at least the feature set that it has today. Over time,some of the features that are part of paid plans will migrate down into the free service. All our customers, at any level, will benefit from our ongoing network expansion (and we'll have big things to announce on that front shortly) as we continue to make the Internet a faster, safer, better place for everyone.</p>
	<p>If you're interested in our new tiers of service, visit our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/business">CloudFlare Business &amp; Enterprise page</a> or signup on our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans">new plans page</a> which contains full details comparing CloudFlare different service options.</p>
