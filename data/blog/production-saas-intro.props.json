But, as comprehensive as it is, new users to the Cloudflare Workers platform must bridge a large gap to go from the introductory example snippets to a real, production-ready application. While some of this may be specific to Workers (as with any platform), developers <i>everywhere</i> are figuring out how applications should be built in a serverless world. Building large serverless applications entails a learning curve journey, regardless of a developer’s experience level.</p><p>At Cloudflare, we’re intimately aware of this because we also had to go through the same transition. Our engineers are world-class and expertfully design and craft products that complement the distributed paradigm… but experts aren’t born overnight! We have been there, and we want to help jumpstart and aid others’ understanding.</p><p>With this in mind, we decided to do something unique to the industry: we are developing an example feature-complete SaaS application that will be built entirely on the Cloudflare stack. It is and will continue to be completely free, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/production-saas\">open-sourced on GitHub</a>, and developed in public. This will be an incredible time as it can be used as a template for launching your own SaaS applications, too! In fact, you can clone the GitHub repository, update a few service tokens, and deploy the pre-built application to your own Cloudflare account within minutes!</p><p>Of course, examples and templates are great, but technologies and best practices never stop evolving. Cloudflare is no exception and is constantly iterating and introducing new products and product features. By extension, this requires the SaaS application to be a <i>living example</i> that evolves alongside the Workers platform — and this is part of our commitment.</p><p>|| <b>Don’t miss out!</b> Watch the <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/production-saas\">project on GitHub</a> to track its development progress and stay current with our latest changes and recommendations.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"application-overview\">Application Overview</h2>\n            <a href=\"#application-overview\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Now, aside from actually building the application, we needed to find a balance between picking an example SaaS application that is both complex enough to serve as a convincing case study and simple — or self-contained — enough so that developers can quickly dive in, follow the source, and understand the components involved and the reasons why and/or how they are used.</p><p>Ultimately we decided to build an example content management system (CMS) which, as an application archetype, has also transformed over the years. Traditionally, a CMS operated on rented hardware, which was home to a long-lived server that handled incoming requests and queried an SQL-like database in order to retrieve the requested content, render it to an HTML page, and repeat the process over and over again. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> was — and still is — a very common example of this approach.</p><p>Naturally, this application architecture was improved over the years: layers of caching were introduced, database schemas were redesigned to minimize the number of rows processed, and some frameworks began to skip the database entirely, preferring a build-step to render all content upfront as static HTML pages. (This is now known as “static-site generation” and is still a very popular approach.)</p><p>Today, in the serverless era, there are a number of “headless CMS” options available. These are made “headless” because they are not monolithic web servers that render HTML for each request. Instead, they offer API endpoints that will return the content as raw JSON data. This allows web developers to build completely custom templates for their website using whatever tools and/or frameworks they prefer. This approach grants an enormous amount of flexibility to the developer without losing the ability to organize their content, image assets, etc. WordPress, the seasoned veteran, is one of few that is able to offer a headless <i>and</i> a “headful” mode. Other headless choices, like <a href=\"https://www.sanity.io/\">Sanity.io</a> and <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/\">Contentful</a>, are also quite popular.</p><p>The CMS application model is a great case study for our open-source example. One of the primary tenets of an edge-first design is that content should be made available as close as physically possible to the users asking for it. And the serverless architecture means that there’s no longer — or should not be — a single point of failure. These both directly benefit the CMS archetype and, when implemented, will yield clear performance gains.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"current-progress\">Current Progress</h2>\n            <a href=\"#current-progress\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Before diving into the roadmap and explaining how this project will progress, it’s important to call out that this project <i>has already been</i> — and will continue to be — an ongoing effort!

Using Workers and Workers KV, the work within this milestone will focus on building a robust JSON API that handles the core functionality that the rest of the application will need.</p><p>There is no HTML, CSS, or client-side JavaScript involved in this phase. Instead, work here should focus solely on the data: how it’s accessed, how models relate to one another, and how best to structure and store these relationships within Workers KV. For example, individuals should be able to create and manage workspaces that belong to their personal user accounts or to the organization(s) that they belong to.</p><p>Additionally, when creating content, the document should be validated against an existing schema that the document was assigned. This feature is critical in any CMS platform that plans to handle thousands of documents within a workspace. Without it, there’s very little confidence that your contents’ JSON representation is consistently structured.</p><p>A number of other features are planned — subscription management and invoicing through <a href=\"https://stripe.com/\">Stripe</a>, sending transactional emails through <a href=\"https://sendgrid.com/\">SendGrid</a>, and assigning vanity domains to workspaces through <a href=\"/cloudflare-for-saas-for-all-now-generally-available/\">Cloudflare for SaaS</a>. Finally, of course, the standard house-keeping tasks will be set up.

And, because we started with the JSON API, the project is immediately useful and capable of integrating with your existing build tools and frameworks. In other words, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/production-saas\">stargazers</a> could deploy the project to their own accounts as their own personalized Headless CMS.

This phase will be all about assembling a frontend to serve as the CMS application’s dashboard.</p><p>We will use <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a>, a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. While not everyone may enjoy or agree with this decision, the templating syntax resembles standard HTML markup, which will allow non-frontend developers to follow along and gauge what’s going on.</p><p>Svelte will be paired with <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">Tailwind CSS</a> for the design system. Tailwind is a very popular, utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to compose styles through predefined, reusable HTML <code>”class”</code> names.</p><p>The result will be a single-page application (SPA) and will be hosted on Cloudflare Pages. This means that, out of the box, the dashboard will be able to take advantage of <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/preview-deployments#customizing-preview-deployments-access\">Access-protected preview deployments</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/rollbacks\">instant rollbacks</a>, automated deployments, comprehensive analytics, and more.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7tr1PMuybglLESZjeCxqvS/a70bcb61404070f60a1a93fb83ab1039/image1-53.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1156\" height=\"698\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Finally, <a href=\"/cloudflare-pages-goes-full-stack/\">now that Pages integrates with Workers directly</a>, the JSON API from <b>Phase 1</b> will migrate into a new repository structure. While this may seem like an innocent refactor, it actually unlocks an incredible set of features for the JSON API: <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/preview-deployments#customizing-preview-deployments-access\">Access-protected preview deployments</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/rollbacks\">instant rollbacks</a>, and automated deployments. Yes — these are the same Pages features mentioned above! This is amazing because it means that our API is continuously and atomically versioned, allowing its development to continue safely <i>alongside</i> the client dashboard that depends on it. In other words, there is zero risk of the API and the dashboard diverging, which would have allowed their expectations of one another to misalign. Instant rollbacks will also apply to the API since the <i>entire</i> application operates as a single Pages unit.</p><p>The previous phase will have built the core SaaS product functionality, but completing this phase will make it feel like a real-world product that can be launched and used on a daily basis.

Should they opt for HTML output, the Cloudflare project will only include a few premade templates that a user may select from — but, of course, this can be customized in your own projects.</p><p>Even though this phase reintroduces the monolithic CMS archetype, it’s a significantly safer, faster, and more resilient architecture than the single, all-in-one server of yesteryear. The CMS contents will still be distributed around the world, close to the customers’ readers — but now, the content can be <i>rendered</i> from anywhere in the world at extremely low latencies, too.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"phase-4-feature-upgrades\">Phase 4 — Feature Upgrades</h3>\n            <a href=\"#phase-4-feature-upgrades\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>At this stage, the application is — for the most part — complete. It’s functional, looks nice, performs well globally, and can be used in two very distinct ways.</p><p>In the context of a real SaaS product, development begins to shift towards adding new features that excite users or towards maintenance health of the project. For example, <b>Phase 4</b> will utilize <a href=\"/durable-objects-ga/\">Durable Objects</a> to introduce a document editor that allows multiple users to edit the same document in a real-time, collaborative environment.</p><p>It’s also very likely that <a href=\"/introducing-r2-object-storage/\">Cloudflare R2 Storage</a> will be introduced as a backend for media assets, allowing users to upload and manage images within a workspace. Or perhaps we decide to use <a href=\"/announcing-cloudflare-images/\">Cloudflare Images</a> for this and R2 is used for importing and exporting content backups.</p><p>As you may expect, this milestone is full of unknowns, but that’s because the future holds unlimited possibilities. The project will continue to evolve and expand with Cloudflare and with time.</p><p>Of course, if you have ideas or suggestions for features, start a discussion with us on GitHub. We would love to hear from you!</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next Steps</h2>\n            <a href=\"#next-steps\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>This was the introductory post of (what will be) an ongoing series.
