At the start of this year, we brought this experience to Workers developers by <a href=\"/miniflare/\">launching Miniflare 2.0</a>: a local Cloudflare Workers simulator. Miniflare 2 came with features like step-through debugging support, detailed <code>console.log</code>s, pretty <a href=\"https://miniflare.dev/developing/source-maps\">source-mapped</a> error pages, <a href=\"https://miniflare.dev/developing/live-reload\">live reload</a> and a highly-configurable <a href=\"https://miniflare.dev/testing/jest\">unit testing environment</a>. Not only that, but we also incorporated Miniflare into Wrangler, our Workers CLI, to enable <code>wrangler dev</code>’s --<code>local</code> mode.</p><p>Today, we’re taking local development to the next level! In addition to introducing new support for migrating existing projects to your local development environment, we&#39;re making it easier to work with your remote data—locally! Most importantly, we&#39;re releasing a much more accurate Miniflare 3, powered by the <a href=\"/workerd-open-source-workers-runtime/\">recently open-sourced <code>workerd</code> runtime</a>—the same runtime used by Cloudflare Workers!</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"enabling-local-development-with-workerd\">Enabling local development with workerd</h3>\n            <a href=\"#enabling-local-development-with-workerd\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>One of the superpowers of having a local development environment is that you can test changes without affecting users in production. A great local environment offers a level of fidelity on par with production.</p><p>The way we originally approached local development was with Miniflare 2, which reimplemented Workers runtime APIs in JavaScript. Unfortunately, there were <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22behaviour+mismatch%22\">subtle behavior mismatches</a> between these re-implementations and the real Workers runtime. These types of issues are really difficult for developers to debug, as they don’t appear locally, and step-through debugging of deployed Workers isn’t possible yet. For example, the following Worker returns responses successfully in Miniflare 2, so we might assume it’s safe to publish:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-ts\"><code class=\"language-ts\">let cachedResponsePromise;\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {\n    // Let&#039;s imagine this fetch takes a few seconds. To speed up our worker, we\n    // decide to only fetch on the first request, and reuse the result later.\n    // This works fine in Miniflare 2, so we must be good right?\n    cachedResponsePromise ??= fetch(&quot;https://example.com&quot;);\n    return (await cachedResponsePromise).clone();\n  },\n};</pre></code>\n            <p>However, as soon as we send multiple requests to our deployed Worker, it fails with <code>Error: Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request</code>. The problem here is that response bodies created in one request’s handler cannot be accessed from a different request&#39;s handler. This limitation allows Cloudflare to improve overall Worker performance, but it was almost impossible for Miniflare 2 to detect these types of issues locally. In this particular case, the best solution is to <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/cache-using-fetch/\">cache using <code>fetch</code> itself</a>.</p><p>Additionally, because the Workers runtime uses a very recent version of V8, it supports some JavaScript features that aren’t available in all versions of Node.js. This meant a few features implemented in Workers, like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findLast\"><code>Array#findLast</code></a>, weren’t always available in Miniflare 2.</p><p>With the Workers runtime <a href=\"/workerd-open-source-workers-runtime/\">now open-sourced</a>, Miniflare 3 can leverage the same implementations that are deployed on Cloudflare’s network, giving bug-for-bug compatibility and practically eliminating behavior mismatches. ?</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6VB6hw88YFoVMQWokJ0eIr/dda37612c76ed09051c4e997cf789c70/image4-26.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1544\" height=\"784\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Miniflare 3’s new simplified architecture using worked</p><p>This radically simplifies our implementation too. We were able to remove <b>over 50,000</b> lines of code from Miniflare 2. Of course, we still kept all the Miniflare special-sauce that makes development fun like live reload and detailed logging. ?</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/pull/392\"><img src=\"/content/images/2022/11/image5-15.png\"></a>\n<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"local-development-with-real-data\">Local development with real data</h3>\n            <a href=\"#local-development-with-real-data\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>We know that many developers choose to test their Workers remotely on the Cloudflare network as it gives them the ability to test against real data.
