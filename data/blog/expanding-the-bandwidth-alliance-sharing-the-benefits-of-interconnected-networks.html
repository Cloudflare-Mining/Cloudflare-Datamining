	<p>At Cloudflare, our mission is to help build a better Internet. That means making the Internet faster, smarter, safer, but also more cost efficient with the help of our partners. We are always on the lookout for ways to help save customers money. With that goal we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance">announced the Bandwidth Alliance with our founding partners</a> during our Birthday week.</p>
	<p>The key concept of the Bandwidth Alliance is to help reduce and in many cases waive data transfer charges, sometimes known as "bandwidth” or “egress” charges, for our mutual customers. We achieve this in partnership with the founding partners through strongly interconnected networks over peered connections. These connections typically occur within the same facility with no middleman. So, neither Cloudflare nor the cloud provider bears incremental costs. Further, we will also use our smart routing system (read details in this <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/smart-routing-for-bandwidth-alliance">technical blog post</a>) to ensure that all our customers’ traffic on participating cloud providers, once their systems are set up, qualify for this offer.</p>

	<p>The Bandwidth Alliance is providing this benefit to all Cloudflare customers at no additional cost. Our partners provide an a wide variety of choices of cloud services and products.</p>
	<p>We are working with our founding partners to make it even easier to use our services jointly. We are helping an initial set of customers use cloud storage with their Cloudflare service and zero data transfer fees. These customers were looking for a best of breed solution with specific storage and delivery needs. Please read <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance-partners-exciting-choices">this technical architecture post</a> by Kirk Schwenkler describing the considerations in enabling such a solution.</p>
	<p>This is a starting point and we expect to be developing many reference architectures with our partners to allow our customers to have a truly best of breed option without any concerns on transfer fees.</p>
	<p>Here is what the joining members say:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>“Open, affordable and free internet is what we strive for and what we give to our clients. Everyone and every company should have access to it. We are thrilled that the values shared by the Bandwidth Alliance can also be our values.”</p>
