	<p>CloudFlare is going to be at <a href="http://www.hostingcon.com/" target="_blank">HostingCon 2012</a> in Boston from Sunday, July 15th to Wednesday, July 18th. We are excited to see our current partners and meet potential new partners at the show! Our team is looking forward to an extremely busy conference and we have several fun events planned, including complimentary limousine service between Boston Logan International Airport and the Boston Sheraton Hotel, a daily CloudFlare hosted breakfast, an exhibit booth and of course, attending all of the parties.</p>
	<p>If you are already one of our certified hosting provider partners, be sure to stop by and introduce yourself. We will have CloudFlare t-shirts and some mystery goodies to celebrate the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cacheing-the-uncacheable-cloudflares-railgun-73454">launch of Railgun</a>.
