		"html": "<p>Today, we&#39;re excited to collaborate with Anthropic, Asana, Atlassian, Block, Intercom, Linear, PayPal, Sentry, Stripe, and Webflow to bring a whole new set of remote MCP servers, all built on Cloudflare, to enable <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\"><u>Claude</u></a> users to manage projects, generate invoices, query databases, and even deploy full stack applications — without ever leaving the chat interface. </p><p>Since <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol\"><u>Anthropic’s introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP</u></a>) in November, there’s been more and more excitement about it, and it seems like a new MCP server is being released nearly every day. And for good reason!  MCP has been the missing piece to make AI agents a reality, and helped define how AI agents interact with tools to take actions and get additional context.</p><p>But to date, end-users have had to install MCP servers on their local machine to use them. Today, with <a href=\"http://anthropic.com/news/integrations\"><u>Anthropic’s announcement</u></a> of Integrations, you can access an MCP server the same way you would a website: type a URL and go.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5FLvAIrlxVcKPZNRG5Qhwj/f252d4de66f45e1f06bb94d76e1bf4c1/BLOG-2811_2.png\" alt=\"BLOG-2811 2\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1860\" height=\"1999\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>At Cloudflare, we’ve been focused on<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/remote-model-context-protocol-servers-mcp/\"><u> building out the tooling</u></a> that simplifies the development of remote MCP servers, so that our customers’ engineering teams can focus their time on building out the MCP tools for their application, rather than managing the complexities of the protocol. And if you’re wondering just how easy is it to deploy a remote MCP server on Cloudflare, we’re happy to tell you that it only takes one click to get an MCP server — pre-built with support for the latest MCP standards — deployed. </p><p>But you don’t have to take our word for it, see it for yourself! Industry leaders are taking advantage of the ease of use to deliver new AI-powered experiences to their users by building their MCP servers on Cloudflare and now, you can do the same — just click “Deploy to Cloudflare” to get started. </p><a href=\"https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/tree/main/demos/remote-mcp-authless\"><img src=\"https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button\" alt=\"Deploy to Cloudflare\"/></a><p><code></code></p><p>Keep reading to learn more about the new capabilities that these companies are unlocking for their users and how they were able to deliver them. Or, see it in action by joining us for <a href=\"https://demo-day.mcp.cloudflare.com/\"><u>Demo Day</u></a> on May 1 (today) at 10:00 AM PST. </p><p>We’re also making <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/thirteen-new-mcp-servers-from-cloudflare\"><u>Cloudflare&#39;s remote MCP servers</u></a> available to customers today and sharing what we learned from building them out. </p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"mcp-powering-the-next-generation-of-applications\">MCP: Powering the next generation of applications</h2>\n            <a href=\"#mcp-powering-the-next-generation-of-applications\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>It wasn’t always the expectation that every service, whether a store, real estate agent, or service would have a website. But as more people gained access to an Internet connection, that quickly became the case.</p><p>We’re in the midst of a similar transition now to every web user having access to AI tools, turning to them for many tasks. If you’re a developer, it’s likely the case that the first place you turn when you go to write code now is to a tool like Claude. It seems reasonable then, that if Claude helped you write the code, it would also help you deploy it.</p><p>Or if you’re not a developer, if Claude helped you come up with a recipe, that it would also help you order the required groceries. </p><p>With remote MCP, all of these scenarios are now possible. And just like the first businesses built on the web had a first mover advantage, the first businesses to be built in an MCP-forward way are likely to reap the benefits. </p><p>The faster a user can experience the value of your product, the more likely they will be to succeed, upgrade, and continue to use your product. By connecting services to agents through MCP, users can simply ask for what they need and the agent will handle the rest, getting them to that “aha” moment faster. </p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"making-your-service-ai-first-with-mcp\">Making your service AI-first with MCP</h2>\n            <a href=\"#making-your-service-ai-first-with-mcp\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Businesses that adopt MCP will quickly see the impact: </p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"lower-the-barrier-to-entry\">Lower the barrier to entry</h3>\n            <a href=\"#lower-the-barrier-to-entry\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Not every user has the time to learn your dashboard or read through documentation to understand your product.

MCP integrates this crucial Sentry context directly into the developer workflow, empowering teams to consistently build and deploy reliable applications.” — David Cramer, CPO and Co-Founder, Sentry</i></p><p>Learn more about Sentry’s MCP server <a href=\"https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/\"><u>here</u></a>. </p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"block\">Block </h3>\n            <a href=\"#block\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Square&#39;s <a href=\"https://developer.squareup.com/us/en\"><u>APIs</u></a> are a comprehensive set of tools that help sellers take payments, create and track orders, manage inventory, organize customers, and more.

MCP is not just a different surface over our APIs, instead we’re thinking of it in terms of the actions it supports: publish a website, create a CMS collection, update content, and more. MCP lets us expose those actions in a way that’s discoverable, secure, and deeply contextual. It opens the door to new workflows where AI and humans can work side-by-side, without needing to cobble together solutions or handle low-level API details. Cloudflare supports this aim by offering the reliability, performance, and developer tooling we need to build modern web infrastructure. Their support for remote MCP servers is mature and well-integrated, and their approach to authentication and durability aligns with how we think about the scale and security of these offerings.” — Utkarsh Sengar, VP of Engineering, Webflow</i></p><p>Learn more about Webflow’s MCP server <a href=\"https://mcp.webflow.com\"><u>here</u></a>. </p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"start-building-today\">Start building today </h2>\n            <a href=\"#start-building-today\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>If you’re looking to build a remote MCP server for your service, get started with our documentation, watch the tutorial below, or use the button below to get a starter remote MCP server deployed to production.
