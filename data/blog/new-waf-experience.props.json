Cloudflare not only proxies enterprise applications, but also millions of personal blogs, community sites, and small businesses stores. The diversity of use cases are covered by various products we offer; however, these products are currently scattered and that makes visibility of active protection rules unclear. This pushes us to reflect on how we can best support our customers in getting the most value out of WAF by providing a clearer offering that meets expectations.</p><p>A few months ago, we reached out to our customers to answer a simple question: what do you consider to be part of WAF? We employed a range of user research methods including card sorting, tree testing, design evaluation, and surveys to help with this. The results of this research illustrated how our customers think about WAF, what it means to them, and how it supports their use cases. This inspired the product team to expand scope and contemplate what (Web Application) Security means, beyond merely the WAF.</p><p>Based on what hundreds of customers told us, our user research and product design teams collaborated with product management to rethink the security experience. We examined our assumptions and assessed the effectiveness of design concepts to create a structure (or information architecture) that reflected our customers’ mental models.</p><p>This new structure consolidates firewall rules, managed rules, and rate limiting rules to become a part of WAF. The new WAF strives to be the one-stop shop for web application security as it pertains to differentiating malicious from clean traffic.</p><p>As of today, you will see the following changes to our navigation:</p><ol><li><p><b>Firewall</b> is being renamed to <b>Security.</b></p></li><li><p>Under <b>Security,</b> you will now find <b>WAF.</b></p></li><li><p>Firewall rules, managed rules, and rate limiting rules will now appear under <b>WAF</b>.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>From now on, when we refer to <b>WAF,</b> we will be referring to above three features.</p></blockquote><p>Further, some important updates are coming for these features. Advanced rate limiting rules will be launched as part of <a href=\"/welcome-security-week-2022/\">Security Week</a>, and every customer will also get a free set of managed rules to <a href=\"/waf-for-everyone\">protect all traffic from high profile vulnerabilities</a>. And finally, in the next few months, firewall rules will move to the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/\">Ruleset Engine</a>, adding more powerful capabilities thanks to the new Ruleset API.
