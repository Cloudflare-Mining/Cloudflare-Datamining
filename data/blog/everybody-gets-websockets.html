	<p>Two summers ago, with a seemed-big-at-the-time network of 28 datacenters, not long after introducing <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/listo-medellin-colombia-cloudflares-28th-data-center/">Medellin</a>, CloudFlare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-now-supports-websockets/">introduced</a> support for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/website-optimization/web-sockets/" target="_blank">WebSockets</a>, initially for our Enterprise customers.</p>

	<p>Today, with our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-map" target="_blank">network</a> nearing 80 global locations, we're pleased to announce support for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/websockets/" target="_blank">WebSockets</a> for all our customers, including Enterprise, Business, Pro, and Free, with resources allocated by plan level.</p>
	<h3 id="whatarewebsockets">What are WebSockets?</h3>
	<p>If you don't want to read <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455" target="_blank">RFC 6455</a>, then this short paragraph from our previous blog post explains:</p>
	<p><em>The WebSocket protocol is a distinct TCP-based protocol, however, it’s initiated by an HTTP request which is then "upgraded" to create a persistent connection between the browser and the server. A WebSocket connection is bidirectional: the server can send data to the browser without the browser having to explicitly ask for it. This makes things like multiplayer games, chat, and other services that require real-time exchange of information possible over a standard web protocol</em></p>
	<p>There's a lot more technical history in <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-now-supports-websockets/">that post</a> covering how we modified NGINX to support a huge number of connections through port reuse. But the bottom line is that WebSockets are a vital technology for web sites that need to get real-time updates for features like social feeds, multimedia chat, collaborative editing, multi-player gaming, stock updates, and more.</p>
	<h3 id="performancelatency">Performance &amp; Latency</h3>
	<p>Because the WebSocket protocol creates a single connection and doesn’t require HTTP requests, WebSockets can provide anywhere from 500:1 to a 1000:1 reduction in unnecessary HTTP header traffic, compared to HTTP polling solutions.</p>
	<p>The server no longer needs to wait for a request to come back before it sends new data; it can simply push the data to the client the moment it has new information. Tests have shown a 3:1 reduction in latency compared to other polling solutions.</p>

	<h3 id="moderninternetformorepeople">Modern Internet, for More People</h3>
	<p>Last week, we expanded our deep support for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/http2" target="_blank">HTTP/2</a> to include <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-support-for-http-2-server-push-2/">Server Push</a>. HTTP/2 was finalized as a spec in 2015, so almost a newborn child as technologies go. (We're excited to help HTTP/2 grow up fast.)</p>
	<p>By comparison, WebSockets is already a toddler, as RFC 6455 was finalized in 2011.</p>
	<p>But, perhaps because of complexity or expense, WebSockets hasn't seen as wide adoption as we'd expect. CloudFlare is removing those obstacles, and frankly we're curious to see what happens.</p>
	<p>We are building a better Internet, and while that may sound like a platitude... making modern tech easy to use matters. We're eager to see what our customers do to play, grow, and thrive with another tool available.</p>
