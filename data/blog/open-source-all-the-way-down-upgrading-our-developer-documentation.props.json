We are constantly iterating, testing, analyzing, and refining content. Inspired by agile practices, treating developer content like an open source product means we approach our documentation the same way an open source software project is created and maintained.  Open source documentation empowers the developer community because it allows anyone, anywhere, to contribute content. By making both the content and the framework of the documentation site publicly accessible, we provide developers with the opportunity to not only improve the material itself but also understand and engage with the processes that govern how the documentation is built, approved, and maintained. This transparency fosters collaboration, learning, and innovation, enabling developers to contribute their expertise and learn from others in a shared, open environment. We also provide feedback to other open source products and plugins, giving back to the same community that supports us.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"building-the-best-open-source-documentation-experience\">Building the best open source documentation experience</h2>\n      <a href=\"#building-the-best-open-source-documentation-experience\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Great documentation empowers users to be successful with a new product as quickly as possible, showing them how to use the product and describing its benefits. Relevant, timely, and accurate content can save frustration, time, and money. Open source documentation adds a few more benefits, including building inclusive and supportive communities that help reduce the learning curve. We love being open source!</p><p>While the Cloudflare content team has scaled to deliver documentation alongside product launches, the open source documentation site itself was not scaling well. <a href=\"http://developers.cloudflare.com\"><u>developers.cloudflare.com</u></a> had outgrown the workflow for contributors, plus we were missing out on all the neat stuff created by developers in the community.</p><p>Just like a software product evaluation, we reviewed our business needs. We asked ourselves if remaining open source was appropriate? Were there other tools we wanted to use? What benefits did we want to see in a year or in five years? Our biggest limitations in addition to the contributor workflow challenges seemed to be around scalability and high maintenance costs for user experience improvements. </p><p>After compiling our wishlist of new features to implement, we reaffirmed our commitment to open source. We valued the benefit of open source in both the content and the underlying framework of our documentation site. This commitment goes beyond technical considerations, because it&#39;s a fundamental aspect of our relationship with our community and our philosophy of transparency and collaboration. While the choice of an open source framework to build the site on might not be visible to many visitors, we recognized its significance for our community of developers and contributors. Our decision-making process was heavily influenced by two primary factors: first, whether the update would enhance the collaborative ecosystem, and second, how it would improve the overall documentation experience. This focus reflects that our open source principles, applied to both content and infrastructure, are essential for fostering innovation, ensuring quality through peer review, and building a more engaged and empowered user community.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"cloudflare-developer-documentation-a-collaborative-open-source-approach\">Cloudflare developer documentation: A collaborative open source approach</h2>\n      <a href=\"#cloudflare-developer-documentation-a-collaborative-open-source-approach\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare’s developer documentation is <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/\"><u>open source on GitHub</u></a>, with content supporting all of Cloudflare’s products.

This time around, the migration was nearly twice as large, with 8,060 files changed. Our planning and migration took six weeks in total:</p><ul><li><p>10 days: Evaluate platforms, vendors, and features </p></li><li><p>14 days: Migrate the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/components/\"><u>components</u></a> required by the documentation site</p></li><li><p>5 days: Staging and user acceptance testing (UAT) </p></li><li><p>8 hours: Code freeze and <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/pull/16096\"><u>migrate to Astro/Starlight</u></a></p></li></ul><p>The migration resulted in removing a net -19,624 lines of code from our maintenance burden.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3r9Hj2NwU40GPLTw5TbGYG/d292b405c097ebd577173f5d61c17d03/BLOG-2600_3.png\" alt=\"GitHub image of migrated PR\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"276\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>While the number of files had grown substantially since our last major migration, our strategy was very similar to the 2021 migration.

Including our <a href=\"https://community.cloudflare.com/t/2025-mvp-nominations/705496\"><u>Cloudflare Community MVPs</u></a> as part of the planning and review period proved incredibly helpful. They provided great guidance and feedback as we planned for the migration. We only needed one day of code freeze, and there were no rollbacks or major incidents. Visitors to the site never experienced downtime, and overall the migration was a major success.</p><p>During testing, we ran into several use cases that warranted using <a href=\"https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/container-reference/\"><u>experimental Astro APIs</u></a>. These APIs were always well documented, thanks to fantastic open source content from the Astro community. We were able to implement them quickly without impacting our release timeline.</p><p>We also ran into <a href=\"https://github.com/withastro/starlight/issues/2215\"><u>an edge case</u></a> with build time performance due to the number of pages on our site (4000+). The Astro team was quick to triage the problem and begin investigation for a <a href=\"https://github.com/withastro/starlight/pull/2252\"><u>permanent fix</u></a>. Their fast, helpful fixes made us truly grateful for the support from the Astro Discord server. A big thank you to the Astro/Starlight community!</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"contribute-to-developers-cloudflare-com\">Contribute to developers.cloudflare.com!</h2>\n      <a href=\"#contribute-to-developers-cloudflare-com\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Migrating <a href=\"http://developers.cloudflare.com\"><u>developers.cloudflare.com</u></a> to Astro/Starlight is just one example of the ways we prioritize world-class documentation and user experiences at Cloudflare.
