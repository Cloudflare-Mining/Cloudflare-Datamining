One way Cloudflare is helping our customers earn their users’ trust is through industry standard security compliance certifications and regulations.</p><p>Security compliance certifications are reports created by independent, third-party auditors that validate  and document a company’s commitment to security. These external auditors will conduct a rigorous review of a company’s technical environment and evaluate whether there are thorough controls - or safeguards - in place to protect the security, confidentiality, and availability of information stored and processed in the environment. SOC 2 was established by the American Institute of CPAs and is important to many of our U.S. companies, as it is a standardized set of requirements a company must meet in order to comply. Additionally, PCI and ISO 27001 are international standards. Cloudflare cares about achieving certifications because our adherence to these standards creates confidence to customers across the globe that we are committed to security. So, the Security team has been hard at work obtaining these meaningful compliance certifications.</p><p>Since the beginning of this year, we have been renewing our PCI DSS certification in February, achieving SOC 2 Type 1 compliance in March, obtaining our ISO 27001 certification in April, and today we are proud to announce we are SOC 2 Type 2 compliant!</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"our-soc-2-journey\">Our SOC 2 Journey</h3>\n      <a href=\"#our-soc-2-journey\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>SOC 2 is a compliance certification that focuses on internal controls of an organization related to five trust services criteria. These criteria are: Security, Confidentiality, Availability, Processing Integrity, and Privacy. Each criterion presents a set of control standards that are established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and are to be used to implement controls on the information systems of a company.</p><p>Cloudflare’s Security team made the decision to evaluate our companies’ controls around three of the five criteria. We determined to pursue our SOC 2 compliance by evaluating our controls around Security, Confidentiality, and Availability across our entire organization. We first worked across the company to design and implement strong controls that meet the requirements set forth by the AICPA. This took effort and collaboration between teams in Engineering, IT, Legal, and HR to create strong controls that also make sense to our environment. Our external auditors then performed an audit of Cloudflare’s controls, and determined our security controls were suitably designed as of January 31, 2019.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><img src=\"http://staging.blog.mrk.cfdata.org/content/images/2019/06/21972-312_SOC_NonCPA.jpg\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\"><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Three months after obtaining SOC 2 Type 1 compliance, the next step for Cloudflare was to demonstrate the controls we designed were actually operating effectively. Our SOC 2 Type 2 audit tested the operating effectiveness of Cloudflare’s security controls over this three-month period. Cloudflare’s SOC 2 Type 2 report can be available upon request and describes the design of Cloudflare’s internal control framework around security, confidentiality and availability and the products and services in-scope for our certification.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"what-else\">What else?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#what-else\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"soc-3\">SOC 3</h4>\n      <a href=\"#soc-3\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In addition to SOC 2 Type 2, Cloudflare also obtained our SOC 3 report from our independent external auditors.
