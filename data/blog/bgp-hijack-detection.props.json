In other words, the original BGP protocol does not provide any authentication or ownership safeguards; any route can be originated and announced by any random network, independent of its rights to announce that route.</p><p>To address this problem, operators and researchers have proposed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure\">Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)</a> to store and validate prefix-to-origin mapping information. With RPKI, operators can prove the ownership of their network resources and create ROAs, short for Route Origin Authorisations, cryptographically signed objects that define which Autonomous System (AS) is authorized to originate a specific prefix.</p><p>Cloudflare <a href=\"/rpki/\">committed to support RPKI</a> since the early days of the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6480\">RFC</a>. With RPKI, IP prefix owners can store and share the ownership information securely, and other operators can validate BGP announcements by checking the prefix origin to the information stored on RPKI. Any hijacking attempt to announce an IP prefix with an incorrect origin AS will result in invalid validation results, and such invalid BGP messages will be discarded. This validation process is referred to as route origin validation (ROV).</p><p>In order to further advocate for RPKI deployment and filtering of RPKI invalid announcements, Cloudflare has been providing a RPKI test service, <a href=\"https://isbgpsafeyet.com/\">Is BGP Safe Yet?</a>, allowing users to test whether their ISP filters RPKI invalid announcements. We also provide rich information with regard to the RPKI status of individual prefixes and ASes at <a href=\"https://rpki.cloudflare.com/\">https://rpki.cloudflare.com/</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4MNPvwC6PpJCPQCIQhC8sl/82309707277d649b0b810ed6e3028947/image8-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"918\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><b>However</b>, the effectiveness of RPKI on preventing BGP origin hijacks depends on two factors:</p><ol><li><p>The ratio of prefix owners register their prefixes on RPKI;</p></li><li><p>The ratio of networks performing route origin validation.</p></li></ol><p>Unfortunately, neither ratio is at a satisfactory level yet. As of today, July 27, 2023, only about 45% of the IP prefixes routable on the Internet are covered by some ROA on RPKI. The remaining prefixes are highly vulnerable to BGP origin hijacks. Even for the 45% prefix that are covered by some ROA, origin hijack attempts can still affect them due to the low ratio of networks that perform route origin validation (ROV). Based on our <a href=\"/rpki-updates-data/\">recent study,</a> only 6.5% of the Internet users are protected by ROV from BGP origin hijacks.</p><p>Despite the benefits of RPKI and RPKI ROAs, their effectiveness in preventing BGP origin hijacks is limited by the slow adoption and deployment of these technologies. Until we achieve a high rate of RPKI ROA registration and RPKI invalid filtering, BGP origin hijacks will continue to pose a significant threat to the daily operations of the Internet and the security of everyone connected to it. Therefore, it’s also essential to prioritize developing and deploying BGP monitoring and detection tools to enhance the security and stability of the Internet&#39;s routing infrastructure.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"design-of-cloudflares-bgp-hijack-detection-system\">Design of Cloudflare’s BGP hijack detection system</h2>\n      <a href=\"#design-of-cloudflares-bgp-hijack-detection-system\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Our system comprises multiple data sources and three distinct modules that work together to detect and analyze potential BGP hijack events: prefix origin change detection, hijack detection and the storage and notification module.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/67bYKbfT4zBONmISARpcta/8790aaad3f3db54ba012bd751dd393c9/image6-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1340\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The Prefix Origin Change Detection module provides the data, the Hijack Detection module analyzes the data, and the Alerts Storage and Delivery module stores and provides access to the results.

Fortunately, there&#39;s this thing called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie\">prefix trie</a> in computer science that you can use to store and look up string-indexed data structures, which is ideal for our use case. We ended up developing a fast Rust-based custom IP prefix trie that we use to hold the relevant information such as the origin ASN and the AS path for each IP prefix and allows information to be updated based on BGP announcements and withdrawals.</p><p>The example figure below shows an example of the AS path information for prefix <code>192.0.2.0/24</code> stored on a prefix trie.

Fortunately, there are several types of data sources that can collectively provide a relatively good idea of whether a BGP announcement is legitimate or not. These data sources can be categorized into two types: inter-AS relationships and prefix-origin binding.</p><p>The inter-AS relationship datasets include AS2org and AS2rel datasets from <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/\">CAIDA/UCSD</a>, AS2rel datasets from <a href=\"https://bgpkit.com/\">BGPKIT</a>, AS organization datasets from <a href=\"https://www.peeringdb.com/\">PeeringDB</a>, and <a href=\"/route-leak-detection-with-cloudflare-radar/#route-leak-detection\">per-prefix AS relationship data</a> built at Cloudflare. These datasets provide information about the relationship between autonomous systems, such as whether they are upstream or downstream from one another, or if the origins of any change signal belong to the same organization.</p><p>Prefix-to-origin binding datasets include live RPKI validated ROA payload (VRP) from the <a href=\"https://rpki.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare RPKI portal</a>, daily Internet Routing Registry (IRR) dumps curated and cleaned up by <a href=\"https://www.manrs.org/\">MANRS</a>, and prefix and AS <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogon_filtering\">bogon</a> lists (private and reserved addresses defined by <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918\">RFC 1918</a>, <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5735\">RFC 5735</a>, and <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6598\">RFC 6598</a>). These datasets provide information about the ownership of prefixes and the ASes that are authorized to originate them.</p><p>By combining all these data sources, it is possible to collect information about each BGP announcement and answer questions programmatically. For this, we have a scoring function that takes all the evidence gathered for a specific BGP event as the input and runs that data through a sequence of checks. Each condition returns a neutral, positive, or negative weight that keeps adding to the final score. The higher the score, the more likely it is that the event is a hijack attempt.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates this sequence of checks:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4y6YiYezGew65wYeNFPOqs/f2883b0c385966acbc991be815bb4a1c/image1-12.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1410\" height=\"1682\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As you can see, for each event, several checks are involved that help calculate the final score: RPKI, Internet Routing Registry (IRR), bogon prefixes and ASNs lists, AS relationships, and AS path.</p><p>Our guiding principles are: if the newly announced origins are RPKI or IRR invalid, it’s more likely that it’s a hijack, but if the old origins are also invalid, then it’s less likely. We discard events about private and reserved ASes and prefixes. If the new and old origins have a direct business relationship, then it’s less likely that it’s a hijack. If the new AS path indicates that the traffic still goes through the old origin, then it’s probably not a hijack.</p><p>Signals that are deemed legitimate are discarded, while signals with a high enough confidence score are flagged as potential hijacks and sent downstream for further analysis.</p><p>It&#39;s important to reiterate that the decision is not binary but a score. There will be situations where we find false negatives or false positives. The advantage of this framework is that we can easily monitor the results, learn from additional datasets and conduct the occasional manual inspection, which allows us to adjust the weights, add new conditions and continue improving the score precision over time.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"aggregating-bgp-hijack-events\">Aggregating BGP hijack events</h4>\n      <a href=\"#aggregating-bgp-hijack-events\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Our BGP hijack detection system provides fast response time and requires minimal resources by operating on a per-message basis.</p><p>However, when a hijack is happening, the number of hijack signals can be overwhelming for operators to manage.

For example, Radar will soon get a dedicated routing section to provide digestible BGP information for given networks or regions, such as distinct routable prefixes, RPKI valid/invalid/unknown routes, distribution of IPv4/IPv6 prefixes, etc. Our goal is to provide the best data and tools for routing security to the community, so that we can build a better and more secure Internet together.</p><p>Visit <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> for additional insights around (Internet disruptions, routing issues, Internet traffic trends, attacks, Internet quality, etc.).
