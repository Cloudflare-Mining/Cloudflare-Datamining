	<p>While content inspection policies can be created, they cannot be applied to HTTPS traffic since content payloads are encrypted. This is a problem for organizations as it is common for sensitive data to live within an encrypted payload and bypass IT content inspection policies. <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage?dateRange=52w">99.7% of all requests</a> use HTTPS today and the usage has been seeing a steady increase.</p>
	<p>To address this visibility gap, organizations can decrypt packets using HTTPS inspection. With Cloudflare Gateway, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-https-inspection">SSL/TLS decryption</a> can be performed to inspect HTTPS traffic for security risks. When TLS decryption is enabled, Gateway will decrypt all traffic sent over HTTPS, apply your HTTP policies, and then re-encrypt the request with a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates">user-side certificate</a>. Jamf is able to seamlessly enable this process on managed devices.</p>

	<p>With the corporate network and employees being boundless, it is harder than ever to keep data secure. Sensitive data such as customer credit card information, social security numbers, API tokens, or confidential Microsoft Office documents are easily shared beyond your network boundary, intentionally or otherwise. This is made worse as attackers are increasingly tricking well-intentioned employees to inadvertently share sensitive data with hackers. Such data leaks are not uncommon and usually result in costly reputational and compliance damages.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/dlp">Cloudflare’s Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</a> allows for policies to be built in with ease to keep highly sensitive data secure. Cloudflare also provides <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/predefined-profiles">predefined profiles</a> for detecting financial information such as credit card numbers and national identifiers such as social security numbers or tax file numbers in addition to credentials and secrets such as GCP keys, AWS keys, Azure API keys, and SSH keys.

	<p>Firewalls, VPNs, network access controls help protect against attacks directed at internal networks. However, many attackers focus on exploiting web browsers due to their ubiquity and frequent use. Remote Browser Isolation aims to reduce an organization’s risk exposure by allowing access to any destination on the Internet, but protecting endpoints by using an isolated cloud environment to load content.</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

		<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/52x068hd2EHPTZAh4kBYxQ/7ff1cd21e341301e375076939c57f200/image4-3.png" alt="" class="kg-image" width="1999" height="1180" loading="lazy">

	<p>This works by actually loading web pages – and all of their potentially dangerous scripts and code – in a headless Chromium browser in Cloudflare’s global network. The visual and interactive elements that are loaded remotely are sent back to the user’s device via “draw” commands, essentially rendering visual objects in the browser as the user would expect. If a known or zero-day exploit is loaded, the user’s device is completely protected.</p>
	<p>Another benefit of Remote Browser Isolation is granular, browser-specific Data Loss Prevention controls. This includes restricting download, upload, copy-paste, keyboard input, and printing functions on all or specific websites.</p>

	<p>Companies often rely on platforms like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 for business collaboration and productivity, while individuals use these services for their personal use.</p>
	<p>Allowing users to access these cloud services with both business and personal credentials from the same corporate endpoint poses a significant risk for unauthorized data access and loss. Imagine a scenario where an employee can log in into the corporate account of a SaaS application, download sensitive files, and then login into their personal account on the same company device to upload the stolen files to their personal SaaS application account.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare's Gateway HTTP policies provide <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/http-policies/tenant-control/#tenant-control">SaaS Tenancy Control</a> to ensure that users can only log in to admin-defined SaaS provider tenants with their enterprise credentials, effectively blocking login ability to personal accounts or other business tenants within the defined SaaS provider.</p>
	<p>Jamf's Access Policies serve as the initial assessment, determining if the users are authorized for the targeted cloud application and if they are requesting access from a company-sanctioned device.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare's Gateway HTTP policy then processes the requests forwarded from Jamf to define the domains that are permitted to log in to that SaaS provider.</p>
	<p><b>Steps to implement SaaS Tenancy Control:</b></p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<p><a href="https://learn.jamf.com/bundle/jamf-security-documentation/page/Configuring_Access_Policy.html">Configure one or more Access policies</a> that define the SaaS providers for which you would like to enable tenant controls. Use the below pre-defined SaaS app access policy templates for the respective SaaS provider:</p>

			<p>To ensure these policies are enforced on any network, enable “Restrict access when Jamf Trust is disabled” under the Security tab of the policy to prevent bypassing of these tenancy controls.</p>
