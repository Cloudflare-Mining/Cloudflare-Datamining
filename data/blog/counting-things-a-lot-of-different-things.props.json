This article is a look at how we implemented a rate limiter able to run quickly and accurately at the edge of the network which is able to cope with the colossal volume of traffic we see at Cloudflare.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"lets-just-do-this-locally\">Let’s just do this locally!</h3>\n            <a href=\"#lets-just-do-this-locally\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As the Cloudflare edge servers are running NGINX, let’s first see how the stock <a href=\"https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html\">rate limiting</a> module works:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">http {\n    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=ratelimitzone:10m rate=15r/m;\n    ...\n    server {\n        ...\n        location /api/expensive_endpoint {\n            limit_req zone=ratelimitzone;\n        }\n    }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>This module works great: it is reasonably simple to use (but requires a config reload for each change), and very efficient. The only problem is that if the incoming requests are spread across a large number of servers, this doesn’t work any more. The obvious alternative is to use some kind of centralized data store. Thanks to NGINX’s Lua scripting module, that we already use extensively, we could easily implement similar logic using any kind of central data backend.</p><p>But then another problem arises: how to make this fast and efficient?</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"all-roads-lead-to-rome-not-with-anycast\">All roads lead to Rome?

All the traffic going to our edge servers is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast\">anycast</a> traffic.

Unfortunately each new TCP connection might hit a different server inside that PoP. But we can still narrow down our problem: we can actually create an isolated counting system inside each PoP. This mostly solves the latency problem and greatly improves the availability as well.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"storing-counters\">Storing counters</h3>\n            <a href=\"#storing-counters\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>At Cloudflare, each server in our edge network is as independent as possible to make their administration simple.

A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing\">consistent hashing</a> algorithm ensures that when the cluster is resized, only a few number of keys are hashed differently.</p><p>In our architecture, each server hosts a shard of the database.

What we call the <i>sampling period</i> in the next paragraph is the reference unit of time for the counter (1 second for a 10 req/sec rule, 1 minute for a 600 req/min rule, ...).</p><p>The most naive implementation is to simply increment a counter that we reset at the start of each sampling period. This works but is not terribly accurate as the counter will be arbitrarily reset at regular intervals, allowing regular traffic spikes to go through the rate limiter. This can be a problem for resource intensive endpoints.</p><p>Another solution is to store the timestamp of every request and count how many were received during the last sampling period. This is more accurate, but has huge processing and memory requirements as checking the state of the counter require reading and processing a lot of data, especially if you want to rate limit over long period of time (for instance 5,000 req per hour).</p><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket\">leaky bucket</a> algorithm allows a great level of accuracy while being nicer on resources (this is what the stock NGINX module is using). Conceptually, it works by incrementing a counter when each request comes in. That same counter is also decremented over time based on the allowed rate of requests until it reaches zero. The capacity of the bucket is what you are ready to accept as “burst” traffic (important given that legitimate traffic is not always perfectly regular). If the bucket is full despite its decay, further requests are mitigated.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/nur2wjEAyjE0S6VYblkr3/080ad1cbb09aa1bf6a294ffb4955e9e0/leakybucket.svg.png\" alt=\"Leaky bucket algorithm schema\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1288\" height=\"691\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>However, in our case, this approach has two drawbacks:</p><ul><li><p>It has two parameters (average rate and burst) that are not always easy to tune properly</p></li><li><p>We were constrained to use the memcached protocol and this algorithm requires multiple distinct operations that we cannot do atomically<a href=\"#fn3\">[3]</a></p></li></ul><p>So the situation was that the only operations available were <code>GET</code>, <code>SET</code> and <code>INCR</code> (atomic increment).</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"sliding-windows-to-the-rescue\">Sliding windows to the rescue</h3>\n            <a href=\"#sliding-windows-to-the-rescue\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2gvU2RabELQEWsauNMm8cu/ac296e8bf4e122f18935500ef0bd1c2e/14247536929_1a6315311d_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"640\" height=\"431\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC BY-SA 2.0</a> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/halfrain/14247536929/\">image</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/halfrain/\">halfrain</a></p><p>The naive fixed window algorithm is actually not that bad: we just have to solve the problem of completely resetting the counter for each sampling period. But actually, can’t we just use the information from the previous counter in order to extrapolate an accurate approximation of the request rate?</p><p>Let’s say I set a limit of 50 requests per minute on an API endpoint. The counter can be thought of like this:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4SfLGYqNjjjxfJo0C9rU4H/e000ba22680e27910c8963a7111a97c8/sliding.svg.png\" alt=\"Sliding window example\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1063\" height=\"453\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In this situation, I did 18 requests during the current minute, which started 15 seconds ago, and 42 requests during the entire previous minute. Based on this information, the rate approximation is calculated like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">rate = 42 * ((60-15)/60) + 18\n     = 42 * 0.75 + 18\n     = 49.5 requests</pre></code>\n            <p>One more request during the next second and the rate limiter will start being very angry!</p><p>This algorithm assumes a constant rate of requests during the previous sampling period (which can be any time span), this is why the result is only an approximation of the actual rate. This algorithm can be improved, but in practice it proved to be good enough:</p><ul><li><p>It smoothes the traffic spike issue that the fixed window method has</p></li><li><p>It very easy to understand and configure: no average vs. burst traffic, longer sampling periods can be used to achieve the same effect</p></li><li><p>It is still very accurate, as an analysis on 400 million requests from 270,000 distinct sources shown:</p><ul><li><p>0.003% of requests have been wrongly allowed or rate limited</p></li><li><p>An average difference of 6% between real rate and the approximate rate</p></li><li><p>3 sources have been allowed despite generating traffic slightly above the threshold (false negatives), the actual rate was less than 15% above the threshold rate</p></li><li><p>None of the mitigated sources was below the threshold (false positives)</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Moreover, it offers interesting properties in our case:</p><ul><li><p>Tiny memory usage: only two numbers per counter</p></li><li><p>Incrementing a counter can be done by sending a single <code>INCR</code> command</p></li><li><p>Calculating the rate is reasonably easy: one GET command<a href=\"#fn4\">[4]</a> and some very simple, fast math</p></li></ul><p>So here we are: we can finally implement a good counting system using only a few memcache primitives and without much contention. Still we were not happy with that: it requires a memcached query to get the rate. At Cloudflare we’ve seen a few of the largest L7 attacks ever. We knew that large scale attacks would have crushed the memcached cluster like this. More importantly, such operations would slow down legitimate requests a little, even under normal conditions. This is not acceptable.</p><p>This is why the increment jobs are run asynchronously without slowing down the requests. If the request rate is above the threshold, another piece of data is stored asking all servers in the PoP to start applying the mitigation for that client.
