Over the <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/mena-internet-shutdowns-during-exams/\">last several years</a>, Sudan has also implemented Internet shutdowns during secondary school exams in an effort to limit cheating or leaking of exam questions. (We covered the 2021 round of shutdowns in a <a href=\"/sudans-exam-related-internet-shutdowns/\">blog post</a>.)</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/accessnow/status/1535268473625972743\">schedule</a> published by digital rights organization AccessNow, this year’s Secondary Certificate Exams will be taking place in Sudan daily between June 11–22, except June 17. As of this writing, near-complete shutdowns have been observed on June 11, 12, and 13 between 0530-0830 UTC (0730-1030 local time), as seen in the graph below. The timing of these shutdowns aligns with a communication <a href=\"https://sudantelegraph.com/news/sudan-announcement-of-cutting-off-the-internet-in-conjunction-with-the-high-school-exams-sessions/\">reportedly</a> sent to subscribers of telecommunications services in the country, which stated <i>“In implementation of the decision of the Attorney General, the Internet service will be suspended during the Sudanese certificate exam sessions from 8 in the morning until 11 in the morning.”</i></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4BvGTxPOVFT3C0eqzoQyDz/d985b9376aaacd0e91321b51898b2529/image10-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>It is interesting to note that the shutdown, while nationwide, does not appear to be complete.

These shutdowns <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/mena-internet-shutdowns-during-exams/\">reportedly</a> cost businesses across the country an estimated 500 million Algerian Dinars (approximately $3.4 million USD) for every hour the Internet was unavailable. In 2021, there were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alisibai/status/1407017281922682901\">two Internet shutdowns each day</a> that exams took place—the first between 0700–1100 UTC (0800–1200 local time), and the second between 1330–1600 UTC (1430–1700 local time).</p><p>This year, <a href=\"https://www.aps.dz/en/algeria/43911-belabed-kicks-off-baccalaureate-examination-from-adrar\">more than 700,000 students</a> will sit for the baccalaureate exams between June 12-16.</p><p>Perhaps recognizing the economic damage caused by these Internet shutdowns, this year the Algerian Minister of National Education <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheAlgiersPost/status/1535917324485656576\">announced</a> that there would be no Internet shutdowns on exam days.</p><p>Thus far, it appears that this has been the case. However, it appears that the Algerian government has shifted to a content blocking-based approach, instead of a wide-scale Internet shutdown. The Cloudflare Radar graph below shows two nominal drops in country-level traffic during the two times on June 13 that the exams took place—0730–1000 UTC (0830–1100 local time) and 1330–1600 UTC (1430–1700 local time), similar to last year’s timing.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/52oT6U76Ut7T7MfamhK42A/ed6f70a9bff38799d441330e07e9b60a/image7.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The disruptions are also visible in traffic graphs for several major Algerian network providers, as shown below.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2m7snum430H4LfAmrnJGw0/2c667d2b40bc214660b0520a9eac0e91/image4-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3YDfrbnnikmxFQPqBkv9xd/6a7ea4531f07ee9b1e88a9888655bfbe/image6-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6JlAuFSUFljhGi3nZwTCts/c8b6cf9b819e0b170b03ac3d59ab7cfc/image8-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Analysis of additional Cloudflare data further supports the hypothesis that Algeria is blocking access to specific websites and applications, rather than shutting down the Internet completely.</p><p>As described in a <a href=\"/last-mile-insights/\">previous blog post</a>, Network Error Logging (NEL) is a browser-based reporting system that allows users’ browsers to report connection failures to an endpoint specified by the webpage that failed to load.
