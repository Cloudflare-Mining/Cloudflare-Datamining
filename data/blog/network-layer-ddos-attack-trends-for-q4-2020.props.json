One is the volume of traffic it delivers, or its ‘bit rate’ (measured in gigabits-per-second). Another is the number of packets it delivers, or its ‘packet rate’ (measured in packets-per-second). Attacks with high bit rates attempt to saturate last-mile network links of the target, and attacks with high packet rates attempt to overwhelm routers or other in-line hardware <a href=\"/network-layer-ddos-attack-trends-for-q3-2020/#blog-1-ddos\">devices</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2RcquZz3afZORkFCgX36I9/a88c1203f6ef1febdbd32b813c174b82/image8-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1567\" height=\"793\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In Q4, as in previous quarters, the majority of attacks were quite small —  under 1 Gbps and 1M pps, specifically. This trend is not surprising, since most attacks are launched by amateur attackers using tools that are easy to use and cost a few dollars at most. Small attacks may also serve as a smokescreen to distract security teams from other kinds of cyberattacks, or to test a network’s existing defense mechanisms.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1E4MxtMUrD6jJyaE3fRs4r/292e5113b67c5aa523853af314307cc3/image16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1567\" height=\"792\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>However, the overall popularity of small attacks didn’t tell the whole story in Q4. Attacks over 500Mbps and 50K pps constituted a larger percentage of total attacks than they did in previous quarters. In fact, the number of attacks over 100 Gbps increased by 10x from Q3, and those over 10M pps increased by 3.6x.</p><p>One unique large attack Cloudflare observed was an ACK flood DoS attack that was automatically detected and mitigated by Cloudflare’s systems. What was unique about this attack was not the max packet rate, but the attack method that appears to have been borrowed from the world of acoustics.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/35buUEe8hOv4zBOQOA9iP8/5707197c5eeb59b31485f69baf0d0f2a/image18.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1568\" height=\"792\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As can be seen in the graph above, the attack’s packet rate followed a wave-shaped pattern for over 19 hours. It seems as though the attacker was inspired by an acoustics concept called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28acoustics%29\">beat</a>. For this reason, we codenamed this attack “Beat”. In acoustics, a beat is a term that is used to describe an interference of two different wave frequencies. You can read more about the Beat attack in our blog post: <a href=\"/beat-an-acoustics-inspired-ddos-attack/\">Beat - An Acoustics Inspired DDoS Attack</a></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4PEt7dDxV5LREn7Q6iIdth/eae37ba35274b2a5f7cac79c2a6dc9d3/image14.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1568\" height=\"796\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Whether packet intensive or bit intensive, the increase in large DDoS attacks is a disturbing trend. It indicates that attackers are getting more brazen, and are using tools that allow them to launch larger attacks. What’s worse, often larger attacks have implications to not just target the network, but also intermediary service providers that serve the target network downstream.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5wdXb2mmtdoiXsN7xcyPDM/b71256231eac1a31492c7dc0e009ad74/image10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1568\" height=\"794\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"attack-duration\">Attack Duration</h2>\n            <a href=\"#attack-duration\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>73% of attacks in Q4 ‘20 lasted for under an hour.

This gives us more accuracy in our endeavor to pinpoint geographic locations that are observing more threats than others. We’re able to achieve geographical accuracy in our report because we have data centers in over 200 cities, in more than 100 countries around the world.</p><p>Looking at Q4 metrics, we observed interesting insights — our data centers in Mauritius, Romania, and Brunei recorded the highest percentages of attack traffic relative to non-attack traffic. Specifically, between 4.4% and 4.9% of all traffic in those countries came from DDoS attacks. Another way of saying this is that almost 5 out of every 100 bytes was part of attack traffic.

</div>\n          <p>In <a href=\"/network-layer-ddos-attack-trends-for-q3-2020/\">our previous quarterly DDoS report</a>, we noted a rise in extortion and ransom-based DDoS (RDDoS) attacks around the world. In a RDDoS attack, a malicious party threatens a person or organization with a cyberattack that could knock their networks, websites, or applications offline for a period of time, unless the person or organization pays a ransom. You can read more about RDDoS attacks <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ransom-ddos-attack/\">here</a>.</p><p>In Q4 ‘20, this disturbing trend continued. Organizations large and small came to Cloudflare asking for help in keeping their network infrastructure online while they figured out how to respond to ransom notes. <a href=\"/ransom-ddos-attacks-target-a-fortune-global-500-company/\">Read this story</a> of what a Fortune Global 500 company did when they received a ransom note, and about their recommendations for organizations.</p><p>Cloudflare continues to closely monitor this trend. If you receive a threat:</p><ol><li><p><b>Do not panic — we recommend you to not pay the ransom</b>: Paying the ransom only encourages bad actors and finances illegal activities — and there’s no guarantee attackers won’t attack your network anyway.</p></li><li><p><b>Notify local law enforcement</b>: They will also likely request a copy of the ransom letter that you received.</p></li><li><p><b>Contact Cloudflare</b>: We can help ensure your website and network infrastructure are safeguarded from these ransom attacks.</p></li></ol>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"cloudflare-ddos-protection\">Cloudflare DDoS Protection</h2>\n            <a href=\"#cloudflare-ddos-protection\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare provides comprehensive L3-L7 DDoS protection. In 2017, we pioneered the elimination of the industry standard surge pricing for DDoS attacks, providing customers with unmetered and unlimited DDoS protection. Since then, we’ve onboarded thousands of customers of all sizes — including <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/wikimedia-foundation\">Wikimedia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/panasonic\">Panasonic</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/discord\">Discord</a> — that use Cloudflare to  protect and accelerate their Internet properties. Why do they choose Cloudflare? Three main reasons:</p><p><b>1. No scrubs</b>Cloudflare doesn&#39;t operate scrubbing centers as we believe that <a href=\"/no-scrubs-architecture-unmetered-mitigation/\">the scrubbing center model is a flawed approach to DDoS protection</a>. Scrubbing centers cause delays and cost too much to build and run. What’s more, DDoS attacks are asymmetric — attackers have more available bandwidth than a single scrubbing center will ever be able to handle.</p><p>Cloudflare’s network is architected so that every machine in every data center performs DDoS mitigation. Doing this at the edge is the only way to mitigate at scale without impacting performance. Our Anycast-based architecture makes our capacity equivalent to our DDoS scrubbing capacity, the largest in the market at 51 Tbps. This means Cloudflare detects and mitigates DDoS attacks close to the source of attack. Better yet, Cloudflare’s global threat intelligence acts like an immune system for the Internet — employing our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-machine-learning/\">machine learning models</a> to learn from and mitigate attacks against any customer to protect them all.</p><p><b>2. It’s about time</b>Most organizations are in some stage of their journey from on-prem to the cloud. The threat landscape, functional requirements, and scale of business applications are evolving faster than ever before, and the volume and sophistication of network attacks are already straining the defensive capabilities of even the most advanced enterprises. One concern many enterprises have when adopting the cloud is added latency for applications. Most cloud-based DDoS protection services rely on specialized data centers aka “scrubbing centers&#39;&#39; for DDoS mitigation. Backhauling traffic to those data centers can add significant latency depending on its location relative to the destination server.</p><p>This problem compounds when an organization uses different providers for different networking functions. When traffic must hop from provider to provider, latency can be measured in hundreds of milliseconds.</p><p>Cloudflare’s <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/network\">distributed geographical presence</a> ensures that attacks are globally detected and mitigated in under 3 seconds on average — making it one of the fastest in the industry.</p><p><b>3. It’s not just about DDoS</b>DDoS attacks constitute just one facet of the many cyber threats organizations are facing today. As businesses shift to a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust</a> approach, network and security buyers will face larger threats related to network access, and a continued surge in the frequency and sophistication of bot-related attacks.</p><p>A key design tenet while building products at Cloudflare is integration. <a href=\"/introducing-cloudflare-one/\">Cloudflare One</a> is a solution that uses a Zero Trust security model to provide companies a better way to protect devices, data, and applications — and is deeply integrated with our existing platform of security and DDoS solutions.</p><p>To learn more about Cloudflare’s DDoS solution <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/\">contact us</a> or <a href=\"https://dash.cloudflare.com/\">get started</a> today by signing up on our dashboard.</p>",
