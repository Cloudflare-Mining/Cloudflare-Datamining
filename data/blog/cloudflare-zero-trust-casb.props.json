We deployed applications in a data center and made them available to this network. Users inside the San Francisco office connected to a secure Wi-Fi network that placed them on the network.</p><p>For everyone else, we punched a hole in that private network and employees pretended they were in the office by using Virtual Private Network (VPN) clients on their device. We had created a castle-and-moat by attempting to extend the walls of the San Francisco office to the rest of the world.</p><p>Our Security team hated this. Once authenticated to the VPN client, a user could generally connect to any destination on our private network - the network trusted them by default. We lacked segmentation over who could reach what resource. Just as terrifying, we had almost no visibility into what was happening inside the network.</p><p>One option would have been to build out a traditional <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-network-segmentation/\">segmented network</a> with internal firewalls and a configuration nightmare keeping VPN appliances, firewalls and servers synchronized. We knew that there was a better, more flexible, more modern way.</p><p>We <a href=\"/cloudflare-access-now-teams-of-any-size-can-turn-off-their-vpn/\">built the first product</a> in Cloudflare One, Cloudflare Access, to solve these problems. Cloudflare Access uses our global network to check every request or connection for identity, group membership, device posture, multifactor method and more to determine if it should be allowed. Organizations can build rules that are <a href=\"/cloudflare-access-for-saas/\">specific to applications</a> or <a href=\"/zero-trust-private-networking-rules/\">IP addresses on a private network</a> that runs on Cloudflare. Cloudflare Access also logs every request and connection, providing high-visibility with low-effort.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/r9LBX7Ixxq9AHT57SGg2t/a39e0621b2e958df0a8b6ddaea545b94/image2-9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1192\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This migration <a href=\"/dogfooding-from-home/\">changed our security model at Cloudflare</a>.

Cloudflare’s network accelerates requests and packets, connecting users to the tools they need even faster.</p><p>Cloudflare Access let us and thousands of other teams deprecate the legacy VPN security model, but the rest of the Internet posed a different kind of challenge—how do we keep our users, and their devices and data, safe from attack?</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"next-protect-your-team-from-the-rest-of-the-internet\">Next, protect your team from the rest of the Internet</h2>\n            <a href=\"#next-protect-your-team-from-the-rest-of-the-internet\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>The public Internet allows just about anyone to connect either as a user or a host. That openness is both powerful and terrifying. When employees on corporate devices need to use the rest of the Internet, they run a risk of encountering phishing websites, malware hosts, and other attempts to steal data and compromise businesses.</p><p>Historically, organizations relied on a similar castle-and-moat approach. They backhauled user traffic to any destination on the Internet through a centralized data center. Inside that data center, IT departments installed and monitored physical appliances to provide security like network firewalls, proxies, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/\">secure web gateways</a>.</p><p>This model worked fine when employees only needed to connect to the public Internet occasionally. Most work was performed on the desktop in front of the user. When companies began moving to SaaS applications hosted by other teams, and employees spent the majority of their day on the Internet, this security framework fell apart.</p><p>User experience suffered when all traffic had to first reach a distant security appliance. IT and Security teams had to maintain and patch appliances while struggling to scale up or down. The cost of backhauling traffic over <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mpls/\">MPLS links</a> erased the financial savings gained by migrating to SaaS applications on the Internet.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/CFqGU69JXbDdLi9l0k1Rl/2ad1a59e9edcb518f957281275122d22/image1-10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1152\" height=\"742\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/\">Cloudflare Gateway</a> turns Cloudflare’s network in the other direction to protect users as they connect out to the rest of the Internet. Instead of backhauling traffic to a centralized location, users connect to a nearby Cloudflare data center where we apply one or more layers of security filtering and logging before accelerating their traffic to its final destination.</p><p>Customers can choose how they want to start this journey. Cloudflare operates the world’s fastest DNS resolver, on top of which <a href=\"/helping-keep-governments-safe-and-secure/\">we’ve built DNS filtering</a> powered by the intelligence we collect from handling so much of the Internet every day. Other customers decide to begin by ripping out their network firewall appliances and moving that functionality into Cloudflare’s network by connecting roaming users or entire offices and data centers to Cloudflare.</p><p>As threats become more advanced, Cloudflare’s Secure Web Gateway inspects HTTPS traffic for malware hiding in file downloads or the accidental loss of data to unapproved SaaS services. Cloudflare’s <a href=\"/phishing-protection-browser/\">Browser Isolation service adds another layer</a> of threat protection by running the browser in our network instead of on the user device. With Cloudflare Gateway and Browser Isolation, security teams also can apply granular data loss control to traffic as it flows through our network—from stopping file uploads to blocking copy-and-paste in the web page itself.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"now-control-the-data-and-configurations-in-your-saas-applications\">Now, control the data and configurations in your SaaS applications</h2>\n            <a href=\"#now-control-the-data-and-configurations-in-your-saas-applications\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>At this point in a Zero Trust journey, your team can control how users access critical resources and how you keep those users and their data safe from external attack. Both of these require control of the network—inspecting traffic as it leaves devices in your organization or as it arrives in your infrastructure. That leaves one piece missing. As more of your data lives in SaaS applications outside your control, how do you maintain a consistent level of filtering, logging, and auditing?</p><p>The Cloudflare Zero Trust platform released many features in the last year to help customers solve this problem and the broader range of “CASB” challenges. First, we built a feature that allows your team to <a href=\"/cloudflare-access-for-saas/\">force logins to your SaaS applications</a> through Cloudflare’s Secure Web Gateway where you can control rules and visibility. Next, we used the data from the Secure Web Gateway to provide your team with a <a href=\"/introducing-shadow-it-discovery/\">comprehensive Shadow IT report</a> to discover what applications your team is using and what they should be using.</p><p>Customers use the Shadow IT report in particular to begin building <a href=\"/gateway-app-policies/\">rules to block access to unapproved SaaS applications</a>, or to block actions like file uploads to specific unapproved SaaS applications, but the collaboration available in these tools becomes a risk to your organization.</p><p>It’s easy to be a single-click away from a data breach. We could share a document with the public Internet instead of our team. We could leave an S3 bucket unprotected. We could invite the wrong users to a private GitHub repository or install a malicious plugin to our email system. The data-at-rest in these SaaS applications is vulnerable to new types of attacks.</p><p>Some of these applications have tried to solve this problem in their own space, but the rapid adoption of SaaS applications and the struggle to configure each separately led to thousands of wasted hours in security teams. The Vectrix founders talked with teams who had to dedicate full-time employees just to manually configure and check permission settings and logs. So they built a better answer.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7cmmwOLBF0qHh7LI45LWyU/f0fab3c537668ca0f98046f0d5d4b2ac/image3-13.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Vectrix scans the SaaS applications that your team uses to detect anomalies in configuration, permissions, and sharing.

Customers can begin to flag risks in their organization in a matter of minutes without the need for a complex deployment.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"1-1-3-in-terms-of-value-for-our-customers-when-used-with-our-existing-zero-trust-products\">1+1=3 in terms of value for our customers when used with our existing Zero Trust products</h3>\n            <a href=\"#1-1-3-in-terms-of-value-for-our-customers-when-used-with-our-existing-zero-trust-products\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The Vectrix product will not be inserted as a point solution add-on.

If you are interested, please <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/lp/casb-beta/\">sign up here</a>. Don’t let the beta delay the start of your own journey with these products—we’ll be inviting users off of the waitlist based on when they first started deploying Cloudflare’s Zero Trust products.</p>",
