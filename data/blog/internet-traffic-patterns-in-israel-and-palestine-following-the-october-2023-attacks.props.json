Israel <a href=\"https://apnews.com/live/israel-hamas-war-live-updates#0000018b-0f83-d2a1-a1df-8fcb0a320000\">officially declared</a> that it is at war the next day. Cloudflare&#39;s data shows that Internet traffic was impacted in different ways, both in Israel and Palestine, with two networks (autonomous systems) in the Gaza Strip going offline a few hours after the attacks. Subsequently, on October 9, two additional networks also experienced outages. We also saw an uptick in cyberattacks targeting Israel, including a 1.26 billion HTTP requests DDoS attack, and Palestine.</p><p>Starting with general Internet traffic trends, there was a clear increase in Internet traffic right after the attacks <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/sirens-warn-of-rockets-launched-towards-israel-from-gaza-news-reports\">reportedly began</a> (03:30 UTC, 06:30 local time). Traffic spiked at around 03:35 UTC (06:35 local time) in both Israel (~170% growth compared with the previous week) and Palestine (100% growth).</p><p>That growth is consistent with other situations, where we’ve seen surges in Internet traffic when countrywide events occur and people are going online to check for news, updates, and more information on what is happening, with social media and messaging also playing a role. However, in Palestine, that traffic growth was followed by a clear drop in traffic around 08:00 UTC (11:00 local time).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6CFb3dO4clVjHYCo7Buqg1/cd100ccad8f596b1152cde752a9f6add/1b.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6APUBBhS6Vfng2M0O86bh0/fe88ae590da7089d77ba1e8ef8b86e23/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The Palestine uptick in traffic after the Hamas attacks started is more visible when only looking at HTTP requests.

The Gaza Governorate was impacted, with traffic dropping on October 7, 2023, after 09:15 UTC. On October 9, at 18:00 UTC, traffic was 46% lower than in the previous week.
