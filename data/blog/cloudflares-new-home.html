	<p>Cloudflare opened its first office today in downtown Palo Alto, CA. Our<br>
		team has grown from 3 people to five and we are excited to have Matthieu<br>
		and Ian onboard. Matthieu and Ian are engineers that will help make<br>
		Cloudflare awesome for its users.</p>
	<p>Our new office space is really cool. It has a startup feel with an open<br>
		area where we all work, break-out rooms when we need to work in smaller<br>
		groups and a perfect place to hang our sign outside. And, as an added<br>
		bonus, we have a patio that gets lots of sunshine during the day. The<br>
		next purchase: A BBQ!</p>
