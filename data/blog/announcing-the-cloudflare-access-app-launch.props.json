When you protect an application with Access, users never have to connect to a private network and never have to deal with a clunky VPN client. Instead, they reach on-premise apps as if they were SaaS tools. Behind the scenes, Access evaluates and logs every request to those apps for identity, giving administrators more visibility and security than a traditional VPN.</p><p>Administrators need about an hour to deploy Access. End user logins take about 20 ms, and that response time is consistent globally. Unlike VPN appliances, Access runs in every data center in Cloudflare’s network in <a href=\"/cloudflare-expanded-to-200-cities-in-2019/\">200 cities</a> around the world. When Access works well, it should be easy for administrators and invisible to the end user.</p><p>However, users still need to locate the applications behind Access, and for internally managed applications, traditional dashboards require constant upkeep. As organizations grow, that roster of links keeps expanding. Department leads and IT administrators can create and publish manual lists, but those become a chore to maintain. Teams need to publish custom versions for contractors or partners that only make certain tools visible.</p><p>Starting today, teams can use Cloudflare Access to solve that challenge. We’re excited to announce the first feature in Access built specifically for end users: the Access App Launch portal.</p><p>The Access App Launch is a dashboard for all the applications protected by Access. Once enabled, end users can login and connect to every app behind Access with a single click.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-does-it-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>When administrators secure an application with Access, any request to the hostname of that application stops at Cloudflare’s network first. Once there, Cloudflare Access checks the request against the list of users who have permission to reach the application.</p><p>To check identity, Access relies on the identity provider that the team already uses. Access integrates with providers like OneLogin, Okta, AzureAD, G Suite and others to determine who a user is. If the user has not logged in yet, Access will prompt them to do so at the identity provider configured.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7yNiimYXl24VVzkJCVTJRc/ac405b8050df3eb754b3fb73098f320f/access-solution-diagram_3x-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"860\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When the user logs in, they are redirected through a subdomain unique to each Access account. Access assigns that subdomain based on a hostname already active in the account. For example, an account with the hostname “widgetcorp.tech” will be assigned “widgetcorp.cloudflareaccess.com”.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1dofxJ68JdSDrFj4o7VBwg/928a8605a2c3153fb5bf32ad6c539bd9/app-launch-1.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2080\" height=\"1512\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The Access App Launch uses the unique subdomain assigned to each Access account. Now, when users visit that URL directly, Cloudflare Access checks their identity and displays only the applications that the user has permission to reach.

Since they are already authenticated, they do not need to login again.</p><p>In the background, the Access App Launch decodes and validates the token stored in the cookie on the account’s subdomain.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-is-it-configured\">How is it configured?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-is-it-configured\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Access App Launch can be configured in the Cloudflare dashboard in three steps.
