	<p>Cloudflare operates in more than 250 cities in over 100 countries, where we interconnect with over 10,000 network providers in order to provide a broad range of services to millions of customers. The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions. In many cases, these disruptions can be attributed to a physical event, while in other cases, they are due to an intentional government-directed shutdown. In this post, we review selected Internet disruptions observed by Cloudflare during the first quarter of 2022, supported by traffic graphs from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Radar</a> and other internal Cloudflare tools, and grouped by associated cause.</p>

	<p>Internet outages caused by “earth movers” are more frequently caused by errant <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/fiber-seeking-backhoe.html">backhoes</a>. However, two Internet disruptions in the first quarter were caused by more significant earth movement — a volcanic eruption and an earthquake.</p>
	<p>The first impacted connectivity on the island nation of <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/to">Tonga</a>, when the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption damaged <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/tonga-cable">the submarine cable connecting Tonga to Fiji</a>, resulting in a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-is-back-in-tonga-after-38-days-of-outage">38 day Internet outage</a>. After the January 14 eruption, only minimal Internet traffic (via satellite services) was seen from Tonga. On February 22, Digicel <a href="https://www.digicelgroup.com/to/en/news/2022/Feb/22nd/data-services-fully-restored.html">announced</a> that the main island was back online after initial submarine cable repairs were completed – the immediate return of traffic is clearly visible in the figure below. However, it was estimated that repairs to the domestic cable, connecting outlying islands, could take an additional six to nine months.</p>

	<p>The second disruption, caused by a 7.3 magnitude <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1504118499014291462">earthquake off the coast of central Japan</a> on March 16, was significantly shorter, and had a significantly smaller impact. The earthquake occurred around 1436 UTC, causing power outages that resulted in a loss of Internet connectivity in cities including Tokyo for several hours, as seen in the figure below. Almost exactly 11 years prior, a magnitude 8.9 earthquake also had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110314134526/http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/03/japan-quake.shtml">nominal impact</a> on Internet connectivity in Japan, that time apparently due to damage to subsea cable systems.</p>

	<p>Internet resilience is, of course, heavily dependent on the resilience of the underlying physical infrastructure, including data centers, terrestrial fiber, and submarine cables. Damage to this infrastructure often disrupts Internet connectivity.</p>
	<p>Early in the morning of January 5, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/gm">the Gambia</a> was <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-gambia-without-internet">completely isolated from the global Internet</a>. As evident in the figure below, the incident lasted over eight hours, between 0117 and 0945 UTC. According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Gamtel/status/1478670244067651587">press release</a> from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/25250?date_filter=last_7_days">GAMTEL</a>, after the failure of the primary link (damage to the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/africa-coast-to-europe-ace">ACE</a> submarine cable), traffic was routed onto two backup links through Senegal. However, these backup links also failed because they converged in a location that was ultimately identified as a single point of failure.</p>

	<p>In addition to the physical infrastructure, reliable electrical power is also critical for resilient Internet connectivity. At a provider level, loss of power can take key data centers and routers offline, impacting connectivity for customers and other connected networks. Consumer power outages can take home/business routers and connected devices offline, forcing users onto mobile connectivity, assuming that is/remains available.</p>

	<p>As discussed above, the underlying technical or physical causes of Internet disruptions are often easily identified, frequently thanks to social media or other communications from the impacted network providers. However, sometimes disruptions are observed that are correlated with a real-world (often political) event with no specified technical or physical cause, while other times disruptions are observed but are both uncorrelated and unattributed.</p>
	<p>In Kazakhstan, an Internet disruption began on January 5 <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-shut-down-in-kazakhstan-amid-unrest">amid mass protests against sudden increases in energy prices</a>. Starting around 1030 UTC, traffic from Kazakhstan dropped to near zero. The figure below shows that traffic returned to a regular diurnal pattern on January 11, but several apparent restorations of connectivity are also visible during the six-day disruption. These brief periods of connectivity appeared to align with televised speeches or announcements from the Zazakh president.</p>

	<p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has now been going on for over a month. In some cases, Internet connectivity has been collateral damage from the kinetic military action, while in other cases, targeted attacks on network providers and power outages have disrupted connectivity. Technicians from Ukrainian service providers have been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2022/03/22/while-russians-bombs-fall-around-them-ukraines-engineers-battle-to-keep-the-internet-running">risking their lives to keep the country online</a>, and have been largely successful – Cloudflare Radar traffic data for <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ua">Ukraine</a> shows that as of the end of March, peak traffic levels are at 85-90% of pre-invasion peaks. An <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-traffic-patterns-in-ukraine-since-february-21-2022">earlier blog post</a> provides additional details about Internet traffic patterns observed in Ukraine during the first week after the conflict began.</p>
	<p>Below we highlight just a few significant disruptions observed on major Ukrainian network providers in March.</p>
	<p>Two brief outages were observed at <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/6849">Ukrtelecom</a> during the second week of March, shown in the figure below. The first, on March 8, lasted for just over two hours, while the second one, on March 10, lasted for approximately 40 minutes. No root cause has been reported for these disruptions.</p>

	<p>Later in the month, on March 28, Ukrtelecom experienced a <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1508460545170681862">~15 hour outage</a>, lasting from 0800 UTC to approximately 0100 on March 29, as seen in the figure below. A <a href="https://twitter.com/dsszzi/status/1508528209075257347">Twitter thread from the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine</a> explained that the outage was caused by “a powerful cyberattack” against Ukrtelecom’s infrastructure, and that “<i>In order to preserve its network infrastructure and to continue providing services to Ukraine’s Armed Forces and other military formations as well as to the customers, Ukrtelecom has temporarily limited providing its services to the majority of private users and business-clients.</i>” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ukrtelecom_russiaukraineconflict-staywithukraine-ftth-activity-6914925170142978048-SPCU">A LinkedIn post from Ukrtelecom</a> also highlights the non-stop work that the company has been doing to re-establish telecommunications services in impacted regions across the country.</p>

	<p>Despite occasional connectivity disruptions, the Internet remains remarkably resilient. This resiliency is increasingly critical as the Internet finds its way into more and more areas of everyday life around the world. In addition to providing a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/about-overview">suite of solutions</a> that support that resiliency, we use the data exhaust from these solutions to monitor Internet reliability, availability, security, and performance.</p>
