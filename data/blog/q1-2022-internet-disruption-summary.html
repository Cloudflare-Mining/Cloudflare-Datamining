	<p>Cloudflare operates in more than 250 cities in over 100 countries, where we interconnect with over 10,000 network providers in order to provide a broad range of services to millions of customers. The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions. In many cases, these disruptions can be attributed to a physical event, while in other cases, they are due to an intentional government-directed shutdown. In this post, we review selected Internet disruptions observed by Cloudflare during the first quarter of 2022, supported by traffic graphs from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Radar</a> and other internal Cloudflare tools, and grouped by associated cause.</p>
	<h3>Plate tectonics</h3>
	<p>Internet outages caused by “earth movers” are more frequently caused by errant <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/fiber-seeking-backhoe.html">backhoes</a>. However, two Internet disruptions in the first quarter were caused by more significant earth movement — a volcanic eruption and an earthquake.</p>
	<p>The first impacted connectivity on the island nation of <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/to">Tonga</a>, when the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption damaged <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/tonga-cable">the submarine cable connecting Tonga to Fiji</a>, resulting in a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-is-back-in-tonga-after-38-days-of-outage">38 day Internet outage</a>. After the January 14 eruption, only minimal Internet traffic (via satellite services) was seen from Tonga. On February 22, Digicel <a href="https://www.digicelgroup.com/to/en/news/2022/Feb/22nd/data-services-fully-restored.html">announced</a> that the main island was back online after initial submarine cable repairs were completed – the immediate return of traffic is clearly visible in the figure below. However, it was estimated that repairs to the domestic cable, connecting outlying islands, could take an additional six to nine months.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>The second disruption, caused by a 7.3 magnitude <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1504118499014291462">earthquake off the coast of central Japan</a> on March 16, was significantly shorter, and had a significantly smaller impact. The earthquake occurred around 1436 UTC, causing power outages that resulted in a loss of Internet connectivity in cities including Tokyo for several hours, as seen in the figure below. Almost exactly 11 years prior, a magnitude 8.9 earthquake also had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110314134526/http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/03/japan-quake.shtml">nominal impact</a> on Internet connectivity in Japan, that time apparently due to damage to subsea cable systems.</p>

	<h3>Infrastructure damage</h3>
	<p>Internet resilience is, of course, heavily dependent on the resilience of the underlying physical infrastructure, including data centers, terrestrial fiber, and submarine cables. Damage to this infrastructure often disrupts Internet connectivity.</p>
	<p>Early in the morning of January 5, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/gm">the Gambia</a> was <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-gambia-without-internet">completely isolated from the global Internet</a>. As evident in the figure below, the incident lasted over eight hours, between 0117 and 0945 UTC. According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Gamtel/status/1478670244067651587">press release</a> from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/25250?date_filter=last_7_days">GAMTEL</a>, after the failure of the primary link (damage to the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/africa-coast-to-europe-ace">ACE</a> submarine cable), traffic was routed onto two backup links through Senegal. However, these backup links also failed because they converged in a location that was ultimately identified as a single point of failure.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>Around 2130 UTC on January 20, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-outage-in-yemen-amid-airstrikes">Internet traffic to Yemen</a> dropped to near zero, as shown in the figure below, after ongoing airstrikes reportedly hit a telecommunications building in Al-Hudaydah where the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/falcon">FALCON</a> undersea cable lands. The outage lasted four days, finally recovering around 2100 on January 24. The outage primarily affected <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/30873">YemenNet (Public Telecommunication Corporation)</a>, the state-owned telecommunications provider.</p>

	<p>On March 1, <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1498608898349146117">Tasmania suffered a 6.5-hour Internet outage</a> after two of the three submarine cables (<a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/basslink">Basslink</a>, <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/bass-strait-1">Bass Strait-1</a>, <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/bass-strait-2">Bass Strait-2</a>) connecting it to the Australian mainland were cut.</p>
	<p>According to a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-01/widespread-telecommunications-and-internet-outage-in-tasmania/100871822">published report</a>, one of the cuts was on the Victorian (mainland) end, and the other on the Tasmanian side, with both cuts caused by “third parties”. &nbsp;A significant reduction in traffic between 0130 - 0800 UTC is visible in the figure below.</p>

	<p>Although initially believed to be the result of a <a href="https://twitter.com/vesinfiltro/status/1507058201296089092">power outage</a> (<a href="https://internetdisruption.report/tag/venezuela">all too common in Venezuela</a>), a <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1507078068992679944">March 24 Internet disruption</a> in the country was ultimately due to a <a href="https://twitter.com/salaprensaCantv/status/1507000854301216773">fiber cut</a>. Internet traffic to <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/8048">CANTV</a> customers in multiple Venezuelan states dropped significantly between 1140 and 1740 UTC, as seen in the figure below. In addition to this disruption, <a href="https://twitter.com/vesinfiltro">VE sin Filtro</a> reported a number of additional multi-hour, multi-state Internet disruptions in Venezuela during the first quarter.</p>

	</figure>
	<h3>Power outages</h3>
	<p>In addition to the physical infrastructure, reliable electrical power is also critical for resilient Internet connectivity. At a provider level, loss of power can take key data centers and routers offline, impacting connectivity for customers and other connected networks. Consumer power outages can take home/business routers and connected devices offline, forcing users onto mobile connectivity, assuming that is/remains available.</p>
	<p>The interconnected electrical grids of <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/kz">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/uz">Uzbekistan</a>, and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/kg">Kyrgyzstan</a> all suffered outages on January 24 after Kazakhstan's North-South power line was disconnected <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/power-blackout-hits-kazakhstan-kyrgyzstan-uzbekistan-2022-01-25">due to "emergency imbalances"</a>. These power outages caused multi-hour <a href="https://twitter.com/dbelson/status/1485965578112319501">Internet disruptions across all three countries</a> starting around 0600 UTC, as the figures below show. The impact to traffic in Kazakhstan appeared to be fairly minor, while traffic declined significantly in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan and took longer to recover.</p>

	<h3>DDoS attack</h3>
	<p>Although distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks often target web or application servers in an attempt to knock a given website or application offline, such attacks that target network infrastructure can have more widespread impact, not only restricting access to sites and applications hosted within that network, but also disrupting connectivity for users attached to the network.</p>
	<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1503470338436382726">Such a DDoS attack</a> targeted <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/8867">AS8867</a> (E-Gov - Tehila Project) in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/il">Israel</a> on March 14. The figure below shows that Internet traffic to that ASN began to decline just before 1530 UTC. A <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israeli-government-sites-crash-in-cyberattack-1.10674433">published report</a> notes that the websites of the interior, health, justice and welfare ministries, as well as that of the Prime Minister's office, were all taken offline as a result of the attack.</p>

	<h3>Unspecified technical causes</h3>
	<p>As discussed above, the underlying technical or physical causes of Internet disruptions are often easily identified, frequently thanks to social media or other communications from the impacted network providers. However, sometimes disruptions are observed that are correlated with a real-world (often political) event with no specified technical or physical cause, while other times disruptions are observed but are both uncorrelated and unattributed.</p>
	<p>In Kazakhstan, an Internet disruption began on January 5 <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-shut-down-in-kazakhstan-amid-unrest">amid mass protests against sudden increases in energy prices</a>. Starting around 1030 UTC, traffic from Kazakhstan dropped to near zero. The figure below shows that traffic returned to a regular diurnal pattern on January 11, but several apparent restorations of connectivity are also visible during the six-day disruption. These brief periods of connectivity appeared to align with televised speeches or announcements from the Zazakh president.</p>

	<h3>Russian invasion of Ukraine</h3>
	<p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has now been going on for over a month. In some cases, Internet connectivity has been collateral damage from the kinetic military action, while in other cases, targeted attacks on network providers and power outages have disrupted connectivity. Technicians from Ukrainian service providers have been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2022/03/22/while-russians-bombs-fall-around-them-ukraines-engineers-battle-to-keep-the-internet-running">risking their lives to keep the country online</a>, and have been largely successful – Cloudflare Radar traffic data for <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ua">Ukraine</a> shows that as of the end of March, peak traffic levels are at 85-90% of pre-invasion peaks. An <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-traffic-patterns-in-ukraine-since-february-21-2022">earlier blog post</a> provides additional details about Internet traffic patterns observed in Ukraine during the first week after the conflict began.</p>
	<p>Below we highlight just a few significant disruptions observed on major Ukrainian network providers in March.</p>
	<p>Two brief outages were observed at <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/6849">Ukrtelecom</a> during the second week of March, shown in the figure below. The first, on March 8, lasted for just over two hours, while the second one, on March 10, lasted for approximately 40 minutes. No root cause has been reported for these disruptions.</p>
