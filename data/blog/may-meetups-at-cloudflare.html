Go Sessions are part of a program designed by GoSF members to provide a guided pair-programming experience to increase knowledge of using Go in production. Experienced Go developers will lead coding exercises that will run you through Go compiling, dependency management, program structure, concurrency, and more. Interested in learning more?
