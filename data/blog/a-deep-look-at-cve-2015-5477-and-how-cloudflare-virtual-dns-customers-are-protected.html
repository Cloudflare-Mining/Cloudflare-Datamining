	<p>Last week ISC <a href="https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01272">published</a> a patch for a critical remotely exploitable vulnerability in the BIND9 DNS server capable of causing a crash with a single packet.</p>

	<p>The public summary tells us that a mistake in handling of queries for the TKEY type causes an assertion to fail, which in turn crashes the server. Since the assertion happens during the query parsing, there is no way to avoid it: it's the first thing that happens on receiving a packet, before any decision is made about what to do with it.</p>
	<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2930">TKEY queries</a> are used in the context of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2845">TSIG</a>, a protocol DNS servers can use to authenticate to each other. They are special in that unlike normal DNS queries they include a “meta” record (of type TKEY) in the EXTRA/ADDITIONAL section of the message.</p>

	<p>Since the exploit packet is now public, I thought we might take a dive and look at the vulnerable code. Let's start by taking a look at the output of a crashing instance:</p>

	<p>This is extremely helpful--after all this is a controlled crash caused by a failed assertion--and tells us what failed and where: <code>message.c:2352</code>. Here's the excerpt.</p>
	<pre class="language-c"><code class="language-c">// https://source.isc.org/git/bind9.git -- faa3b61 -- lib/dns/message.c

	<p>What we have here is a function "<code>dns_message_findname</code>" that searches for an RRset with the given name and type in the given message section. It employs a really common C API: to get the results the caller passes pointers that will be filled in (<code>dns_name_t **name, dns_rdataset_t **rdataset</code>).</p>

	<p>As the big comment ironically acknowledges, it's really strict when validating these pointers: if they don't point to <code>(dns_name_t *)NULL</code> the REQUIRE assertion will fail and the server will crash with no attempt at recovery. Code calling this function must take extra care to pass a pointer to a NULL <code>dns_name_t *</code>, which the function will fill in to return the found name.</p>
	<p>In not-memory safe languages is not uncommon to crash when a programmer assertion is violated, because a program might not be able to cleanup its own memory after something that is not supposed to happen happens.</p>
	<p>So we continue our investigation by climbing up the stack trace to find the illegal call. Next step is <code>dns_tkey_processquery</code>. Here is a simplified excerpt.</p>

	<p>There are two <code>dns_message_findname</code> calls here. Since we are looking for the one that passes a dirty <code>name</code> we can ignore the first one which is preceded by an explicit <code>name = NULL;</code>.</p>
	<p>The second call is more interesting. The same <code>dns_name_t *name</code> is reused without resetting it to NULL after the previous <code>dns_message_findname</code> call. This must be where the bug is.</p>

	<p>Now the question is: when would <code>dns_message_findname</code> set <code>name</code> but not return <code>ISC_R_SUCCESS</code> (so that the <i>if</i> is satisfied)? Let's have a look at the full function body now.</p>

}</code></pre>
	<p>As you can see <code>dns_message_findname</code> uses first <code>findname</code> to match the records with the target name, and then <code>dns_message_findtype</code> to match the target type. In between the two calls... <code>*name = foundname</code>! So if <code>dns_message_findname</code> can find a record with <code>name == qname</code> in <code>DNS_SECTION_ADDITIONAL</code> but then it turns out not to have type <code>dns_rdatatype_tkey</code>, <code>name</code> will be filled in and a failure returned. The second <code>dns_message_findname</code> call will trigger on the dirty <code>name</code> and... boom.</p>

	<p>This bug <a href="https://twitter.com/ISCdotORG/status/626132833849905152">was found with</a> the amazing <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl"><i>american fuzzy lop</i></a> fuzzer by <a href="https://twitter.com/@jfoote_">@jfoote_</a>. A fuzzer is an automated tool that keeps feeding automatically mutated inputs to a target program until it crashes. You can see how it eventually stumbled upon the TKEY query + non-TKEY EXTRA RR combo and found this bug.</p>
	<h3>Virtual DNS customers have always been protected</h3>
	<p>Good news! <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/virtual-dns">CloudFlare Virtual DNS</a> customers have always been protected from this attack, even if they run BIND. Our custom Go DNS server, RRDNS, parses and sanitizes all queries before forwarding them to the origin servers if needed.</p>
	<p>Since Virtual DNS does not support TSIG and TKEY (which are meant to authenticate server-to-server traffic, not recursive lookups) it has no reason to relay EXTRA section records in queries, so it doesn't! That reduces the attack surface and indeed makes it impossible to exploit this vulnerability through Virtual DNS.</p>
	<p>No special rules are in place to protect from this specific vulnerability: RRDNS always validates incoming packets, making sure they look like regular queries, and strips them down to the most simple form possible before relaying them.</p>
