At the time we had an internal debate about turning off RC4 altogether, but statistics showed that we couldn&#39;t. Although only a tiny percentage of web browsers hitting CloudFlare&#39;s network needed RC4 that&#39;s still thousands of people contacting web sites that use our service.</p><p>To understand who needs RC4 I delved into our live logging system and extracted the User-Agent and country the visitor was coming from. In total, roughly 0.000002% of requests to CloudFlare use the RC4 protocol. It&#39;s a small number, but it&#39;s significant enough we believe we need to continue to support it for our customers.</p><p>Requests to CloudFlare sites that are still using RC4 fall into four main categories: people passing through proxies, older phones (often candy bar), other (more on that below) and a bucket of miscellaneous (like software checking for updates, old email programs and ancient operating systems).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3CVcmHPD38EgvHNKtrRWK0/ef5490734ebdc9c760b18a82b7db5e89/breakdown_1_1.png\" alt=\"Breakdown\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"840\" height=\"843\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"ciphers\">Ciphers</h3>\n            <a href=\"#ciphers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Examining data for a 59 hour period last week showed that 34.4% of RC4-based requests used RC4-SHA and 63.6% used ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA.

RC4 is a very fast encryption algorithm and it can be easily implemented on a wide variety of hardware (including phones with slow processors and even on <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/cryptonutter/downloads/detail?name=rc4-avr-v1.0.7z\">8-bit systems</a> like the Arduino). After all, RC4 dates back to 1987.</p><p>The core of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4\">RC4</a> is the following algorithm:</p><p>i := 0\nj := 0\nwhile GeneratingOutput:\ni := (i + 1) mod 256\nj := (j + S[i]) mod 256\nswap values of S[i] and S[j]\nK := S[(S[i] + S[j]) mod 256]\noutput K\nendwhile</p><p>It generates a pseudo-random stream of numbers (all 8-bit numbers in the range 0 to 255) by doing simple lookups in a table, swapping of values and addition modulo 256 (which is very, very fast). The output of that algorithm is usually combined with the message to be encrypted byte-by-byte using some fast scheme like an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher\">XOR</a>.</p><p>The following short video shows the RC4 algorithm in action. It&#39;s been restricted to 32 values rather than 256 to fit it nicely on the screen but the algorithm is identical. The red stream of numbers at the bottom shows the pseudo-random stream output by the algorithm. (The code for this animation is available <a href=\"https://github.com/jgrahamc/rc4animation\">here</a>; thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntoineGrondin\">@AntoineGrondin</a> for making the animated GIF).</p><p>[</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2xH34568BEvuqrcdGbjdon/add611815b7956635af0fe13ea510d3e/rc4.gif\" alt=\"RC4 Animated\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1246\" height=\"285\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>](<a href=\"/content/images/rc4.gif\">/content/images/rc4.gif</a>)</p><p>So, RC4 is fast, but who&#39;s still using it?

The software makes a connection to its own update server using HTTPS but the available ciphers are limited and RC4 is chosen.
