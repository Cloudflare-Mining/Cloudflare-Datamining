Ideally, every new TCP connection to Cloudflare would carry at least one request that results in a successful data exchange, but that is far from the truth. In reality, we find that, globally, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/security-and-attacks/#tcp-resets-and-timeouts\"><u>approximately 20%</u></a> of new TCP connections to Cloudflare’s servers time out or are closed with a TCP “abort” message either before any request can be completed or immediately after an initial request.</p><p>This post explores those connections that, for various reasons, appear to our servers to have been halted unexpectedly before any useful data exchange occurs. Our work reveals that while connections are normally ended by clients, they can also be closed due to third-party interference. Today we’re excited to launch a new <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/security-and-attacks#tcp-resets-and-timeouts\"><u>dashboard</u></a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-get-tcp-resets-timeouts-summary\"><u>API endpoint</u></a> on Cloudflare Radar that shows a near real-time view of TCP connections to Cloudflare’s network that terminate within the first 10 ingress packets due to resets or timeouts, which we’ll refer to as <i>anomalous</i> TCP connections in this post. Analyzing this anomalous behavior provides insights into scanning, connection tampering, DoS attacks, connectivity issues, and other behaviors.</p><p>Our ability to generate and share this data via Radar follows from a global investigation into <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/connection-tampering\"><u>connection tampering</u></a>. Readers are invited to read the technical details in the peer-review <a href=\"https://research.cloudflare.com/publications/SundaraRaman2023/\"><u>study</u></a>, or see its <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RD73IgzQMFo?si=OWvNnlNNLalbhygV&t=2984\"><u>corresponding presentation</u></a>.

A TCP connection passes through several distinct stages, from connection establishment, to data transfer, to connection close.</p><p>A TCP connection is established with a 3-way handshake. The handshake begins when one party, called the client, sends a packet marked with the ‘SYN’ flag to initialize the connection process. The server responds with a “SYN+ACK” packet where the ‘ACK’ flag acknowledges the client’s initialization ‘SYN’. Additional synchronization information is included in both the initialization packet and its acknowledgement. . Finally, the client acknowledges the server’s SYN+ACK packet with a final ACK packet to complete the handshake.</p><p>The connection is then ready for data transmission. Typically, the client will set the PSH flag on the first data-containing packet to signal to the server’s TCP stack to forward the data immediately up to the application. Both parties continue to transfer data and acknowledge received data until the connection is no longer needed, at which point the connection is closed.</p><p><a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9293#section-3.6\"><u>RFC 9293</u></a> describes two ways in which a TCP connection may be closed:</p><ul><li><p>The normal and graceful TCP close sequence uses a FIN exchange. Either party can send a packet with the FIN flag set to indicate that they have no more data to transmit. Once the other party acknowledges that FIN packet, that direction of the connection is closed. When the acknowledging party is finished transmitting data, it transmits its own FIN packet to close, since each direction of the connection must be closed independently.</p></li><li><p>An abort or “reset” signal in which one party transmits RST packets, instructing the other party to immediately close and discard any connection state. Resets are generally sent when some unrecoverable error has occurred.</p></li></ul><p>The full lifetime of a connection that closes gracefully with a FIN is captured in the following sequence diagram.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/eh8fIM3Ei3Y9WapGgRuhC/995421abee0d6aeb257e2700db9759ee/1622-2.png\" alt=\"1622-2\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1060\" height=\"1064\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i><sub>A normal TCP connection starts with a 3-way handshake and ends with a FIN handshake</sub></i></p><p>Additionally, a TCP connection may be terminated by a <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/when-tcp-sockets-refuse-to-die/\"><u>timeout</u></a> which specifies the maximum duration that a connection can be active without receiving data or acknowledgements. An inactive connection, for example, can be kept open with <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/when-tcp-sockets-refuse-to-die/\"><u>keepalive</u></a> messages.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of potential reasons that we might observe resets or timeouts:</p><ul><li><p><b>Scanners: </b>Internet scanners may send a SYN packet to probe if a server responds on a given port, but otherwise fail to clean up a connection once the probe has elicited a response from the server.</p></li><li><p><b>Sudden Application Shutdowns: </b>Applications might abruptly close open connections if they are no longer required. For example, web browsers may send RSTs to terminate connections after a tab is closed, or connections can time out if devices lose power or connectivity.</p></li><li><p><b>Network Errors: </b>Unstable network conditions (e.g., a severed cable connection could result in connection timeouts)</p></li><li><p><b>Attacks: </b>A malicious client may send attack traffic that appears as anomalous connections. For instance, in a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/\"><u>SYN flood</u></a> (half-open) attack, an attacker repeatedly sends SYN packets to a target server in an attempt to overwhelm resources as it maintains these half-opened connections.</p></li><li><p><b>Tampering:</b> Firewalls or other middleboxes capable of intercepting packets between a client and server may drop packets, causing timeouts at the communicating parties. Middleboxes capable of deep packet inspection (DPI) might also leverage the fact that the TCP protocol is unauthenticated and unencrypted to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_injection\"><i><u>inject</u></i><u> packets</u></a> to disrupt the connection state. See our <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/connection-tampering\"><u>accompanying blog post</u></a> for more details on connection tampering.</p></li></ul><p>Understanding the scale and underlying reasons for anomalous connections can help us to mitigate failures and build a more robust and reliable network. We hope that sharing these insights publicly will help to improve transparency and accountability for networks worldwide.</p><h2 id=\"dataset\">How to use the dataset</h2><p>In this section, we provide guidance and examples of how to interpret the TCP resets and timeouts dataset by broadly describing three use cases: confirming previously-known behaviors, exploring new targets for followup study, and longitudinal studies to capture changes in network behavior over time.</p><p>In each example, the plot lines correspond to the stage of the connection in which the anomalous connection closed, which provides valuable clues into what might have caused the anomaly. We place each incoming connection into one of the following stages:</p><p><b>Post-SYN (mid-handshake)</b>: Connection resets or timeouts after the server received a client’s SYN packet. Our servers will have replied, but no acknowledgement ACK packet has come back from the client before the reset or timeout. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing/\"><u>Packet spoofing</u></a> is common at this connection stage, so geolocation information is especially unreliable.</p><p><b>Post-ACK (immediately post-handshake)</b>: Connection resets or timeouts after the handshake completes and the connection is established successfully. Any subsequent data, that may have been transmitted, never reached our servers.</p><p><b>Post-PSH (after first data packet)</b>: Connection resets or timeouts after the server received a packet with the PSH flag set. The PSH flag indicates that the TCP packet contains data (such as a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/#:~:text=The%20%27client%20hello%27%20message%3A\"><u>TLS Client Hello</u></a> message) that is ready to be delivered to the application.</p><p><b>Later (after multiple data packets)</b>: Connection resets within the first 10 packets from the client, but after the server has received multiple data packets.</p><p><b>None</b>: All other connections.</p><p>To keep focus on legitimate connections, the dataset is constructed after connections are processed and filtered by Cloudflare’s attack mitigation systems.  For more details on how we construct the dataset, see <a href=\"#anomalousTCP\"><u>below.</u></a></p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"start-with-a-self-evaluation\">Start with a self-evaluation</h3>\n            <a href=\"#start-with-a-self-evaluation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>To start, we encourage readers to visit the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/security-and-attacks#tcp-resets-and-timeouts\"><u>dashboard on Radar</u></a> to view the results worldwide, and for their own country and ISP.</p><p>Globally, as shown below, about 20% of new TCP connections to Cloudflare’s network are closed by a reset or timeout within the first 10 packets from the client.

With reset injection, middleboxes on the path to the destination inspect data portions of packets. When the middlebox sees a packet to a forbidden domain name, it injects forged TCP Reset (RST) packets to one or both communicating parties to cause them to abort the connection. If the middlebox did not drop the forbidden packet first, then the server will receive both the client packet that triggered the middlebox tampering – perhaps containing a TLS Client Hello message with a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/\"><u>Server Name Indication (SNI)</u></a> field – followed soon afterwards by the forged RST packet.</p><p>In the TCP resets and timeouts dataset, a connection disrupted via reset injection would typically appear as a Post-ACK, Post-PSH, or Later anomaly (but, as a reminder, not all anomalies are due to reset injection).</p><p>As an example, the reset injection technique is <a href=\"https://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA175630128&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=10727825\"><u>known</u></a> and commonly associated with the so-called Great Firewall of China (GFW).

Thus, if an ISP drops the packet containing the SNI, the server would still see the SYN and ACK packets from the client but no subsequent packets, which is consistent with a Post-ACK connection anomaly.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7KUfARxvDEogTFeh7PL4n5/68dc237c07a60e431cc2d2654cade2f7/1622-17.png\" alt=\"1622-17\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><sub><i>via </i></sub><a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/security-and-attacks/AS28403?dateStart=2024-07-28&dateEnd=2024-08-26#tcp-resets-and-timeouts\"><sub><i>Cloudflare Radar</i></sub></a></p><p>Turning to <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/pe\"><u>Peru</u></a>, another country with a similar profile in the dataset, there are even higher rates of Post-ACK and Post-PSH anomalies compared to Mexico.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1vLO0sP2Ap3206PX4Ysdim/a4f0274b4d884703ff4b4d879a667d90/1622-18.png\" alt=\"1622-18\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><sub><i>via </i></sub><a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/security-and-attacks/pe?dateStart=2024-07-28&dateEnd=2024-08-26#tcp-resets-and-timeouts\"><sub><i>Cloudflare Radar</i></sub></a></p><p>Focusing on specific ASes, we see that <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as12252\"><u>AS12252 (Claro Peru)</u></a> shows high rates of Post-ACK anomalies similar to AS28403 in Mexico.

The scale of Cloudflare’s global network presents unique challenges for data processing and analysis. We share our techniques to help readers to understand our methodology, interpret the dataset, and replicate the mechanisms in other networks or servers.</p><p>Our methodology can be summarized as follows:</p><ol><li><p>Log a sample of connections arriving at our client-facing servers. This sampling system is completely passive, meaning that it has no ability to decrypt traffic and only has access to existing packets sent over the network. </p></li><li><p>Reconstruct connections from the captured packets. A novel aspect of our design is that only one direction needs to be observed, from client to server.</p></li><li><p>Match reconstructed connections against a set of signatures for anomalous connections terminated by resets or timeouts. These signatures consist of two parts: a <i>connection stage</i>, and a set of <i>tags</i> that indicate specific behaviors derived from the literature and our own observations.</p></li></ol><p>These design choices keep encrypted packets safe and can be replicated anywhere, without needing access to the destination server.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"first-sample-connections\">First, sample connections</h2>\n            <a href=\"#first-sample-connections\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Our main goal was to design a mechanism that scales, and gives us broad visibility into all connections arriving at Cloudflare’s network. Running traffic captures on each client-facing server works, but does not scale. We would also need to know exactly where and when to look, making continuous insights hard to capture. Instead, we sample connections from all of Cloudflare’s servers and log them to a central location where we could perform offline analysis.</p><p>This is where we hit the first roadblock: existing packet logging pipelines used by Cloudflare’s analytics systems log individual packets, but a connection consists of many packets. To detect connection anomalies we needed to see all, or at least enough, packets in a given connection. Fortunately, we were able to leverage a flexible logging system built by Cloudflare’s DoS team for <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/about/how-ddos-protection-works/\"><u>analyzing packets involved in DDoS attacks</u></a> in conjunction with a carefully crafted invocation of two <a href=\"https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/iptables/iptables.8.en.html\"><code><u>iptables</u></code></a> rules to achieve our goal.</p><p>The first <code>iptables</code> rule randomly selects and marks new connections for sampling. In our case, we settled on sampling one in every 10,000 ingress TCP connections. There’s nothing magical about this number, but at Cloudflare’s scale it strikes a balance between capturing enough without straining our data processing and analytics pipelines. The <code>iptables</code> rules only apply to packets after they have passed the DDoS mitigation system. As TCP connections can be long-lived, we sample only new TCP connections. Here is the <code>iptables</code> rule for marking connections to be sampled:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">-t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --syn -m state \n--state NEW -m statistic --mode random \n--probability 0.0001 -m connlabel --label &lt;label&gt; \n--set -m comment --comment &quot;Label a sample of ingress TCP connections&quot;\n</pre></code>\n            <p></p><p>Breaking this down, the rule is installed in the <code>mangle</code> table (for modifying packets) in the chain that handles incoming packets (<code>-A PREROUTING</code>). Only TCP packets with the SYN flag set are considered (<code>-p tcp --syn</code>) where there is no prior state for the connection (<code>--state NEW</code>). The filter selects one in every 10,000 SYN packets (<code>-m statistic –mode random --probability 0.0001</code>) and applies a label to the connection (<code>-m connlabel --label &lt;label&gt; --set</code>).</p><p>The second iptables rule logs subsequent packets in the connection, to a maximum of 10 packets. Again, there’s nothing magic about the number 10 other than that it’s generally enough to capture the connection establishment, subsequent request packets, and resets on connections that close before expected.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">-t mangle -A PREROUTING -m connlabel --label \n&lt;label&gt; -m connbytes ! --connbytes 11 \n--connbytes-dir original --connbytes-mode packets \n-j NFLOG --nflog-prefix &quot;&lt;logging flags&gt;&quot; -m \ncomment --comment &quot;Log the first 10 incoming packets of each sampled ingress connection&quot;\n</pre></code>\n            <p></p><p>This rule is installed in the same chain as the previous rule. It matches only packets from sampled connections <code>(-m connlabel --label &lt;label&gt;)</code>, and only the first 10 packets from each connection (<code>-m connbytes ! --connbytes 11 --connbytes-dir original --connbytes-mode packets</code>). Matched packets are sent to NFLOG (<code>-j NFLOG --nflog-prefix &quot;&lt;logging flags&gt;&quot;</code>) where they’re picked up by the logging system and saved to a centralized location for offline analysis.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"reconstructing-connections-from-sampled-packets\">Reconstructing connections from sampled packets</h2>\n            <a href=\"#reconstructing-connections-from-sampled-packets\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Packets logged on our servers are inserted into <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/clickhouse/\"><u>ClickHouse</u></a> tables as part of our analytics pipeline. Each logged packet is stored in its own row in the database. The next challenge is to reassemble packets into the corresponding connections for further analysis. Before we go further, we need to define what a “connection” is for the purpose of this analysis.</p><p>We use the standard definition of a connection defined by the network 5-tuple of <code>protocol</code>, <code>source IP address</code>, <code>source port</code>, <code>destination IP address</code>, <code>destination port</code> with the following tweaks:</p><ul><li><p>We only sample packets on the <i>ingress</i> (client-to-server) half of a connection, so do not see the corresponding response packets from server to client. In most cases, we can infer what the server response will be based on our knowledge of how our servers are configured. Ultimately, the ingress packets are sufficient to learn anomalous TCP connection behaviors.</p></li><li><p>We query the ClickHouse dataset in 15-minute intervals, and group together packets sharing the same network 5-tuple within that interval. This means that connections may be truncated towards the end of the query interval. When analyzing connection timeouts, we exclude incomplete flows where the latest packet timestamp is within 10 seconds of the query cutoff.</p></li><li><p>Since resets and timeouts are most likely to affect <i>new</i> connections, we only consider sequences of packets starting with a SYN packet marking the beginning of a new TCP handshake. Thus, existing long-lived connections are excluded.</p></li><li><p>The logging system does not guarantee precise packet interarrival timestamps, so we consider only the set of packets that arrive, not ordered by their arrival time.

Considering other factors such as packet inter-arrival timing, exact combinations of TCP flags, and other packet fields (IP identification, IP TTL, TCP sequence and acknowledgement numbers, TCP window size, etc.) can allow for more fine-grained matching to specific behaviors.</p><p>For example, the popular <a href=\"http://zmap.io\"><u>ZMap</u></a> scanner software fixes the IP identification field to 54321 and the TCP window size to 65535 in SYN packets that it generates (<a href=\"https://github.com/zmap/zmap/blob/c88db2917612328c843561101495e5263ef7ac5b/src/probe_modules/packet.c\"><u>source code</u></a>). When we see packets arriving to our network that have these exact fields set, it is likely that the packet was generated by a scanner using ZMap.</p><p>Tags can also be used to match connections against known signatures of tampering middleboxes. A large body of active measurements work (for instance, <a href=\"https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/weav.pdf\"><u>Weaver, Sommer, and Paxson</u></a>) has found that some middleboxes deployments exhibit consistent behaviors when disrupting connections via reset injection, such as setting an IP TTL field that differs from other packets sent by the client, or sending both a RST packet and a RST+ACK packet. For more details on specific connection tampering signatures, see the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/connection-tampering\"><u>blog post</u></a> and the <a href=\"https://research.cloudflare.com/publications/SundaraRaman2023/\"><u>peer-reviewed paper</u></a>.</p><p>Currently, we define the following tags, which we intend to refine and expand over time. Some tags only apply if another tag is also set, as indicated by the hierarchical presentation below (e.g., the <code>fin</code> tag can only apply when the <code>reset</code> tag is also set).</p><ul><li><p><code>timeout</code>: terminated due to a timeout</p></li><li><p><code>reset</code>: terminated due to a reset (packet with RST flag set)</p><ul><li><p>fin: at least one FIN packet was received alongside one or more RST packets</p></li><li><p><code>single_rst</code>: terminated with a single RST packet</p></li><li><p><code>multiple_rsts</code>: terminated with multiple RST packets</p><ul><li><p><code>acknumsame</code>: the acknowledgement numbers in the RST packets were all the same and non-zero</p></li><li><p><code>acknumsame0</code>: the acknowledgement numbers in the RST packets were all zero</p></li><li><p><code>acknumdif</code>f: the acknowledgement numbers in the RST packets were different and all non-zero</p></li><li><p><code>acknumdiff0</code>: the acknowledgement numbers in the RST packets were different and one was zero</p></li></ul></li><li><p><code>single_rstack</code>: terminated with a single RST+ACK packet (both RST and ACK flags set)</p></li><li><p><code>multiple_rstacks</code>: terminated with a multiple RST+ACK packets</p></li><li><p><code>rst_and_rstacks</code>: terminated with a combination of RST and RST+ACK packets</p></li></ul></li><li><p><code>zmap</code>: SYN packet matches those generated by the ZMap scanner</p></li></ul><p>Connection tags are not currently visible in the Radar <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/security-and-attacks#tcp-resets-and-timeouts\"><u>dashboard</u></a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-get-tcp-resets-timeouts-summary\"><u>API</u></a>, but we plan to release this additional functionality in the future.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare’s mission is to help build a better Internet, and we consider transparency and accountability to be a critical part of that mission.
