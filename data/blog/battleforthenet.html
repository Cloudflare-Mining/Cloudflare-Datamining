	<p><b>TL;DR</b> - Net neutrality is under attack. There's <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/net-neutrality">an app</a> on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps">Cloudflare Apps</a> that empowers site owners to host a popup on their sites, encouraging users to contact their congresspeople to fight back. Everyone should be doing this right now, before the December 14th FCC vote.</p>

	<p>The <a href="https://www.fcc.gov">Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</a> has scheduled a vote to terminate its net neutrality rules this Thursday, December 14th. Unfortunately, the expectation is that the FCC will vote to repeal its net neutrality rules. Read about this on <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-will-lead-to-higher-prices-fewer-choices-2017-12">Business Insider</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-15/killing-net-neutrality-rules-is-said-readied-for-december-vote">Bloomberg</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/16/fcc-reportedly-planning-vote-that-could-kill-net-neutrality-next-month">TechCrunch</a>.</p>
	<p>Net neutrality is the principle that networks should not discriminate against content that passes through them. The FCC’s net neutrality rules protect the Internet, users, and companies from abusive behavior by the largest Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Without net neutrality rules in place, ISPs may be able to legally create a "pay to play" system and charge websites to provide content to their customers more quickly. This will create a disadvantage for startups, bloggers, and everyone else who cannot afford to pay fees for their websites to offer faster service.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> founders and employees strongly believe in the principle of network neutrality. Cloudflare co-founder and COO <a href="https://twitter.com/zatlyn">Michelle Zatlyn</a>, sat on the FCC's Open Internet Advisory Committee, which guided the FCC to vote to preserve net neutrality in 2015. Cloudflare co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota">Matthew Prince</a> and other employees have written four blog posts <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/moving-beyond-the-dc-circuit-court-decision-on-the-fccs-open-internet-order">1</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/net-neutrality">2</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/net-neutrality-day-of-action">3</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/netneutrality-cloudflare-fftf">4</a>, describing Cloudflare’s views on net neutrality.</p>
	<p>I am extremely disappointed that net neutrality is under threat. I am extremely grateful that I work at a company made of people who are fighting for it and I'm hopeful our community (you) can make a difference.</p>
	<p><b>Read, watch, listen, and learn much more about net neutrality and its importance below.</b></p>
	<p>For now, here is my <a href="https://youtu.be/fpbOEoRrHyU">favorite video explanation</a> of net neutrality, by <a href="http://iamjohnoliver.com">John Oliver</a>, host of <a href="https://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver">Last Week Tonight</a> on HBO.</p>
	<p>---------------- ### Battle for the Net</p>
	<p>Because net neutrality is under attack, the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/net-neutrality">Battle for the Net</a> app is once again live on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps">Cloudflare Apps</a>. The app can be used to “Break the Internet” for the two days before the FCC’s vote, as part of an internet-wide protest.</p>
	<p>This app allows site owners to add a pop-up to their sites that will directly connect users to their respective US congresspeople so they may articulate their stance for net neutrality.</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

	</figure>
	<p>On a site that uses the Battle for the Net app, users are greeted with a pop-up which briefly explains that net neutrality is under attack, displays a countdown to the day and time (Thursday, December 14th) the FCC will vote to terminate the net neutrality rules, and provides an entry field for the user to enter their phone number.</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card ">

	<p>When a user enters their phone number and clicks the "CALL CONGRESS" button, they'll immediately receive an automated phone call from Battle for the Net. The recording instructs the user to enter their zip code, so they'll be connected to their specific congressperson.</p>
	<p>Users may select the option to become a daily caller by pressing 1. This will initiate a process where users will receive calls at the same time each day, connecting them to their congresspeople.</p>
	<p>To make one-time calls, users can just stay on the line. The recording delivers a recommended script to inform the congressperson on the line that the user supports net neutrality and wants the congressperson to contact FCC Chairman Pai and oppose the repeal.</p>
	<p>Here's the written script:</p>
	<p><b>Be polite, introduce yourself, and say: “I support the </b><i><b>existing</b></i><b> Title II net neutrality rules and I would like you to publicly oppose the FCC’s plan to repeal them.”</b></p>
	<p>When done with the first call, users may press * to be directed to another call to their next congressperson.</p>
	<p>I live in San Francisco, so my first call was directed to <a href="https://pelosi.house.gov">Representative Nancy Pelosi</a>. My second call was directed to <a href="https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public">Senator Dianne Feinstein</a>.</p>

	<p>On Cloudflare Apps, you can <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/dvNRF2bh1fgh/install?version=2.0.1">preview</a> Battle for the Net and see how it'd look on a site. Cloudflare users can install the app on their site with the click of a button. You can see how a user can enter a phone number into the pop-up. Users are given share links on their screens, so they may share the action they take on Facebook or Twitter. They are also given the option to donate to the cause.</p>
	<p>Though the pop-up covers a significant portion of the page, it can be easily discarded by clicking the "x" in the upper right corner.</p>

	<p><b>Key moments for </b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States"><b>Net Neutrality</b></a></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>The 1990's: The issue of net neutrality has been a discussion since the early days of the Internet in the 1990s, between users and service providers. There were no clear legal protections requiring net neutrality until 2015.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>2015: The FCC classified broadband as a Title II communication service with providers being "common carriers", not "information providers", under former <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwheelerfcc?lang=en">Chairman Tom Wheeler</a>. Adoption of this notion would reclassify Internet service from one of information to one of telecommunications and ensure net neutrality. Wheeler stated, "This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. They both stand for the same concept." Read more about the 2015 rules in <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/fcc-passes-new-rules-net-neutrality-and-municipal-broadband-309715">this Newsweek article</a>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>January, 2017: Ajit Pai was named the new Chairman of the FCC by President Trump. Pai opposed the 2015 <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A1.pdf">Open Internet Order</a> which protects and promotes the open Internet and stated the he planned to modernize FCC policies. Read about Pai's October Senate confirmation in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/senate-confirms-ajit-pai-as-fcc-chairman">this TechCrunch article</a>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>April/May, 2017: Pai <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-344614A1.pdf">proposed</a> Net neutrality rules be rolled back and service providers instead should voluntarily commit to net neutrality principles. On May 18, 2017 the FCC voted to move forward with the proposal. Over 1,000 companies and investors signed an open letter, opposing the proposal and millions of public pro net neutrality comments were submitted on the FCC website. Read more about the vote in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/18/technology/fcc-net-neutrality-vote/index.html">this CNN article</a>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>June/July, 2017: The Battle for the Net coalition created a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3207564/internet/net-neutrality-the-july-12-internet-wide-day-of-action-protest.html">Day of Action</a> during which over 50,000 websites participated in the largest online protest in history. Internet companies, CEOs, politicians, and users spoke out in support of net neutrality.</p>
