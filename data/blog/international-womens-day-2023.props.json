Offering “Laughter as a Service (LaaS),” they will deliver stand-up comedy, musical comedy, and other comedic activities for a celebratory “Workplace Variety Hour.”</p></li><li><p><b>Equity and allyship chats:</b> After our celebrations, we are opening forums to discuss equity and what this means for each of us in our unique intersectionalities. We have invited some of our fellow employee resource group leads from Asianflare, Nativeflare, and Proudflare to share with us and dive into how we can be both supported and supportive.</p></li><li><p><b>Equity leadership panel:</b> Our internal leadership panels were always well received in previous years, so we decided not to mess with a good thing. This year, we will be inviting another group of inspirational women leaders in Cloudflare to share their experiences with us and explore the areas where we can promote equity in the workplace.</p></li><li><p><b>And more:</b> We have so much more planned for March! From Book Club and meetups to <a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/schedule?date=2023-03-09&view=week&tags=Womenflare\">Cloudflare TV</a> episodes and networking events, we are partnering across teams to ensure there are plenty of opportunities to participate and join in on the fun and discussions.</p></li></ul><p>No matter how you plan to celebrate International Women’s Day and Women’s History Month, consider how you can do your part to champion an equitable world.
