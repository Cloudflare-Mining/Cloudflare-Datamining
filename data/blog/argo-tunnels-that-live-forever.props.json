However, external IP addresses can provide attackers with a path around Cloudflare security if they discover those destinations.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1SytOc3A5w9c9ruinpHR5V/eb39001a465279b6d27c451328e46de0/BDES-1096_Argo-Tunnel-Diagram_1_3x-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1754\" height=\"975\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We launched <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/\">Argo Tunnel</a> as a secure way to connect your origin to Cloudflare without a publicly routable IP address. With Tunnel, you don’t send traffic to an external IP. Instead, a lightweight daemon runs in your infrastructure and creates outbound-only connections to Cloudflare’s edge. With Argo Tunnel, you can quickly deploy infrastructure in a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust model</a> by ensuring all requests to your resources pass through Cloudflare’s security filters.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4sjwbzgxbO2pusIoHeAVhc/5c754e9cccf7250aedaab8caed544e92/image6-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1639\" height=\"616\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Originally, your Argo Tunnel connection corresponded to a DNS record in your account. Requests to that hostname hit Cloudflare’s network first and our edge sends those requests over the Argo Tunnel to your origin. Since these connections are outbound-only, you no longer need to poke holes in your infrastructure’s firewall. Your origins can serve traffic through Cloudflare without being vulnerable to attacks that bypass Cloudflare.</p><p>However, fitting an outbound-only connection into a reverse proxy creates some ergonomic and stability hurdles. The original Argo Tunnel architecture attempted to both manage DNS records and create connections. When connections became disrupted, Argo Tunnel would recreate the entire deployment. Additionally, Argo Tunnel connections could not be treated like regular origin servers in Cloudflare’s control plane and had to be managed directly from the server-side software.</p><p>Today, we’re introducing a new architecture that treats Argo Tunnel connections like a true origin server without the risk of exposure to the rest of the Internet. Now, when you create a Tunnel connection, you can point DNS records for any hostname in your account, or load balancer pools, to that connection from the Cloudflare dashboard. You can also run Argo Tunnel connections without the need for leaving certificates and service tokens on your servers.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"keeping-persistent-objects-persistent\">Keeping persistent objects persistent</h2>\n            <a href=\"#keeping-persistent-objects-persistent\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Argo Tunnel has objects that tend to stay persistent (DNS records) and objects that deliberately change and recreate (connections from `cloudflared` to Cloudflare).

That service registers your Tunnel and its connections.</p></li><li><p><code>cloudflared</code> creates a public DNS record for your hostname which points to a randomly generated CNAME record for load balanced Tunnels or an IPv6 for traditional Tunnels. The ephemeral CNAME record represents your Tunnel.</p></li><li><p>The control plane then tells Cloudflare’s edge about these DNS entries and where the CNAME or IP address should send traffic. Traffic can now be routed to cloudflared.</p></li><li><p>If the Tunnel disconnects, for any reason, the Argo Tunnel service unregistered the Tunnel and deleted the DNS record.</p></li></ol><p>The last step is an issue. In most cases, you create an Argo Tunnel for a service meant to run indefinitely. The DNS record should stay persistent - it’s an app that you manage that should not change. However, a simple restart or disconnection meant that <code>cloudflared</code> had to follow every step and start itself from scratch. If any of those upstream services were degraded, the Tunnel would fail to reconnect.</p><p>This model also introduces other shortcomings. You cannot gracefully change the DNS record of a Tunnel; instead, you had to stop <code>cloudflared</code> and rerun the service. Visibility was limited. Load balancing introduced complications with how origins were counted.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"phase-1-improving-stability\">Phase 1: Improving stability</h2>\n            <a href=\"#phase-1-improving-stability\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>The team started by reducing the impact of those dependencies.

DNS records became tied to those connections and could not be changed.

Since the name and UUID do not change, your DNS record never needs to be cleaned up or recreated when Argo Tunnel restarts. In the event of a restart, the enrolled instance of <code>cloudflared</code> connects back to that UUID address.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/55YI6NBGZfIqhXszVA7puK/86dec8293a9df2912a911a3adc005910/image9-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1639\" height=\"433\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>You can also treat named Argo Tunnels like origin servers in this architecture - except these origins can only be connected to via a DNS record in your account.
