R2&#39;s architecture is composed of multiple components including:</p><ul><li><p><b>R2 Gateway Worker: </b>The entry point for all API requests that handles authentication and routing logic. It is deployed across Cloudflare&#39;s global network via <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/\"><u>Cloudflare Workers</u></a>.</p></li><li><p><b>Durable Object Metadata Service: </b>A distributed layer built on <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/\"><u>Durable Objects</u></a> used to store and manage object metadata (e.g. object key, checksum).</p></li><li><p><b>Distributed Storage Infrastructure: </b>The underlying infrastructure that persistently stores encrypted object data.</p></li></ul><p>Without Local Uploads, here’s what happens when you upload objects to your bucket: The request is first received by the R2 Gateway, close to the user, where it is authenticated. Then, as the client streams bytes of the object data, the data is encrypted and written into the storage infrastructure in the region where the bucket is placed. When this is completed, the Gateway reaches out to the Metadata Service to publish the object metadata, and it returns a success response back to the client after it is committed.</p><p>If the client and the bucket are in separate regions, more variability can be introduced in the process of uploading bytes of the object data, due to the longer distance that the request must travel. This could result in slower or less reliable uploads. </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6toAZ6JSHPv2jgntdyCOvr/704f6837d2705f18a0e5b8554994cb7a/image9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup>A client uploading from Eastern North America to a bucket in Eastern Europe without Local Uploads enabled. </sup></p><p>Now, when you make an upload request to a bucket with Local Uploads enabled, there are two cases that are handled: </p><ol><li><p>The client and the bucket region are in the <b>same</b> region</p></li><li><p>The client and the bucket region are in <b>different</b> regions</p></li></ol><p>In the first case, R2 follows the regular flow, where object data is written to the storage infrastructure for your bucket. In the second case, R2 writes to the storage infrastructure located in the client region while still publishing to the object metadata to the region of the bucket.</p><p>Importantly, the object is immediately accessible after the initial write completes. It remains accessible throughout the entire replication process — there&#39;s <b>no</b> <b>waiting period</b> for background replication to finish before the object can be read.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/33oUAdlGF8cWOeQhha6Ocy/68537e503f1ec8d1dd080db363f97dc3/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup>A client uploading from Eastern North America to a bucket in Eastern Europe with Local Uploads enabled. </sup></p><p>Note that this is for non-jurisdiction restricted buckets, and Local Uploads are not available for buckets with jurisdiction restriction (e.g. EU, FedRAMP) enabled.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"when-to-use-local-uploads\">When to use Local Uploads</h2>\n      <a href=\"#when-to-use-local-uploads\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Local uploads are built for workloads that receive a lot of upload requests originating from different geographic regions than where your bucket is located.
