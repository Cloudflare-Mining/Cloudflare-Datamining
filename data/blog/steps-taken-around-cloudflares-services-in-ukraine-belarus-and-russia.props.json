Governments around the world have emphasized that organizations must be prepared to respond to disruptive cyber activity. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), for example, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up\">has recommended</a> that all organizations—large and small—go “Shields Up” to protect themselves from attack. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre has <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/organisations-urged-to-bolster-defences\">encouraged</a> organizations to improve their cyber resilience.</p><p>This is where careful monitoring of the attacks in Ukraine is so important. It doesn’t just help our customers in Ukraine — it helps us learn and improve our products so that we can protect all of our customers globally. When wiper malware was identified in Ukraine, for example, we adapted our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust</a> products to make sure our customers were protected.</p><p>We’ve long believed that everyone should have access to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/\">cybersecurity tools</a> to protect themselves, regardless of their size or resources.

Governments have been united in imposing a stream of new sanctions and there have even been some calls to disconnect Russia from the global Internet. As discussed by <a href=\"https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2022/03/why-the-world-must-resist-calls-to-undermine-the-internet/\">ICANN</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/correspondence/marby-to-fedorov-02mar22-en.pdf\">Internet Society</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/wartime-bad-time-mess-internet\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2022/03/02/very-very-bad-ideas-ukraine-asks-icann-to-disconnect-russia-from-the-internet/\">Techdirt</a>, among others, the consequences of such a shutdown would be profound.</p><p>The scope of new sanctions issued in the last few weeks have been unprecedented in their reach, frequency, and the number of different governments involved. Governments have issued sweeping new sanctions designed to impose severe costs against those who supported the invasion of Ukraine, including government entities and officials in Russia and Belarus. Sanctions have been imposed against Russia’s top financial institutions, including Russia’s two largest banks, fundamentally altering the ability of Russians to access capital. The entire break away territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, including all of the residents of those regions, are subject to comprehensive sanctions. We’ve seen sanctions on state-owned enterprises, elite Russian families, and the leaders of intelligence-directed disinformation outlets.</p><p>These sanctions are intended to make sure that those who supported the invasion are held to account. And Cloudflare has taken action to comply. Over the past several years, Cloudflare has developed a robust and comprehensive sanctions compliance program that allows us to track and take immediate steps to comply with new sanctions regulations as they are implemented. In addition to an internal compliance team and outside counsel, we employ third party tools to flag potential matches or partial ownership by sanctioned parties, and we review reports from third-parties about potential connections. We have also worked with government experts inside and outside the United States to identify when there is a connection between a sanctioned entity and a Cloudflare account.</p><p>Over the past week, our team has ensured that we are complying with these new sanctions as they are announced. We have closed off paid access to our network and systems in the new comprehensively-sanctioned regions. And we have terminated any customers we have identified as tied to sanctions, including those related to Russian financial institutions, Russian influence campaigns, and the Russian-affiliated Donetsk and Luhansk governments. We’ve never had any offices or employees located in Russia, and we have taken steps to prevent the company from making any payments for things like taxes or fees to the Russian government. We expect additional sanctions are likely to come from governments as they determine additional steps are appropriate, and we will continue to move quickly to comply with those requirements as they are announced.</p><p>Beyond this, we have received several calls to terminate all of Cloudflare&#39;s services inside Russia. We have carefully considered these requests and discussed them with government and civil society experts. Our conclusion, in consultation with those experts, is that Russia needs more Internet access, not less.</p><p>As the conflict has continued, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in requests from Russian networks to worldwide media, reflecting a desire by ordinary Russian citizens to see world news beyond that provided within Russia.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4MSNhXX3NDNjHSfJlBr0TT/4215bc0f344fe3ba2523ca59e4a309ed/image2-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1961\" height=\"535\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We’ve also seen an increase in Russian blocking and throttling efforts, combined with Russian efforts to control the content of the media operating inside Russia with a new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22961472/russia-fake-news-law-military-ukraine-invasion-casualties-jail-time\">“fake news” law.</a></p><p>The Russian government itself, over the last several years, has threatened repeatedly to block certain Cloudflare <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/legal/russian-internet-watchdog-announces-ban-of-six-more-vpn-products/\">services</a> and customers. Indiscriminately terminating service would do little to harm the Russian government, but would both limit access to information outside the country, and make significantly more vulnerable those who have used us to shield themselves as they have criticized the government.</p><p>In fact, we believe the Russian government would celebrate us shutting down Cloudflare&#39;s services in Russia. We absolutely appreciate the spirit of many Ukrainians making requests across the tech sector for companies to terminate services in Russia. However, when what Cloudflare is fundamentally providing is a more open, private, and secure Internet, we believe that shutting down Cloudflare&#39;s services entirely in Russia would be a mistake.</p><p>Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine and the entire team at Cloudflare prays for a peaceful resolution as soon as possible.</p>",
