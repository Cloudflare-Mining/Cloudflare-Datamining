Thousands of CloudFlare customers installed the app.</p>\n<p>In November, we heard that Apture was shutting down their service, as part of their acquisition by Google. Good for them, but we thought immediately &quot;What can we do for CloudFlare site owners?&quot;</p>\n<p>Our first instinct was to look around for a replacement service, or more than one, but no obvious alternative emerged. And Apture's deadline for turning the service off was set to Tuesday, December 20.</p>\n<p>What to do?</p>\n<h3 id=\"theresponseonedayhackathon\">The Response: One-Day Hackathon</h3>\n<p>Three folks on the CloudFlare team -- Ram, Chris, and Kevin -- decided they could make something similar and useful, given a little bit of time. Offered a single day, as a mini-hackathon, the enthusiastic trio agreed. Our positive experience with <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/favris-is-cloudflare-winner-at-techcrunch-dis\">larger hackathons</a> helped set the model and expectations.</p>\n<p>On December 7, Ram, Chris and Kevin closed the door of a conference room and ignored the rest of the team. They started with pastries and coffee. A clean whiteboard was quickly filled.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/whiteboard-and-pastries.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" title=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\"><noscript><img alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/whiteboard-and-pastries.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" title=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\"></noscript></p>\n<p>Later in the day, brief interruptions were tolerated for delivery of burritos and Red Bull.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/burritos.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" title=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\"><noscript><img alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/burritos.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" title=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\"></noscript></p>\n<p>The team combined several technologies, internal and external, to deliver a simple, polished experience. Free APIs from Bing and DuckDuckGo were explored and put to use. <a href=\"http://js.cloudflare.com/\">CloudFlareJS</a> as a JavaScript loader made performance straightforward.</p>\n<p>Many additional ideas were discussed, but 12 hours isn't much time. The team decided on delivering the core functions of web search, definitions, and (a nice touch) incorporating the &quot;read aloud&quot; benefits of Pronounce, an existing CloudFlare app.</p>\n<p>It was a long day, but ultimately successful for Ram, Chris, and Kevin. And for CloudFlare customers.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/Ram_Chris_Kevin_Finished_Work.JPG.scaled500.jpg\" title=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\"><noscript><img alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/Ram_Chris_Kevin_Finished_Work.JPG.scaled500.jpg\" title=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\"></noscript></p>\n<h3 id=\"theresulthighlight\">The Result: Highlight</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/highlight\">Highlight</a> is a one-click install on your CloudFlare-powered site. Highlight gives your site visitors contextual web search and definitions -- and no one needs to leave your site.<img alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/highlight-detail.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\"><noscript><img alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello\nHighlight\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/highlight-detail.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\"></noscript></p>\n<p>Visitors select a word or phrase, and a quiet tooltip appears, inviting them to seek more info or simply listen to the word or phrase read out loud.</p>\n<h3 id=\"invitationtoapturecustomers\">Invitation to Apture Customers</h3>\n<p>CloudFlare customers looking to replace Apture simply need to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/highlight\">turn on Highlight</a>.</p>\n<p>Not yet a CloudFlare customer? Take five minutes and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/sign-up\">sign up for CloudFlare</a>. And then use CloudFlare Apps to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/highlight\">install Highlight</a> as a worthy replacement to Apture.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
