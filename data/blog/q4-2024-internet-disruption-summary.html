	<p>Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network">network</a> spans more than 330 cities in over 120 countries, where we interconnect with over 13,000 network providers in order to provide a broad range of services to millions of customers. The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions at both a local and national level, as well as at a network level.</p>
	<p>As we have noted in the past, this post is intended as a summary overview of observed and confirmed disruptions, and is not an exhaustive or complete list of issues that have occurred during the quarter. A larger list of detected traffic anomalies is available in the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center#traffic-anomalies"><u>Cloudflare Radar Outage Center</u></a>.</p>
	<p>In the third quarter we covered quite a few <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#government-directed"><u>government-directed Internet shutdowns</u></a>, including many intended to prevent cheating on exams. In the fourth quarter, however, we only observed a single <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#government-directed"><u>government-directed shutdown</u></a>, this one related to protests. Terrestrial <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#cable-cuts"><u>cable cuts</u></a> impacted connectivity in two African countries. As we have seen multiple times before, both unexpected <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#power-outages"><u>power outages</u></a> and rolling power outages following <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#military-action"><u>military action</u></a> resulted in Internet disruptions. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#natural-disasters"><u>Violent storms and an earthquake</u></a> predictably caused Internet outages in the affected countries. And unexpected issues with <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#maintenance"><u>maintenance</u></a> efforts caused outages at two European providers, while Verizon customers in several US states experienced a brief but <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#unknown"><u>unexplained</u></a> outage.</p>

	<p>On October 1, local mobile provider <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as36890"><u>MTN Rwanda (AS36890)</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/MTNRwanda/status/1841092339625865329"><u>published a post on X</u></a> alerting subscribers of a double fiber cut in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/tz"><u>Tanzania</u></a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ug"><u>Uganda</u></a> that may impact connection quality. As a result of these fiber cuts, Internet traffic began to drop sharply after 12:45 local time (10:45 UTC), with a full outage visible between 13:15 - 13:30 local time (11:15 - 11:30 UTC). Traffic then began to rapidly recover, recovering to expected levels around 19:00 local time (17:00 UTC). Several hours later, MTN Rwanda <a href="https://x.com/MTNRwanda/status/1841201775493464174"><u>published a followup post</u></a> confirming that all services had been restored.</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://afterfibre.nsrc.org"><u>African Undersea and Terrestrial Fibre Optic Cables (AfTerFibre) map</u></a> shows that in addition to connecting with networks to the north and south in Tanzania and Uganda, it appears that connections are also available through networks to the west in the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/cd"><u>Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)</u></a>. However, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as36890#connectivity"><u>MTN Rwanda’s upstream providers and/or peers</u></a> may not be routing traffic through DRC-based networks, meaning that they couldn’t be used as a backup path when the apparently simultaneous fiber cuts occurred.</p><iframe width="800" height="456" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/HttpTrafficXY?dateStart=2024-10-01&amp;dateEnd=2024-10-01&amp;location=as36890&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.highlightedSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - HTTP traffic" loading="lazy"></iframe>

	<p>On November 30, local mobile provider <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as37531"><u>Airtel Niger (AS37531)</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/airtelniger/status/1862936319824888015"><u>posted a thread of messages</u></a> on X apologizing for Internet service disruptions, explaining that (translated) “<i>Indeed, due to a simultaneous interruption on the national optical fiber on the Niamey-Dosso, Niamey-Balleyara exits, our internet services are completely interrupted throughout the territory, beyond our control.</i>” These simultaneous fiber cuts resulted in a near complete outage between 17:30 local time (16:30 UTC) on November 29 until 19:45 local time (18:45 UTC) on November 30.</p>
	<p>It seems unusual that the message thread was not posted until after the outage was resolved. It is possible that Airtel Niger themselves had no backup connectivity, and could not post an update until connectivity was restored. Alternately, given that the first post of the thread starts with “<i>[COMMUNIQUÉ IMPORTANT📢]</i>” (“<i>[IMPORTANT PRESS RELEASE 📢 ]</i>”), it is possible that the alert and apology was communicated through more official channels, such as Airtel’s website, in a timely manner, with the thread on X simply a follow-up once Internet services were again available.</p><iframe width="800" height="456" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/HttpTrafficXY?dateStart=2024-11-29&amp;dateEnd=2024-11-30&amp;location=as37531&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.highlightedSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - HTTP traffic" loading="lazy"></iframe>

	<p>Instability in a country’s electrical infrastructure often causes widespread power outages, which, in turn, disrupt Internet connectivity. This happened on October 18 in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/cu"><u>Cuba</u></a>, where a <a href="https://x.com/EnergiaMinasCub/status/1847315612738978114"><u>post on X from the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Cuba</u></a> noted (translated) “<i>Following the unexpected disconnection of the Antonio Guiteras CTE, the National Electricity System was completely disconnected at 11 a.m. today. The Unión Eléctrica is working on its restoration.</i>” The power outage caused Internet traffic within the country to drop by more than half within minutes (15:15 UTC). Connectivity was disrupted for approximately three-and-a-half days, as it returned to expected levels around 23:00 local time on October 21 (03:00 UTC on October 22).</p>
	<p>The Ministry posted several status updates on October 19 and 20, covering the work being done to restore power across the country. A <a href="https://x.com/OSDE_UNE/status/1848812241979916598"><u>final X post on October 22</u></a> signaled the end of the power outage, proclaiming (translated) “<i>At 02:44 pm the National Electric System was synchronized.</i>”</p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/HttpTrafficXY?dateStart=2024-10-17&amp;dateEnd=2024-10-23&amp;location=cu&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.highlightedSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - HTTP traffic" loading="lazy"></iframe>
	<p>Several weeks later, power issues again impacted Internet connectivity in Cuba. On November 6, <a href="https://x.com/OSDE_UNE/status/1854252013212844461"><u>the Electrical Union of Cuba (Uníon Eléctrica) posted on X</u></a> that (translated) “<i>14:48 hours. Strong winds caused by the intense Hurricane Rafael, cause the disconnection of the National Electric System. Contingency protocols are applied.</i>” The timing of this post aligns with a sharp decline in traffic observed from Cuba, which fell sharply around 14:30 local time (19:30 UTC). Over the following days, after Hurricane Rafael passed the island, the Uníon Eléctrica posted numerous updates on the restoration of electrical service. Internet traffic appeared to return to expected levels around 13:00 local time (18:00 UTC) on November 9, although full restoration of electrical services took several days longer.</p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/HttpTrafficXY?dateStart=2024-11-04&amp;dateEnd=2024-11-10&amp;location=cu&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.highlightedSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - HTTP traffic" loading="lazy"></iframe>
	<p>On December 4, Cuba suffered its third nationwide power outage in as many months. Early that morning, the <a href="https://x.com/EnergiaMinasCub/status/1864220455139168538"><u>Ministry of Energy and Mines posted on X</u></a> that (translated) “<i>At 2:08 this morning, the Electrical System, SEN, was disconnected when the Antonio Guiteras thermoelectric plant went out due to the automatic tripping.</i>” The loss of this electrical power due to the failure of this generation plant caused a significant drop in Internet traffic from Cuba, falling approximately 60% as compared to the previous week at just before 02:15 local time (07:15 UTC). Traffic recovered to expected levels almost a day later at around 00:30 local time (05:30 UTC). This timing aligns with a <a href="https://x.com/EnergiaMinasCub/status/1864542875255541780"><u>follow-on X post from the Ministry</u></a> that announced that all units had been synchronized, signaling a restoration of electrical service.</p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/HttpTrafficXY?dateStart=2024-12-01&amp;dateEnd=2024-12-07&amp;location=cu&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.highlightedSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - HTTP traffic" loading="lazy"></iframe>

	<p>An article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/25/guadeloupe-power-outage-strike"><u>published in The Guardian</u></a> on October 25 noted that “<i>The French Caribbean island of </i><a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/gp"><i><u>Guadeloupe</u></i></a><i> has been left entirely without power after striking workers seized control of the territory’s power station.</i>” Workers entered the power station’s command room “<i>and caused an emergency shutdown of all the engines</i>”, according to the article.

	<p>At 20:30 local time on October 9 (00:30 UTC on October 10), <a href="https://www.weather.gov/mlb/HurricaneMilton_Impacts"><u>Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida</u></a> as a Category 3 storm. Damage from Milton was extensive, including flooding, downed trees and power lines, and damage to homes and businesses. The power outages and other infrastructure damage caused by the storm, coupled with evacuation from impacted areas, resulted in a notable Internet disruption at a state level. As seen in the graph below, peak traffic levels on October 10, after Milton’s arrival, were approximately 40% lower than the preceding days. As recovery and restoration efforts began over the following days, and as evacuees returned to home, school, and work, the state’s Internet traffic began to gradually increase.</p>

	<p>A <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000nzf3/executive"><u>magnitude 7.3 earthquake</u></a> struck 24 km WNW of Port-Vila, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/vu"><u>Vanuatu</u></a> at 17:46 local time (01:47 UTC) on December 17. Internet traffic from the country dropped sharply almost immediately, falling nearly 90% compared to the previous week. A significant drop in announced IPv4 address space was also observed, suggesting that damage from the earthquake took core network provider infrastructure offline as well. Recovery was slow, with Internet traffic not returning to expected levels until around 23:00 local time (12:00 UTC) on December 26.</p>
	<p>An <a href="https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/vanuatu-illustrates-risks-of-thin-subsea-cable-infrastructure"><u>editorial published on The Maritime Executive</u></a> website highlights that Vanuatu is currently reliant on the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/interchange-cable-network-1-icn1"><u>Interchange Cable Network 1 (ICN1) submarine cable</u></a> connection to <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/fj"><u>Fiji</u></a> for international Internet connectivity. The editorial states that “<i>A fire at the cable landing station temporarily interrupted the power supply, disabling internet traffic. The connection was restored 10 days later…</i>” The resolution of the power outage at the cable landing station roughly aligns with traffic returning to expected levels, suggesting that this was a significant driver of the drop in traffic seen from Vanuatu after the earthquake. Starlink’s satellite Internet service provides some nominal redundancy, as <a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1843395755547209765"><u>the company announced service availability</u></a> on October 7. The <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/tamtam"><u>TAMTAM submarine cable</u></a>, connecting Vanuatu to <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/nc"><u>New Caledonia</u></a>, is expected to be ready for service in 2026 — once available, it will provide additional redundancy for Internet connectivity.&nbsp;</p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/HttpTrafficXY?dateStart=2024-12-15&amp;dateEnd=2024-12-28&amp;location=vu&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.highlightedSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - HTTP traffic" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe class="cf-radar-embed" width="800" height="438" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/BgpAnnouncedIpAddressSpaceXY?dateStart=2024-12-15&amp;dateEnd=2024-12-28&amp;location=vu&amp;widgetState=%7B%22bgpSignalsMinMax%22%3Afalse%2C%22bgpSignalsIpVersionParam%22%3A%22ipv4%22%2C%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.highlightedSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.hoveredSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D&amp;ref=%2Frouting%2Fvu" title="Cloudflare Radar - Announced IP Address Space" loading="lazy" style="border:0;max-width:100%;"></iframe>

According to a <a href="https://aimnews.org/2024/11/11/internet-shutdown-to-prevent-destruction-of-country"><u>published report</u></a>, the country’s Minister of Transport and Communications “admitted that Internet access was restricted in order ‘to avoid the destruction of the country’”, but shifted blame to the impacted services providers, claiming that when they note misuse of their services, they can take the initiative of interrupting the services, as part of their “civil responsibility” to safeguard “the stability and welfare of the population”.</p><iframe width="800" height="456" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/HttpTrafficXY?dateStart=2024-11-02&amp;dateEnd=2024-11-08&amp;location=as30619&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.highlightedSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - HTTP traffic" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/HttpTrafficXY?dateStart=2024-11-02&amp;dateEnd=2024-11-08&amp;location=as37342&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.highlightedSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - HTTP traffic" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/HttpTrafficXY?dateStart=2024-11-02&amp;dateEnd=2024-11-08&amp;location=as37223&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.highlightedSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - HTTP traffic" loading="lazy"></iframe>

As we have seen multiple times throughout the nearly three-year-old conflict, these power outages result in disruptions to Internet traffic, impacting both service provider infrastructure and subscriber connectivity.</p>
	<p>During the period between 07:30 local time (05:30 UTC) on November 17 and 02:00 local time (00:00 UTC) on November 23, <a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1858512061816275381"><u>we observed lower Internet traffic as compared to the previous week</u></a> in Odessa, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and Sumy. Traffic in Odessa initially dropped on November 17 by around 50% as compared to the prior week, while on November 18, traffic dropped by over 20% in the other regions. Traffic largely recovered in Odessa by November 21, while <a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1859693864539558225"><u>the other regions took several additional days</u></a>.</p>

The post noted “<i>This happened because preventive maintenance was to be done on the connections in Canada between 02:00 and 06:00 last night, but with a combined fault on our connection to Denmark we lost nationwide connectivity. Fortunately, the fault on the connection to Denmark occurred on land, and therefore easy to repair.</i>” The graphs below show that for the duration of the outage, traffic from the network dropped to zero, no IPv6 address space was announced, and the volume of announced IPv4 address space fell by 94%.</p>

	<p>Very early in the morning of November 12, some subscribers of Verizon’s Fios Internet service experienced a disruption to their Internet connectivity. A <a href="https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2024-November/015342.html"><u>post to the Outages mailing list</u></a> noted that a major multi-state Verizon Fios outage began at 12:28am EST, impacting Virginia, Washington DC, Maryland, and New Jersey, as well as parts of eastern Pennsylvania. Traffic from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as701"><u>AS701</u></a>, the autonomous system used by Verizon for their Fios service, dropped by approximately 30% around 00:30 Eastern time (05:30 UTC). At a state level, traffic from AS701 dropped between 50-70% in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Washington DC.</p>
	<p>A subsequent post on the Outages mailing list stated that the outage was resolved everywhere at 3:23am EST (08:23 UTC). Nearly six hours after the outage ended, <a href="https://x.com/VerizonSupport/status/1856334754888438158"><u>Verizon Support published a post on X</u></a> acknowledging the issue, stating “<i>A network issue early this morning disrupted service for some Verizon Fios customers in the Northeast for a short period of time. As soon as the issue was identified, our engineering teams quickly restored the service.</i>” However, they did not provide any information on what ultimately caused the service disruption.</p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/HttpTrafficXY?dateStart=2024-11-12&amp;dateEnd=2024-11-12&amp;location=as701&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.highlightedSeries%22%3Anull%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - traffic.requests.title" loading="lazy"></iframe>

	<p>In addition to the outages and disruptions covered above, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/resilient-internet-connectivity-baltic-cable-cuts"><u>resilient Internet connectivity</u></a> meant that two Baltic Sea cable cuts that occurred on November 17 and 18 had minimal impact. Whether <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/baltic-subsea-cable-damage-was-accidental-not-sabotage-us-and-european-officials"><u>accidental or sabotage</u></a>, the security and resiliency of submarine cable infrastructure continues to be <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nato-launches-baltic-sentry-for-subsea-cable-security"><u>an important topic</u></a>. The security and resilience of terrestrial cable infrastructure, as well as other critical Internet infrastructure, must also remain top of mind to help speed recovery from storms, earthquakes, military action, and power outages.</p>
