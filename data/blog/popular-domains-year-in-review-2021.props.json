We’ll also take a little ‘bite’ on video streaming wars. <b>Netflix is a Squid Game of its own</b> and January 2021 was at the highest in our ranking — probably lockdown and pandemic-related.</p><p>Chat domains (<b>WhatsApp, what else</b>) will also be present and, of course, the less established metaverse domains of sorts (<b>Roblox took the lead from Fortnite late in the game</b>). Come with us, let’s travel through 2021.</p><p>The following will show the way Cloudflare saw Internet traffic focusing on specific domains (some of which have many websites aggregated into them) and their highs and lows in our global popularity ranking.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"top-sites-google-dethroned-by-the-young-padawan-tiktok\">Top Sites: Google dethroned by the young ‘padawan’ TikTok</h2>\n      <a href=\"#top-sites-google-dethroned-by-the-young-padawan-tiktok\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Let’s start with our Top Domains Ranking and 2021 brought us a very interesting duel for the Number 1 spot in our global ranking.

Back in March, TikTok got a few more days and also in May, but it was after August 10, 2021, that TikTok took the lead on most days.

For example, Facebook.com was steadily number #2 across 2020, but with TikTok.com going up Facebook is now a solid #3, followed by Microsoft.com (Office365 and Teams numbers are included there) and by Apple.com (App Store and Apple TV+ numbers are included), the same trend as in 2020.</p><p>Amazon.com is the juggernaut that follows, but it is interesting to see that since January 2021 the e-commerce website (we will talk more about that category in a few paragraphs) jumped in front of Apple.com. But Apple got back in front, after September, with some exceptions like November 28, 2021, the day before Cyber Monday — and also December 1 and 6.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"christmas-time-netflix-time\">Christmas time, Netflix time</h3>\n      <a href=\"#christmas-time-netflix-time\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2ZkhP40Hgw2mAGcvxq0fel/e687ffe1ee8e8f993c16cb416de3276c/image3-49.png\" alt=\"Netflix had a great 2020 Christmas but also January 2021, especially at the weekend\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"846\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Netflix had a great 2020 Christmas but also January 2021, especially at the weekend</i></p><p>Another trend is that Netflix surpassed Amazon in December 2020, especially around Christmas week.

Internet traffic. In our ranking, Netflix is still the undefeated hero.</p><p>We added YouTube.com (its most important service is free) to the list to compare with the big numbers from Netflix, and still, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game\">Squid Game phenomenon</a> platform won our ranking for most of the year. Amazon Prime is not included because the streaming service mainly uses Amazon.com (ranked #5 or #6 most of the year) as a domain.</p><p>The days of the year when Netflix was more popular? January was a great month with Netflix reaching the #4 spot in our global ranking in the first two days of the year (and also all the weekends of January, Fridays included), going through February in the #5 place. For the rest of 2021, the platform was mostly #7. Yes, on the weekends Netflix seems to have a better performance in our ranking.</p><p>Roku.com seems to be the next video streaming platform after those two traffic giants, getting around the #80 position in our ranking through 2021. In late 2020 Hulu.com was the next one, but HBOMax.com surpassed Hulu in July 2021 and entered our top 100 list. In 2021, Disneyplus.com also rose in our ranking and surpassed the app-based TV service Sling.com later in the year.
