We are about to shake things up a bit here at Cloudflare and wanted to give you a heads-up, so that you know what we are doing and where we are going. You might know Cloudflare as one of the best places to come to when you need to protect, speed up, or scale your web application, but increasingly Cloudflare is also becoming the best place to <i>deploy and run</i> your application!</p><p><b>Why deploy your application to Cloudflare?</b> Two simple reasons. First, it removes lots of hassle of managing many separate systems and allows you to develop, deploy, monitor, and tune your application all in one place. Second, by deploying to Cloudflare directly, there is so much more we can do to optimize your application and get it to the hands, ears, or eyes of your users more quickly and smoothly.</p><p><b>So what’s changing?</b> Quite a bit, actually. I’m not going to bore you with rehashing all the details as my most-awesome colleagues have written separate blog posts with all the details, but here is a high level rundown.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"cloudflare-workers-pages-awesome-development-platform\">Cloudflare Workers + Pages = awesome development platform</h3>\n      <a href=\"#cloudflare-workers-pages-awesome-development-platform\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare Pages and Workers are merging into a single unified development and application hosting platform that offers:</p><ul><li><p>Super low latency globally: your static assets and compute are less than <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">50ms away from 95% of the world’s Internet-connected population</a>.</p></li><li><p>Free egress including free static asset hosting.</p></li><li><p>Standards-based JavaScript and WASM runtime that already serves over 10 million requests per second at peak globally.</p></li><li><p>Access to powerful features like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/\">R2</a> (object storage with an S3-compatible API), low-latency globally replicated <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/\">KV storage</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/\">Queues</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/\">D1 database</a>, and many more.</p></li><li><p>Support for GitOps and CI/CD workflows and preview environments to boost development velocity.</p></li><li><p>… and so much more.</p></li></ul><p>While mathematically proven to be wrong, we stubbornly believe that 1+1=3, and in this case this translates to Cloudflare Pages + Workers = way more than the sum of the parts.

It enables a new compute paradigm on our platform, unmatched by any other application hosting providers today. Do you have a typical full-stack application built with one of the many popular web frameworks? This feature is for you! And it works with both Workers and Pages!</p><p>While previously we always executed all applications at the “edge” of our global network — meaning, as close to the user as possible. With smart placement, we intelligently determine the best location within our network where the compute (your application) should run. We do this by observing your application’s behavior and what other network resources or endpoints the application interacts with. We then transparently spawn your application at an optimal location, usually close to where your data is stored, and route the incoming requests via our network to this location.</p><p>Smart placement enables applications to run near to the data these applications need to get stuff done. This is especially powerful for applications that interact with databases, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-object-storage/\">object stores</a>, or other backend endpoints, especially if these are centralized and not globally distributed.</p><p>Your user or clients requests still enter our lightning fast network in one of our 285+ datacenters in the world, close to their current location, but instead of spawning the application right there, we route the request to the most optimal datacenter, the one that is near the data or backend system the application talks to.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that compute at the edge is not cool anymore! It is! There are still many use-cases where running your application at the edge makes sense, and smart placement will determine this scenario and keep the application at the edge if that’s the right place for it to be. A/B testing, localization, asset serving, and others are use-cases that should almost always happen at the edge.</p><p>Sounds interesting?

This includes all full-stack web frameworks like Angular, Astro, Next, Nuxt, Qwik, Remix, Solid, Svelte, Vue, and others.</p><p>Our overall mission is to help build a better Internet, and my team’s contribution to this mission is to enable developers, but really just about anyone, to go from an idea to a deployed application in no time.</p><p>To enable developers to turn their ideas into deployed applications quickly and without any hassle we’ve built two things.</p><p>First, we partnered with many web framework authors to build new or improve existing adapters for all the popular JavaScript web frameworks. These adapters ensure that your application runs on our platform in the most efficient way, while having access to all the capabilities and features of our platform.</p><p>These adapters include the highly <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/\">requested Next.js adapter</a>, that we’ve just overhauled to be production ready and are launching 1.0.0 today! In partnership with the respective teams, we’ve built brand-new adapters for <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare/src/frameworks/angular\">Angular</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/dario-piotrowicz/qwik/tree/main/starters/adaptors/cloudflare-pages\">Qwik</a>, while improving Astro, Nuxt, Solid, and a few others.</p><p>Second, we developed a brand new sassy CLI we call C3 — short for create-cloudflare CLI, a sibling to our existing Wrangler CLI. If you are a developer who lives your life in terminal or local editors like VSCode, then this CLI is your single entry-point to the Cloudflare universe.</p><p>Run the C3 command, and we’ll get you started. You pick your framework of choice, we hand the control over to the CLI of the chosen framework as we don’t want to stand in between you and the hard-working framework authors that craft the experience for their framework. A minute or so later once all npm dependencies are installed, you get a URL from us with your application deployed. That’s it. From an idea to a URL that you can share with friends almost instantly!
