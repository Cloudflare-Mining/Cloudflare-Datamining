Usually, when attacks make headlines, it’s because of their size. However, in this case, it’s not the size that is unique but the method that appears to have been borrowed from the world of acoustics.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"acoustic-inspired-attack\">Acoustic inspired attack</h3>\n      <a href=\"#acoustic-inspired-attack\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>As can be seen in the graph below, the attack’s packet rate follows a wave-shaped pattern for over 19 hours. It seems as though the attacker was inspired by an acoustics concept called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28acoustics%29\">beat</a>. In acoustics, a beat is a term that is used to describe an interference of two different wave frequencies. It is the superposition of the two waves. When the two waves are nearly 180 degrees <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_phase\">out of phase</a>, they create the beating phenomenon. When the two waves merge they amplify the sound and when they are out of sync they cancel one another, creating the beating effect.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3lptML3dUmhiTecMKMOwQm/19c85518fcc7ad5e78f5ba6c90f3843f/image24.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1894\" height=\"830\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Beat DDoS Attack</p><p>Acedemo.org has a nice tool where you can create your own beat wave.
