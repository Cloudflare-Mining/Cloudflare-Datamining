It seems as though the attacker was inspired by an acoustics concept called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28acoustics%29\">beat</a>. In acoustics, a beat is a term that is used to describe an interference of two different wave frequencies. It is the superposition of the two waves. When the two waves are nearly 180 degrees <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_phase\">out of phase</a>, they create the beating phenomenon. When the two waves merge they amplify the sound and when they are out of sync they cancel one another, creating the beating effect.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3lptML3dUmhiTecMKMOwQm/19c85518fcc7ad5e78f5ba6c90f3843f/image24.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1894\" height=\"830\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Beat DDoS Attack</p><p>Acedemo.org has a nice tool where you can create your own beat wave.
