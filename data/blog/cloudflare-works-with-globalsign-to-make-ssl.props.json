Prior to that we surveyed nearly every certificate authority in an effort to find one that was forward thinking enough to support what we needed. GlobalSign has been a terrific partner and is shaking up what has been a commodity industry.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6MtTUFv0BJXAuB11ocPMzb/fdf53fe8da2860211e90ca098f8fb204/GlobalSign-His-Res-Logo.png.scaled500.png\" alt=\"CloudFlare Works with GlobalSign to Make SSL Faster Across the Web\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"117\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Several months ago, GlobalSign approached us to talk about SSL performance. Their goal was simple: become the fastest SSL provider on the Internet. As I&#39;ve written about before, whenever you visit a website over a HTTPS connection your browser has to <a href=\"/how-cloudflare-is-making-ssl-fast\">perform a check to see if the certificate has been revoked</a>. Depending on your browser, these checks are either over the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) or OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) protocol. In either case, they require a request be sent back to the certificate authority and to get a response before content is downloaded. In other words, CRL and OCSP requests inherently slow down HTTPS performance.</p><p>The amount that these checks slow down performance varies depending on the certificate authority. On average, across the industry, a typical OCSP or CRL response time can be 500ms. That&#39;s half a second. In other words, every time you visit a site over HTTPS, you waste half a second waiting for the SSL check to complete. Talking with GlobalSign we realized we could do something about that.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"now-saving-1-5-years-worth-of-time-a-day\">Now Saving 1.5 Years Worth of Time a Day</h3>\n      <a href=\"#now-saving-1-5-years-worth-of-time-a-day\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>This morning we officially announced our work with GlobalSign to make their CRL and OCSP requests the fastest on the Internet. GlobalSign&#39;s SSL checks (OCSP and CRL GET and POST requests) are now served from our cache across CloudFlare&#39;s global infrastructure. The results have been awesome. The requests that previously averaging around 500ms are <a href=\"http://unmitigatedrisk.com/?p=147\">now under 100ms</a>. At GlobalSign&#39;s scale, that means we&#39;re now saving the web about a <i>year and a half of time every day</i> that people would have otherwise spent waiting for web pages to load. That&#39;s crazy.</p><p>This improvement accrues to sites using GlobalSign SSL certificates, regardless of whether the sites themselves are running on CloudFlare&#39;s network. Getting more sites using SSL is critical for increasing web security and promoting new performance protocols like SPDY. If you are choosing a CA, typically a commodity decision, now there&#39;s a good reason to pick GlobalSign over the other choices: they will ensure your site is as fast as possible over HTTPS. Put simply, GlobalSign is now the fastest certificate authority in the world, and nearly <a href=\"http://unmitigatedrisk.com/?p=147\">3x as fast as Symantec/Verisign</a>.</p><p>CloudFlare&#39;s mission is to power a faster, safer Internet so working with GlobalSign to make SSL as fast as possible has been a perfect fit. Our hope is that other certificate authorities will follow GlobalSign&#39;s lead and spend the time to optimize their SSL checks for optimal performance. As an added bonus, we&#39;ve also helped GlobalSign be the first certificate authority to have their SSL checks be available over IPv6. This is all part of our efforts to help build a better Internet. As we like to tweet: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23savetheweb\">#savetheweb</a>.</p>",
