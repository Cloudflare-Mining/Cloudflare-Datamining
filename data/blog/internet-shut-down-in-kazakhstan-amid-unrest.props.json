The disruptions and subsequent shutdown happened amid <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59876093\">mass protests</a> against sudden energy price rises.</p><p>Cloudflare Radar shows that the full shutdown happened after 10:30 UTC (16:30 local time). But it was preceded by restrictions to mobile Internet access yesterday.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1sIk0UIhRbhXlVHoNehsAM/23056ba30f3e8875c854e62afdaa533b/image2-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Our data confirm that Kazakhstan’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/\">ASNs</a> were affected after that time (around 18:30 local time). That’s particularly evident with the largest telecommunication company in the country, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhtelecom\">Kazakhtelecom</a>, as the next chart shows.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p></p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4P3GLZknrUYaqSdnmABk4/1eb78bca1f6a3ec4d18cc16f6989f9c4/image4-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"744\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The first disruptions reported affected mobile services, and we can see that at around 14:30 UTC yesterday, January 4, 2022, there was significantly less mobile devices traffic than the day before around the same time. Kazakhstan is a country where mobile represents something like 75% of Internet traffic (shown on <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/kz?date_filter=last_30_days\">Radar</a>), a <a href=\"/where-mobile-traffic-more-and-less-popular/\">usual trend in the region</a>. So mobile disruption has a big impact on the country’s Internet, even before the shutdown that affected almost all connectivity.</p><p>When we focus on other ASNs besides Kazakhtelecom such as the leading mobile Internet services Tele2 or Kcell we can see a big drop in traffic yesterday after 16:00 UTC, confirming local reports. Mobile traffic did not drop to zero which may indicate throttling rather than a full shutdown. Today, however, the Internet, mobile or not, is shut down.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4u2aR2g4m5YoUAWtW88p6E/8283bac71d5f3e5e1370619ecc7da135/image1-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"709\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Looking at <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/\">BGP</a> (Border Gateway Protocol) updates from Kazakhstan’s ASNs around the time of the shutdown, we see a clear spike at exactly the same time the bigger ASNs were affected ~10:45 UTC, January 5, 2022. These update messages are BGP signaling that Kazakhstan’s ASNs are no longer routable, something similar to what we saw happening in <a href=\"/the-gambia-without-internet/\">The Gambia</a> yesterday but for very different reasons.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5o1OUfDxLvdba6TIyB5cQN/cabe15a6bca8ffcb58140fa1977ad006/image3-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1910\" height=\"916\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The Kazakhstan case is similar to other state-imposed <a href=\"/tag/internet-shutdown/\">shutdowns</a> that also happen all too frequently, generally used to deal with situations of <a href=\"/unrest-in-gabon-leads-to-internet-shutdown/\">unrest</a>, <a href=\"/uganda-january-13-2021-internet-shut-down/\">elections</a> or even <a href=\"/sudans-exam-related-internet-shutdowns/\">exams</a>.

The first media website outside Kazakhstan to report it (from what we found) was Tass, the Russian News Agency, at 07:37 UTC.</p><p>Local media websites seem to be offline — <a href=\"http://en.tengrinews.kz/\">en.tengrinews.kz</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ktk-tv.kz/kz/\">ktk-tv.kz/kz</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nur.kz\">nur.kz</a> and the state news agency <a href=\"http://khabar.kz/\">khabar.kz</a> (the more International Astanatimes.com is up, but without updates since Wednesday). Government websites, like <a href=\"https://www.gov.kz/\">gov.kz</a>, are also offline.</p><p>While there seems to be a trend of unblocking some Internet services for a few hours around the time the Kazakh President’s announcements are made, for now, the shutdown continues.</p><p>You can keep an eye on <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/kz?date_filter=last_24_hours\">Cloudflare Radar</a> to monitor this situation as it unfolds.</p>",
