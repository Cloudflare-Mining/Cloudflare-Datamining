The system has come under heavy load because of the societal effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Three years ago Thomson Reuters <a href=\"http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-BANKS-COBOL/010040KH18J/index.html\">reported</a> that COBOL is used in 43% of banking systems, is behind 80% of in-person financial transactions and 95% of times an ATM card is used. They also reported 100s of billions of lines of running COBOL.</p><p>COBOL is often a source of amusement for programmers because it is seen as old, verbose, clunky, and difficult to maintain. And it’s often the case that people making the jokes have never actually written any COBOL. We plan to give them a chance: COBOL can now be used to write code for Cloudflare’s serverless platform Workers.</p><p>Here’s a simple “Hello, World!” program written in COBOL and accessible at <a href=\"https://hello-world.cobol.workers.dev/\">https://hello-world.cobol.workers.dev/</a>.

We decided to use GnuCOBOL (formerly OpenCOBOL) because it&#39;s free software.</p><p>Given that Cloudflare Workers supports WebAssembly, it sounded quite straightforward: GnuCOBOL can compile COBOL to C and Emscripten compiles C/C++ to WebAssembly. However, we need to make sure that our WebAssembly binary is as small and fast as possible to maximize the time for user-code to run instead of COBOL&#39;s runtime.</p><p>GnuCOBOL has a runtime library called libcob, which implements COBOL&#39;s runtime semantics, using GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library) for arithmetic. After we compiled both these libraries to WebAssembly and linked against our compiled COBOL program, we threw the WebAssembly binary in a Cloudflare Worker.</p><p>It was too big and it hit the CPU limit (you can find <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about/limits/#cpu-execution-time-limit\">Cloudflare Worker’s limits</a> here), so it was time to optimize.</p><p>GMP turns out to be a big library, but luckily for us someone made an optimized version for JavaScript (<a href=\"https://github.com/kripken/gmp.js\">https://github.com/kripken/gmp.js</a>), which was much smaller and reduced the WebAssembly instantiation time. As a side note, it&#39;s often the case that functions implemented in C could be removed in favour of a JavaScript implementation already existing on the web platform. But for this project we didn’t want to rewrite GMP.</p><p>While Emscripten can emulate a file system with all its syscalls, it didn&#39;t seem necessary in a Cloudflare Worker. We patched GnuCOBOL to remove the support for local user configuration and other small things, allowing us to remove the emulated file system.</p><p>The size of our Wasm binary is relatively small compared to other languages. For example, around 230KB with optimization enabled for the Game of Life later in this blog post.</p><p>Now that we have a COBOL program running in a Cloudflare Worker, we still need a way to generate an HTTP response.</p><p>The HTTP response generation and manipulation is written in JavaScript (for now... some changes to WebAssembly are currently being discussed that would allow a better integration). Emscripten imports these functions and makes them available in C, and finally we link all the C code with our COBOL program. COBOL already has good interoperability with C code.</p><p>As an example, we implemented the rock-paper-scissors game (<a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cobol-worker/blob/master/src/worker.cob\">https://github.com/cloudflare/cobol-worker/blob/master/src/worker.cob</a>).
