		"html": "<p>Today, one of the greatest challenges that cyber defenders face is analyzing detection hits from indicator feeds, which provide metadata about specific indicators of compromise (IOCs), like IP addresses, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/\"><u>ASNs</u></a>, domains, URLs, and hashes. While indicator feeds have proliferated across the threat intelligence industry, most feeds contain no contextual information about why an indicator was placed on the feed. Another limitation of most feeds today is that they focus solely on blockable indicators and cannot easily accommodate more complex cases, such as a threat actor exploiting a CVE or an insider threat. Instead, this sort of complex threat intelligence is left for long form reporting. However, long-form reporting comes with its own challenges, such as the time required for writing and editing, which can lead to significant delays in releasing timely threat intelligence.</p><p>To help address these challenges, we are excited to launch our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/cloudforce-one/#analyze-threat-events\"><u>threat events platform</u></a> for Cloudforce One customers. Every day, Cloudflare blocks billions of cyber threats. This new platform contains contextual data about the threats we monitor and mitigate on the Cloudflare network and is designed to empower security practitioners and decision makers with actionable insights from a global perspective. </p><p>On average, we process 71 million HTTP requests per second and 44 million DNS queries per second. This volume of traffic provides us with valuable insights and a comprehensive view of current (real-time) threats. The new threat events platform leverages the insights from this traffic to offer a comprehensive, real-time view of threat activity occurring on the Internet, enabling <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cloudforceone/\"><u>Cloudforce One</u></a> customers to better protect their assets and respond to emerging threats.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-we-built-the-threat-events-platform-leveraging-cloudflares-traffic-insights\">How we built the threat events platform leveraging Cloudflare’s traffic insights</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-we-built-the-threat-events-platform-leveraging-cloudflares-traffic-insights\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The sheer volume of threat activity observed across Cloudflare’s network would overwhelm any system or SOC analyst. So instead, we curate this activity into a stream of events that include not only indicators of compromise (IOCs) but also context, making it easier to take action based on Cloudflare’s unique data. To start off, we expose events related to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ddos/\"><u>denial of service</u></a> (DOS) attacks observed across our network, along with the advanced threat operations tracked by our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/cloudforceone/\"><u>Cloudforce One Intelligence team</u></a>, like the various tools, techniques, and procedures used by the threat actors we are tracking. We mapped the events to the <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/\"><u>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</u></a> framework and to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_kill_chain\"><u>cyber kill chain</u></a> stages. In the future, we will add events related to traffic blocked by our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/\"><u>Web Application Firewall</u></a> (WAF), Zero Trust <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/gateway/\"><u>Gateway</u></a>, Zero Trust <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/\"><u>Email Security</u></a> Business Email Compromise, and many other Cloudflare-proprietary datasets. Together, these events will provide our customers with a detailed view of threat activity occurring across the Internet.</p><p>Each event in our threat events summarizes specific threat activity we have observed, similar to a <a href=\"https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/walkthrough#-sighting-object\"><u>STIX2 sighting object</u></a> and provides contextual information in its summary, detailed view and via the mapping to the MITRE ATT&amp;Ck and KillChain stages.

At its core, the platform is a Cloudflare Worker that uses <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/sqlite-in-durable-objects/\"><u>SQLite-backed Durable Objects</u></a> to store events observed on the Cloudflare network. We opted to use Durable Objects over <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/\"><u>D1</u></a>, Cloudflare’s serverless SQL database solution, because it permits us to dynamically create SQL tables to store uniquely customizable datasets. Storing datasets this way allows threat events to scale across our network, so we are resilient to surges in data that might correlate with the unpredictable nature of attacks on the Internet. It also permits us to control events by data source, share a subset of datasets with trusted partners, or restrict access to only authorized users.  Lastly, the metadata for each individual threat event is stored in the Durable Object KV so that we may store contextual data beyond our fixed, searchable fields. This data may be in the form of requests-per-second for our denial of service events, or sourcing information so Cloudforce One analysts can tie the event to the exact threat activity for further investigation.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/P2fP5IBVHYCcytcT3xI3m/f0833512bb5d12b41f350847c368e92a/image5.png\" alt=\"Our Cloudforce One threat events architecture is backed by Durable Objects storage for each of our datasets\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1512\" height=\"433\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-to-use-threat-events\">How to use threat events</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-to-use-threat-events\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudforce One customers can access threat events through the Cloudflare Dashboard in <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/\"><u>Security Center</u></a> or via the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/cloudforce_one/subresources/threat-events/\"><u>Cloudforce One threat events API</u></a>.
