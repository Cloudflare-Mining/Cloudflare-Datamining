A troubleshooting doc might want to send a user to the Page Rules tab in Dashboard to help a user fix their zone, but <i>the linker doesn’t know what that zone is</i>.</p><p>Another highly desired feature was the ability for a deep link to scroll to a particular piece of content on a Dashboard page, making it even easier for users to navigate. Instead of a troubleshooting doc asking a user to fumble around to find a setting, we could helpfully scroll that setting right into view.

Indeed, the :account and :zone symbols are placeholders for user-supplied values, but they can be replaced with any permutation of real, known values to speed up resolution time to provide a better UX.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"deeplink-routing\">DeepLink routing</h3>\n            <a href=\"#deeplink-routing\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>These links are parsed and resolved in our top-level routing component, DeepLink. At a high level, this component contains a series of “resolvers” for unknown symbols that need automatic or user-interactive resolution (i.e. :account and :zone). But before we dive in, let’s take a step back and gain appreciation for how cool this component is.</p><p>Cloudflare’s Dashboard is a single page React app, which means we use React Router to create routing components that handle what’s rendered on different URLs:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\">&lt;Switch&gt;\n  &lt;Route path=&quot;/login&quot;&gt;&lt;Login /&gt;&lt;/Route&gt;\n  &lt;Route path=&quot;/sign-up&quot;&gt;&lt;Signup /&gt;&lt;/Route&gt;\n  ...\n  &lt;AccountRoutes /&gt;\n&lt;/Switch&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>When a page is loaded, a lot of things need to happen: API calls need to be made to fetch all the data needed to render a page, like account/user/zone info not cached in the browser. Many components need to be rendered. It turns out that we can improve the UX of many users by <i>blocking React Router</i> to make specific queries to our API instead of rendering an entire page that anecdotally fetches the information we need. For example, there’s no need to render a zone selection page if a user only has one zone, like in our GIF above ☝️.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"resolvers\">Resolvers</h3>\n            <a href=\"#resolvers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>When a deep link gets parsed and split into parts, the framework iterates over those parts and tries to build a URL string that is later used to redirect users to a specific location in the dashboard.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">// to=/:account/:zone/traffic\n// parts = [‘:account’, ‘:zone’, ‘traffic’]\nfor (const part of parts) {\n  // do something with each part\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>We can build up the dynamic URL by looking at prefixes.

It has access to previously resolved values, and to all other parts of the deep link. It also has functions to help with user interactions.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"user-interactions\">User interactions</h3>\n            <a href=\"#user-interactions\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In many cases, a resolver is not able to resolve without the user&#39;s help.

And Redux has an API to subscribe to any store changes - <code>store.subscribe(listener)</code>.</p><p>The listener will be called any time an action is dispatched, and some part of the state tree may have changed. Unfortunately, the listener does not have access to the currently dispatched action. We can only read the current state.</p><p>Solution? Store the action in the Redux store!</p><p>Redux actions are just plain objects (mostly), and thus easy to serialize. We added a simple reducer that stores all actions in the Redux state.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\">export function deepLinkReducer(\n  state: State = DEFAULT_STATE,\n  action: AnyAction\n){\n  const nextState = { ... state, lastAction: action };\n  return nextState;\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>Anytime an action is dispatched, we can read that action’s metadata in <code>store.getState().lastAction</code>. Now, we have everything we need to finally implement <code>waitForPageAction</code>.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\">export function waitForPageAction = (store: Store&lt;DashState&gt;) =&gt;(\n  pageToAwaitActionOn: string,\n  actionType: string\n) =&gt;\n  new Promise&lt;AnyAction&gt;((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    // Subscribe to redux store\n    const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() =&gt; {\n      const state = store.getState();\n      const currentPage = state.router.location.pathname;\n      const lastAction = state.lastAction;\n      if (currentPage !== pageToAwaitActionOn) {\n        // user navigated away -unsubscribe and reject\n        unsubscribe();\n        reject(‘User navigated away’);\n      } else if (lastAction.type === actionType) {\n        // Action types match! Unsubscribe and resolve with action object\n        unsubscribe();\n        resolve(lastAction);\n      }\n    });\n  });</pre></code>\n            <p>The listener reads the current state and grabs the <code>currentPage</code> and <code>lastAction</code> data. If <code>currentPage</code> doesn’t match <code>pageToAwaitActionOn</code>, it means the user navigated away, and there’s no need to continue resolving the deep link - we unsubscribe, and reject the promise. Deep link resolvers are stopped, and React Router unblocked.</p><p>Else, if <code>lastAction.type</code> matches the <code>actionType</code> parameter, it means the action we are waiting on just happened! Unsubscribe, and resolve the promise with action metadata. The deep link keeps resolving.</p><p>That’s it! We also added a similar function - <code>waitForAction</code> - which does exactly the same thing, but is not restricted to a specific page.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"scrollanchor-component\">ScrollAnchor component</h3>\n            <a href=\"#scrollanchor-component\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>We implemented a wrapper component ScrollAnchor that will scroll to its wrapped content, making our deep links even more targeted.

But it turns out that there are a few problems that prevent this super simple approach:</p><ul><li><p>The Dashboard’s fixed header</p></li><li><p>DOM updates after page load</p></li></ul><p>Since the Dashboard contains a fixed header at the top of the page, we can’t simply anchor to any ID, since the content will be scrolled to the top of the browser window <i>behind</i> the header. Fortunately, there’s a simple CSS solution using negative margins:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\">&lt;div id=”super-important-setting-card” padding-top={headerOffset} margin-top={headerOffset}&gt;\n  &lt;SuperImportantSettingCard /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre></code>\n            \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5fsQmMLnn9G44KEnxEuhtd/598f79ee26775ac850960bc7d7a797c5/image2-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"735\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This CSS trick alone would work for a static site with a fixed header, but the Dashboard is very dynamic. We found early on in testing that using a normal HTML ID anchor in a URL would cause the browser to jump to the tag <i>on page load</i> but the DOM would change in response to newly fetched information or re-rendering, and the anchored content would be pushed out of view.</p><p>A solution: scroll to the anchored content after the page content is fully loaded, i.e. after all API calls are resolved, spinners removed, content is rendered. Fortunately, there’s a good way to programmatically scroll a browser window: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView\">Element.scrollIntoView()</a>. However, there isn’t a good way to tell <i>when</i> the DOM is finished changing, since it can be modified at any time after page load. Let’s consider two possible strategies for determining when to scroll anchored content into view.</p><p>Strategy #1: scroll after a fixed duration. If our goal is to make sure we only scroll to content after a page is “fully loaded”, we can simplify the problem by making some assumptions. Namely, we can assume a maximum amount of time it will take a given page to fetch resources from the backend and re-render the DOM. Let’s call this assumed max duration <code>M</code> milliseconds. We can then easily scroll to some content by running a timeout on page load:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\">setTimeout(() =&gt; scrollTo(htmlId), M)</pre></code>\n            <p>The problem with this approach is that the DOM might finish updating before or after we scroll. We end up with vertical alignment problems (as the DOM is still settling) or a jarring, unexpected scroll (if we scroll long after the DOM is settled). Both options are bad UX, and in practice it’s difficult to choose a duration constant M that is “just right” for every single page.</p><p>Strategy #2: scroll after the DOM has “settled”. If we know that choosing a good duration <code>M</code> for every page isn’t practical, we should try to come up with an algorithm that can choose a better <code>M</code>:</p><ol><li><p>Define an arbitrary threshold of DOM “busyness”, <code>B</code> milliseconds.</p></li><li><p>On page load, start a timer that will scroll to anchored content after <code>B</code> milliseconds.</p></li><li><p>If we observe any changes to the DOM, reset the timer.</p></li><li><p>Once the timer expires, we know that the DOM hasn’t changed in <code>B</code> milliseconds.</p></li></ol><p>By varying our choice of <code>B</code>, we’re able to have some control over how long we’re willing to wait for a page to “finish loading”. If B is 0 milliseconds, we’ll scroll to the anchored content immediately. If it’s 1000 milliseconds, we’ll wait a full second after any DOM change before scrolling. This algorithm is more resilient than fixed threshold scrolling since it explicitly listens to the DOM, but the chosen threshold is somewhat arbitrary. After some trial and error loading a sample of Dashboard pages, we determined that a 500 millisecond busyness threshold was sufficient to allow all content to load onto a page. Here’s what the implementation looks like:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\">const SETTLE_THRESHOLD = 500;\nconst scrollThunk = (observer: MutationObserver) =&gt; {\n  scrollToAnchor(id);\n  observer.disconnect();\n};\n\nlet domTimer: number;\n\nconst observer = new MutationObserver((_mutationsList, observer) =&gt; {\n  domTimer = resetTimeout(domTimer, scrollTunk, SETTLE_THRESHOLD, observer);\n});\n\nobserver.observe(document.body, {childList: true, subtree: true});\n\ndomTimer = window.setTimeout(scrollThunk, SETTLE_THRESHOLD, observer);</pre></code>\n            <p>A key assumption is that API calls take roughly the same amount of time to resolve. If most fetches take 250ms to resolve but others take 1500ms, we might see that the DOM hasn’t been changed for a while and think that it’s settled. Who knew there would be so much work involved in scrolling!</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n            <a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>There you have it.
