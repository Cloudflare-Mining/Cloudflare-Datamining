	<p>Since CloudFlare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pagerules-fine-grained-feature-co">launched Page Rules in 2012</a>, our Free, Pro and Business users have been asking for a way to get more Page Rules without committing to the next plan up. Starting today, anyone on CloudFlare can <a href="https://cloudflare.com/a/page-rules">add 5 additional Page Rules</a> for just $5/month.</p>
	<p>Page Rules allows you to fine tune your site speed and to apply CloudFlare’s wide range of features to specific parts of your site. Page Rules are also <a href="https://api.cloudflare.com/#page-rules-for-a-zone-properties">accessible over our API</a>, so you can integrate them into your build process or sync them across your domains.</p>
