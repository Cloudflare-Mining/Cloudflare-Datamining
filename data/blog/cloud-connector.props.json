Throughout this process, we were focused on making the setup as intuitive as possible, reducing the need for additional configurations and making it accessible to users of all technical backgrounds.</p><p>At its core, Cloud Connector builds on Cloudflare&#39;s existing Ruleset Engine, the same technology that powers <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/\"><u>Origin Rules</u></a>. Origin Rules typically operate during the <code>http_request_origin</code> <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/\"><u>phase</u></a>, where they manage how requests are routed to different origins. A phase, in Cloudflare&#39;s system, represents a specific stage in the life of a request where rulesets can be executed. Each phase has a dedicated purpose, with rules defined at the account and zone levels to control different aspects of a request’s journey through our network.</p><p>Phases are essential because they allow us to apply actions at precise points in the request flow. For example, the http_request_origin phase focuses on routing, ensuring that traffic is directed to the correct origin based on the rules you set. By defining specific phases, we can optimize performance and enforce security measures at the right time without overlap or conflicts between different actions.</p><p>Rather than creating an entirely new system, we extended the existing <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/create-api/\"><u>&quot;route&quot; action</u></a> within Ruleset Engine to handle a specific set of pre-approved cloud provider endpoints, such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/r2/\"><u>Cloudflare R2</u></a>.</p><p>To maintain the modularity of our system and avoid introducing product-specific abstractions into our core Ruleset Engine control plane, we developed <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/cloud-connector/create-api/\"><u>a thin API translator layer</u></a> on <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/\"><u>Workers</u></a>. This layer acts as an intermediary between the user-facing Cloud Connector API and the underlying Ruleset Engine API.</p><p>When a user <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/zone-cloud-conenctor-rules-put\"><u>creates</u></a> a Cloud Connector rule, it’s translated on the backend into a series of existing Ruleset Engine-based actions. For instance, if a user sets up a rule to route traffic to an AWS S3 bucket, our system translates this into actions that adjust the host header and origin settings to point to the S3 endpoint. This allows a single Cloud Connector rule to be decomposed into multiple rules within a zone’s entry point ruleset.</p><p>These rules are processed in reverse order, adhering to a &quot;last rule wins&quot; approach. This ensures that the final matching rule determines the traffic’s routing, preserving the behavior users expect. For example, if traffic is routed to an AWS S3 bucket, the system will first match the traffic based on the URI, then disable SSL if necessary, and finally route to the S3 origin. Once the appropriate rule is matched, a <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/create-exception/#skip-all-remaining-rules\"><u>&quot;skip&quot; action</u></a> is invoked to prevent any further rules from altering the traffic, which prevents unintended behavior like disabling SSL for traffic routed to a different cloud provider.</p><p>When users <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/zone-cloud-connector-rules\"><u>retrieve</u></a> their Cloud Connector rules, the system reverses this process, reconstructing the original actions from the decomposed rules. This ensures that users see their configurations as they originally defined them, without needing to understand the underlying complexities.</p><p>To support Cloud Connector&#39;s unique requirements, we introduced a new request phase, <code>http_request_cloud_connector</code>. As the final request phase, this ensures that Cloud Connector rules have the last say in traffic routing decisions. This priority prevents conflicts with other routing rules, ensuring that traffic is securely and accurately routed according to the user’s intent.</p><p>Cloudflare is committed to building Cloudflare products on Cloudflare, leveraging existing technologies while innovating to meet new challenges. By building on <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/\"><u>Origin Rules</u></a> and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/\"><u>Workers</u></a>, introducing the <code>http_request_cloud_connector</code> phase, and creating a thin API translation layer, we’ve developed a solution that simplifies multi-cloud routing without compromising on performance or security.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"whats-next-for-cloud-connector\">What’s next for Cloud Connector?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#whats-next-for-cloud-connector\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The current version of Cloud Connector is just the beginning.
