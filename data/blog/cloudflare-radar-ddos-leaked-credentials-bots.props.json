To that end, during 2023’s Security Week, we <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-url-scanner-early-access/\"><u>launched our URL Scanner</u></a>, which enables users to safely scan any URL to determine if it is safe to view or interact with. During 2024’s Security Week, we <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/email-security-insights-on-cloudflare-radar/\"><u>launched an Email Security page</u></a>, which provides a unique perspective on the threats posed by malicious emails, spam volume, the adoption of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/\"><u>email authentication methods like SPF, DMARC, and DKIM</u></a>, and the use of IPv4/IPv6 and TLS by email servers.

Or maybe you get an email from an identity monitoring service that your username and password were found on the “dark web”. (Of course, you’re getting those alerts thanks to a complementary subscription to the service offered as penance from another data breach…)</p><p>This credential theft is especially problematic because people often reuse passwords, despite best practices advising the use of strong, unique passwords for each site or application. To help mitigate this risk, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-safer-internet-with-cloudflare/#account-takeover-detection\"><u>starting in 2024</u></a>, Cloudflare began enabling customers to scan authentication requests for their websites and applications using a <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-preserving-compromised-credential-checking/\"><u>privacy-preserving</u></a> compromised credential checker implementation to detect known-leaked usernames and passwords. Today, we&#39;re using aggregated data to display trends in how often these leaked and stolen credentials are observed across Cloudflare&#39;s network. (Here, we are defining “leaked credentials” as usernames or passwords being found in a public dataset, or the username and password detected as being similar.)</p><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/#how-it-works\"><u>Leaked credentials detection</u></a> scans incoming HTTP requests for known authentication patterns from common web apps and any custom detection locations that were configured. The service uses a privacy-preserving compromised credential checking protocol to compare a hash of the detected passwords to hashes of compromised passwords found in databases of leaked credentials. A <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer#leaked-credentials-usage\"><u>new Radar graph</u></a> on the worldwide <b>Application Layer</b> Security page provides visibility into aggregate trends around the detection of leaked credentials in authentication requests. Filterable by authentication requests from human users, bots, or all (human + bot), the graph shows the distribution requests classified as “clean” (no leaked credentials detected) and “compromised” (leaked credentials, as defined above, were used). At a worldwide level, we found that for the first week of March 2025, leaked credentials were used in 64% of all, over 65% of bot, and over 44% of human authorization requests. </p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5r8sHbOTrQ1ceGpLa0d3Dn/4ea9ab5b342cd394bd096349d4907ab0/image6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1834\" height=\"762\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>This suggests that from a human perspective, password reuse is still a problem, as is users not taking immediate actions to change passwords when notified of a breach. And from a bot perspective, this suggests that attackers know that there is a good chance that leaked credentials for one website or application will enable them to access that same user’s account elsewhere.</p><p>As a complement to the leaked credentials data, Radar is also now providing a worldwide view into the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer#bot-vs-human\"><u>share of authentication requests originating from bots</u></a>. Note that not all of these requests are necessarily malicious — while some may be associated with <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-credential-stuffing/\">credential stuffing-style attacks</a>, others may be from automated scripts or other benign applications accessing an authentication endpoint. (Having said that, automated malicious attack request volume far exceeds legitimate automated login attempts.) During the first week of March 2025, we found that over 94% of authentication requests came from bots (were automated), with the balance coming from humans. Over that same period, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic?dateStart=2025-03-01&dateEnd=2025-03-07#bot-vs-human\"><u>bot traffic only accounted for 30% of overall requests</u></a>. So although bots don’t represent a majority of request traffic, authentication requests appear to comprise a significant portion of their activity.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/20tYE9sH7SOnJDsnh28ZYz/3c33320a0a7406a348c4b92d22f469ed/image4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1834\" height=\"762\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"bots-get-a-dedicated-page\">Bots get a dedicated page</h3>\n            <a href=\"#bots-get-a-dedicated-page\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As a reminder, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/\"><u>bot</u></a> traffic describes any non-human Internet traffic, and monitoring bot levels can help spot potential malicious activities.

While these views are useful at an individual customer level, aggregated views at a worldwide, location, and network level provide a macro-level perspective on trends and activity. These aggregated views available on Cloudflare Radar not only help customers understand how their observations compare to the larger whole, but they also help the industry understand emerging threats that may require action.</p><p>The underlying data for the graphs and data discussed above is available via the Radar API (<a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/attacks/subresources/layer7/\"><u>Application Layer</u></a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/attacks/subresources/layer3/\"><u>Network Layer</u></a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/http/\"><u>Bots</u></a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/leaked_credentials/\"><u>Leaked Credentials</u></a>). The data can also be interactively explored in more detail across locations, networks, and time periods using Radar’s <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer\"><u>Data Explorer and AI Assistant</u></a>. And as always, Radar and Data Explorer charts and graphs are downloadable for sharing, and embeddable for use in your own blog posts, websites, or dashboards.</p><p>If you share our security, attacks, or bots graphs on social media, be sure to tag us: <a href=\"https://x.com/CloudflareRadar\"><u>@CloudflareRadar</u></a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/1111Resolver\"><u>@1111Resolver</u></a> (X), <a href=\"https://noc.social/@cloudflareradar\"><u>noc.social/@cloudflareradar</u></a> (Mastodon), and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/radar.cloudflare.com\"><u>radar.cloudflare.com</u></a> (Bluesky).
