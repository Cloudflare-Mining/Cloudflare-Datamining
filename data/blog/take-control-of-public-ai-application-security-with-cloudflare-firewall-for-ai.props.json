Think about site search, a chatbot, or a shopping assistant. Regardless of the application type, our goal is to determine whether an application is powered by an LLM behind the scenes.</p><p>One possibility is to look for request path signatures similar to what major LLM providers use. For example, <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create\"><u>OpenAI</u></a>, <a href=\"https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions\"><u>Perplexity</u></a> or <a href=\"https://docs.mistral.ai/api/#tag/chat\"><u>Mistral</u></a> initiate a chat using the <code>/chat/completions</code> API endpoint. Searching through our request logs, we found only a few entries that matched this pattern across our global traffic. This result indicates that we need to consider other approaches to finding <i>any</i> application that is powered by an LLM.</p><p>Another signature to research, popular with LLM platforms, is the use of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events\"><u>server-sent events</u></a>. LLMs need to <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/latency-optimization#don-t-default-to-an-llm\"><u>“think”</u></a>. <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming\"><u>Using server-sent events</u></a> improves the end user’s experience by sending over each <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them\"><u>token</u></a> as soon as it is ready, creating the perception that an LLM is “thinking” like a human being. Matching on requests of server-sent events is straightforward using the response header content type of <code>text/event-stream</code>. This approach expands the coverage further, but does not yet cover the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/02/a-beginners-guide-to-json-the-data-format-for-the-internet/\"><u>majority of applications</u></a> that are using JSON format for data exchanges. Continuing the journey, our next focus is on the responses having header content type of <code>application/json</code>.</p><p>No matter how fast LLMs can be optimized to respond, when chatting with major LLMs, we often perceive them to be slow, as we have to wait for them to “think”. By plotting on how much time it takes for the origin server to respond over identified LLM endpoints (blue line) versus the rest (orange line), we can see in the left graph that origins serving LLM endpoints mostly need more than 1 second to respond, while the majority of the rest takes less than 1 second. Would we also see a clear distinction between origin server response body sizes, where the majority of LLM endpoints would respond with smaller sizes because major LLM providers <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#constrain-user-input-and-limit-output-tokens\"><u>limit output tokens</u></a>? Unfortunately not. The right graph shows that LLM response size largely overlaps with non-LLM traffic.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4CkowlKelGlYueNzSrbsGn/f8091d66a6c0eb8b884c7cc6f2a128ab/1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1220\" height=\"484\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>By dividing origin response size over origin response duration to calculate an effective bitrate, the distinction is even clearer that 80% of LLM endpoints operate slower than 4 KB/s.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5sJKUnLmWwnTWzUOyWVRKO/c98c8fc32dbafa5d79f21effdfc58f34/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Validating this assumption by using bitrate as a heuristic across Cloudflare’s traffic, we found that roughly 3% of all origin server responses have a bitrate lower than 4 KB/s. Are these responses all powered by LLMs? Our gut feeling tells us that it is unlikely that 3% of origin responses are LLM-powered! </p><p>Among the paths found in the 3% of matching responses, there are few patterns that stand out: 1) GraphQL endpoints, 2) device heartbeat or health check, 3) generators (for QR codes, one time passwords, invoices, etc.). Noticing this gave us the idea to filter out endpoints that have a low variance of response size over time — for instance, invoice generation is mostly based on the same template, while conversations in the LLM context have a higher variance.</p><p>A combination of filtering out known false positive patterns and low variance in response size gives us a satisfying result. These matching endpoints, approximately 30,000 of them, labelled <code>cf-llm</code>, can now be found in API Shield or Web assets, depending on your dashboard’s version, for all customers. Now you can review your endpoints and decide how to best protect them.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"detecting-prompts-designed-to-leak-pii\">Detecting prompts designed to leak PII</h3>\n            <a href=\"#detecting-prompts-designed-to-leak-pii\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>There are multiple methods to detect PII in LLM prompts. A common method relies on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions\"><u>regular expressions (“regexes”)</u></a>, which is a method we have been using in the WAF for <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/sensitive-data-detection/\"><u>Sensitive Data Detection</u></a> on the body of the HTTP response from the web server Regexes offer low latency, easy customization, and straightforward implementation. However, regexes alone have limitations when applied to LLM prompts. They require frequent updates to maintain accuracy, and may struggle with more complex or implicit PII, where the information is spread across text rather than a fixed format. </p><p>For example, regexes work well for structured data like credit card numbers and addresses, but struggle with PII is embedded in natural language. For instance, “I just booked a flight using my Chase card, ending in 1111” wouldn’t trigger a regex match as it lacks the expected pattern, even though it reveals a partial credit card number and financial institution.</p><p>To enhance detection, we rely on a <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/named-entity-recognition\"><u>Named Entity Recognition (NER)</u></a> model, which adds a layer of intelligence to complement regex-based detection. NER models analyze text to identify contextual PII data types, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and credit card numbers, making detection more flexible and accurate. Cloudflare’s detection utilizes <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/\"><u>Presidio</u></a>, an open-source PII detection framework, to further strengthen this approach.</p><h4>Using Workers AI to deploy Presidio</h4>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5ruqPkxJBgFCRdsoft1TO1/aa327b069569a0f952c8baea102955b8/3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1121\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>In our design, we leverage Cloudflare <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/\"><u>Workers AI</u></a> as the fastest way to deploy <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/\"><u>Presidio</u></a>. This integration allows us to process LLM app requests inline, ensuring that sensitive data is flagged before it reaches the model.</p><p>Here’s how it works:</p><p>When Firewall for AI is enabled on an application and an end user sends a request to an LLM-powered application, we pass the request to Cloudflare Workers AI which runs the request through Presidio’s NER-based detection model to identify any potential PII from the available <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/supported_entities/\"><u>entities</u></a>. The output includes metadata like “Was PII found?” and “What type of PII entity?”. This output is then processed in our Firewall for AI module, and handed over to other systems, like <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/\"><u>Security Analytics</u></a> for visibility, and the rules like <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/\"><u>Custom rules</u></a> for enforcement. Custom rules allow customers to take appropriate actions on the requests based on the provided metadata. </p><p>If no terminating action, like blocking, is triggered, the request proceeds to the LLM.

The next feature we’ll release is token counting, which analyzes prompt structure and length. Customers can use the token count field in Rate Limiting and WAF Custom rules to prevent their users from sending very long prompts, which can impact third party model bills, or allow users to abuse the models. This will be followed by using AI to detect and allow content moderation, which will provide more flexibility in building guardrails in the rules.</p><p>If you&#39;re an enterprise customer, join the Firewall for AI beta today! Contact your customer team to start monitoring traffic, building protection rules, and taking control of your LLM traffic.</p>",
