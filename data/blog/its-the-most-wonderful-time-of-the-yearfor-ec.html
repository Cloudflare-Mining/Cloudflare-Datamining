	<p>We've had to evolve beyond merely "selling online." It's no longersufficient to put up a page clamoring "Here are 12 a mazing vacations this week." We've seen travelers increasingly seeking inspiration and guidance. Finding the right vacation is a personalized and, at times, challenging process as many variables need to be juggled. While we've dramatically improved search and categorization on our site, we're just getting started. Solving these problems is less about using a specific search technology like Lucene, SphinX, SLI Systems, or Endeca and more about information architecture and accommodating a critical factor: Human curation. Everything you see on our site is an ever-evolving blend of human and machine curation. While search engines will seek out what you want, we have the added responsibility of helping visitors shape their traveling desires.</p>

	<p>These core fundamentals really matter: performance, SEO, business intelligence, merchandising, and seasonal relevance.</p>
	<p>For site performance, one of the tools we use is CloudFlare. To audit and monitor site speed, we use a blend of inexpensive resources such as <a href="https://webpagetest.org">webpagetest.org</a>,<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>, and <a href="http://www.nimsoft.com/solutions/nimsoft-cloud-user-experience.html/.html%20">WatchMouse</a>(now Nimsoft Cloud Monitor). <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/169123628">I'll defer to your local expert to cover SEO</a>.</p>
	<p>We leverage Google Analytics and in-house-built event frameworks and data warehousing for various aspects of business intelligence. I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com">Tableau Software</a> to crunch data.For any site, and especially commerce sites, analyzing your marketing channels and respective conversion rates can uncover valuable insights: A/B testing is a very important part of this process. We've found <a href="http://www.phpscenario.org">PHP Scenario</a> very helpful and we've integrated it into our A/B testing platform.</p>
	<p>You might also consider giving your customers a voice by launching a community around your brand. While we've had a community on our site for some time, participation in it had died down. In 2012 we completely revamped it into "<a href="http://www.luxurylink.com/community/blogs">The Luxury Lounge</a>" -- This initiative has brought about renewed interest from our loyal members in sharing their travel experiences. It's a veritable trove of great travel insights. It is positive for SEO, as well.</p>

	<p>Online commerce has had to evolve beyond just listing and selling products, as competition and margins have become fierce. Consumers seek insights and guidance. Commerce sites featuring fresh, relevant and timely content in the form of editorial and consumer insights, tend to do better than sites that don't. In recognition of this, Google's algorithm updates have shaken things up. Incumbent sites that once merely listed products are finding themselves displaced by sites offering relevant content about those products. SEO is an exciting world where quality content is king, and this has had an impact on every commerce site I've worked on.</p>

	<p>Our server origin is in downtown Los Angeles. We have seen a big speed difference in the average time it takes to download a dynamic web page weighing 23,000 bytes from Texas:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">Without CloudFlare: 569 milliseconds
With CloudFlare: 332 milliseconds</code></pre>
	<p>This is for dynamic content. In other words, for this type of request, CloudFlare has to fetch the dynamic content from our system, and then pass it along to the user, every time. Going through CloudFlare for dynamic content delivery is 42 percent faster.</p>
	<p>Overall, I believe CloudFlare is the best thing to happen to the Web in recent memory, and by extension, the Internet at large. CloudFlare's infrastructure is staggering and the architecture and pace of innovation are simply impressive. CloudFlare's offerings have an incredibly positive impact on site owners and web visitors.</p>
