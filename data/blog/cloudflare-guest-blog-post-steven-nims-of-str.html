	<p>Hi there! My name is Steve Nims and I'm a recent graduate of Rochester
		Institute of Technology's <a href="http://saunders.rit.edu/" target="_blank">E. Philip Saunders College of
			Business</a> located in Rochester, NY. While I
		received my B.S. from RIT in Accounting, I've always had a passion for
		technology. So after graduating, when two of my fraternity brothers
		asked me if I wanted to help with their start-up that builds and hosts
		websites for small and medium sized businesses/NPOs, I jumped at the
		opportunity.<img alt="" src="http://www.stephenjnims.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" title="More..."><noscript><img alt="" src="http://www.stephenjnims.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" title="More..."></noscript></p>
	<p>The best part of our service is we're helping our clients save money by
		using free and open source solutions like
		<a href="https://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla!</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>
		to run their websites. We also cut costs by outsourcing design work to
		pre-made templating firms like <a href="http://yootheme.com/" target="_blank">YOOtheme</a> and
		<a href="http://www.rockettheme.com/" target="_blank">RocketTheme</a> when we're not creating our
		own designs using <a href="http://www.artisteer.com/" target="_blank">Artisteer</a>...none of us
		are graphic designers by any stretch of imagination!
	</p>
	<p>As the resident techie with our start-up, I'm responsible for everything
		to do with our server including all-things security and performance
		related. Before CloudFlare, this required me to be constantly monitoring
		server logs, adding suspected bad IP addresses to our firewall, and
		tuning the PHP bytecode cacher xcache on a constant basis, taking my
		attention away from delivering a truly unique customer experience to our
		clients.</p>
	<p>I was invited to use <a href="https://cloudflare.com" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a> earlier this
		year as a beta tester for my donating a MX entry to <a href="https://projecthoneypot.org/" target="_blank">Project Honey
			Pot</a> and installing a honey pot of my own
		to help collect bad IP addresses. I'm kind of embarrassed to say, but I
		was using Project Honey Pot to find the suspected bad IP addresses I was
		adding to our server's firewall, searching on one IP address at a time
		from our server's logs..not exactly the most efficient! That's why when
		I received the invite to CloudFlare and read what features the service
		provided, especially in my case the blocking of bad internet traffic, I
		was very excited!</p>
	<p>Since adding all of our websites to CloudFlare back in August, close to
		9,000 bad requests have been blocked from over 1600 unique threats. In
		addition, CloudFlare has accelerated our client's websites considerably:
		<strong><em>10.3DAYS</em></strong> of visitor's browsing time has been <strong><em>SAVED</em></strong>, <strong><em>29.9
				GB</em></strong> worth of bandwidth was <strong><em>NOT USED</em></strong> because of CloudFlare, and
		the average page load time has <strong>DROPPED</strong> from <strong><em>2.03</em></strong> seconds to
		<strong><em>1.2</em></strong> seconds, meaning our websites load about <strong><em>40% FASTER</em></strong> with
		CloudFlare! Did I mention we get all of this using CloudFlare's
		<strong><em>FREE</em></strong> service?!?!
	</p>
	<p>That said, to help protect our clients from unwelcome visitors, <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22050782-Will-CloudFlare-hurt-my-SEO-" target="_blank">speed
			up their
			websites</a>,
		and allow us to focus more on the service we provide to them, we now
		enable CloudFlare for <strong><em>ALL</em></strong> of our sites that we host - by my count,
		that's <strong><em>22 websites!</em></strong> It was really easy to get our client's
		websites running through CloudFlare. There isn't any software to
		install, no messy configuration files to play with - no fuss! All I had
		to do was change the DNS entries for our client's domain names so they
		pointed to CloudFlare's DNS servers and wait for the changes to
		propagate throughout the web. The only hard work was compiling the
		Apache server module
		<a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/forums/21318827-How-do-I-restore-original-visitor-IP-to-my-server-logs-" target="_blank">mod_cloudflare</a> so our
		server's logs report the correct IP address of visiting users instead of
		CloudFlare's proxy IP. However, I've done the hard work for you...read
		the 5 easy steps I've posted to my blog
		<a href="http://www.stephenjnims.com/2010/10/27/use-mod_cloudflare-on-your-ubuntu-10-04-lts-lamp-server/?utm_source=cloudflare_blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_content=mod_cloudflare_post&amp;utm_campaign=guest_blog" target="_blank">here</a>
		for a walk-through on how to download, compile and enable the module on
		your own server. Using mod_cloudflare isn't required, but any systems
		admin worth their weight will want to enable it.
	</p>
	<p>Beyond making the part of my job where I'm managing the security and
		optimization of our server super easy, my favorite feature of CloudFlare
		is the development mode. I'm known to tinker with a new CMS package that
		I've read about on the web, or play around with variations on our
		current websites' designs for the fun of it, or sometimes load a demo
		just to see if a particular new idea works for a client. So I want to be
		able to see any updates or work I've done immediately! The development
		mode temporarily disables CloudFlare's accelerated cache for 3 hours,
		allowing you to see changes in cachable content like CSS, JavaScript or
		images as you change them. I don't have to tinker with page headers to
		tell CloudFlare not to cache certain content or set it's expiration time
		either. Also, without any intervention on my part, after the 3 hours are
		up, CloudFlare automatically reverts back to caching static content.</p>
	<p>If you're new to CloudFlare, I hope you enjoy the service as much as I
		have! If you plan on running any sort of e-commerce website, or need an
		extra layer of security for your own purposes, check out the
		<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans.html" target="_blank">Pro</a> service plan (only
		$20/month for your first website, $5/month thereafter) which enables
		you to easily add
		<a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22077247-How-do-I-add-SSL-to-my-site-" target="_blank">SSL</a>
		security to your website for only $1/month per site. With the Pro plan
		you also get advanced security protection, even <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22263581-What-does-the-Website-Preloader-do-" target="_blank">faster page
			loads</a>, and virtually real
		time statistics!
