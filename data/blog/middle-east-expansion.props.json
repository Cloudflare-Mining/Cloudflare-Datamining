And as we march past number 40, we’re proud to announce yet another. Introducing CloudFlare’s latest points of presence (PoPs) in Doha, Qatar; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Kuwait City, Kuwait; and Muscat, Oman. These data centers are the first wave in our MENA (Middle East/North Africa) expansion, and the 39th, 40th, 41st and 42nd data centers, respectively, to join our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network-map\">global network</a>.</p><p>Up to this point all CloudFlare traffic delivered to the MENA region was served from our <a href=\"/groovy-baby-cloudflares-london-data-center-no/\">London</a>, <a href=\"/frankfurt-data-center-makes-11/\">Frankfurt</a>, <a href=\"/marseille/\">Marseille</a>, <a href=\"/ohh-la-la-cloudflare-paris-data-center-goes-l/\">Paris</a> and/or <a href=\"/cloudflares-singapore-data-center-now-online/\">Singapore</a> data centers, with round trip latency of up to 200-350ms. As in Africa, local bandwidth in MENA is notoriously expensive making it cost prohibitive to deliver content locally. That is (once again), until now! We&#39;re proud to announce the first of a series of agreements with regional carriers including <a href=\"http://www.etisalat.ae/\">Etisalat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.omantel.om/\">Omantel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ooredoo.com/\">Ooredoo</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.zain.com\">Zain</a> to help build a better Internet in the region.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3aOuLDDYnRsGVJPa0d8gUd/c51cad276aa25dd06d215aefbead9210/MENA-Partners-Logo.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"648\" height=\"160\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-to-build-a-better-internet\">How to build a better Internet</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-to-build-a-better-internet\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>A few of the necessary ingredients to build a better Internet include international connectivity (often in the form of submarine cable systems) that connect to national backbones which, in turn, deliver the Internet to the access networks that bridge the last mile to Internet users themselves—all of which must be in place and optimally utilized to meet increasing demand in the most cost effective way. Fortunately, in the MENA region, there is already good international connectivity, with the vast majority of Internet traffic transferred internationally through submarine cables (something we referenced in our <a href=\"/marseille/\">Marseille</a> blog post), and substantial investments already made into national backbones and last mile infrastructure (e.g. broadband and mobile networks) to the end user.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/38khC86cv884rRQFpXo2X/54654494dd624c593469aa9769ea8ce3/MENA-Submarine-Cable-Map.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"524\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>All MENA countries are connected with at least two submarine cables; the UAE alone has 15+!</i></p><p>The problem is that the international submarine cables built in the region were designed to link individual countries in MENA with Europe and Asia, and <i>not</i> to provide regional connectivity <i>within</i> MENA. The number of undersea cables that pass through the region without interconnection is staggering. Consequently, there is patchy submarine connectivity between the Middle Eastern parts and the North African parts of MENA (with Egypt playing a pivotal role). What this means for CloudFlare (and you) is that it takes a lot of individual PoPs to achieve broad, local coverage of broadband and mobile users in the region. It is for this reason that we’ve announced a record setting four new PoPs deployed in a single month, with even more on the way.</p><p>An additional complexity is that, even with all of the right infrastructure related ingredients, the majority of Internet content accessed in MENA is hosted far far away in North America, Europe and Asia. That is, of course, unless you are a CloudFlare user. As of now, the collective content of all 2 million+ CloudFlare users is <i>locally</i> accessible through the networks of our partners in the region. No additional configuration required. This re-routing of traffic is now automatically in effect for all CloudFlare users worldwide.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"its-not-a-mirage\">It&#39;s not a mirage</h3>\n            <a href=\"#its-not-a-mirage\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As the latency measurements below demonstrate, our data centers across the Middle East are already delivering significant performance improvement.
