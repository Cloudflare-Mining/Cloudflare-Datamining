Its number of <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/casb-integrations/\"><u>supported integrations</u></a>, its ease of setup, and speed in identifying critical issues across popular SaaS platforms, like files shared publicly in Microsoft 365 and exposed sensitive data in Google Workspace, has made it a go-to for many.</p><p>However, as we’ve engaged with customers, one thing became clear: the risks of unmonitored or exposed data at-rest go far beyond just SaaS environments. Sensitive information – whether intellectual property, customer data, or personal identifiers – can wreak havoc on an organization’s reputation and its obligations to its customers if it falls into the wrong hands. For many of our customers, the security of data stored in cloud providers like AWS and GCP is even more critical than the security of data in their SaaS tools.</p><p>That’s why we’ve extended Cloudflare CASB to include <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/\"><u>Cloud DLP (Data Loss Prevention)</u></a> functionality, enabling users to scan objects in Amazon S3 buckets and Google Cloud Storage for sensitive data matches​.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5TKXiAkQKxw3GFQBCuQLjX/198e4620da8239280eff669b7b62678b/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1036\" height=\"704\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>With <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/dlp/\"><u>Cloudflare DLP</u></a>, you can choose from pre-built detection profiles that look for common data types (such as Social Security Numbers or credit card numbers) or create your own custom profiles using regular expressions​. As soon as an object matching a DLP profile is detected, you can dive into the details, understanding the file’s context, seeing who owns it, and more. These capabilities provide the insight needed to quickly protect data and prevent exposure in real time.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4cyOaQJ0ZyPO8r7LyeU6ON/30b8453888d6cb13dcb15225f875a0cd/3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1224\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>And as with all CASB integrations, this new functionality also comes with posture management features, meaning whether you’re using AWS or GCP, we’ll help you identify misconfigurations and other cloud security issues that could leave your data vulnerable​, like buckets that are publicly-accessible or have critical logging settings disabled, access keys needing rotation, or users without <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/\"><u>multi-factor authentication (MFA)</u></a>.

Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li><p><b>Compute Account</b>: The entire process runs within a cloud account owned by your organization, known as a Compute Account. This design ensures your data remains within your boundaries, avoiding costly cloud egress fees. The Compute Account can be launched in under 15 minutes using a provided Terraform template.</p></li><li><p><b>Controller function</b>: Every minute, a lightweight, serverless controller function in your cloud environment communicates with Cloudflare’s APIs, fetching the latest DLP configurations and security profiles from your Cloudflare One account.</p></li><li><p><b>Crawler process</b>: The controller triggers an object discovery task, which is processed by a second serverless function known as the Crawler. The Crawler queries cloud storage accounts, like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage, via API to identify new objects. Redis is used within the Compute Account to track which objects have yet to be evaluated.</p></li><li><p><b>Scanning for sensitive data</b>: Newly discovered objects are sent through a queue to a third serverless function called the Scanner. This function downloads the objects and streams their contents to the DLP engine in the Compute Account, which scans for matches against predefined or custom DLP Profiles.</p></li><li><p><b>Finding generation and alerts</b>: If a DLP match is found, metadata about the object, such as context and ownership details, is published to a queue. This data is ingested by a Cloudflare-hosted service and presented in the Cloudflare Dashboard as findings, giving security teams the visibility needed to take swift action.</p></li></ul><h4>Scalable and secure design</h4><p>The DLP pipeline ensures that sensitive data never leaves your cloud environment — a privacy-first approach. All communication between the Compute Account and Cloudflare&#39;s APIs are initiated by the controller, also meaning there is no need to perform any extra configuration to allow ingress traffic.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-to-get-started\">How to get started</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-to-get-started\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>To get started, reach out to your account team to learn more about this new data security functionality and our roadmap.
