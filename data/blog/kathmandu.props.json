Most of us learn that at school; however there’s plenty of other mountains located in Nepal. Here’s the ones above 8,000 meters (extracted from the full <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_in_Nepal\">list</a>) to get you started:</p><ul><li><p>Mount Everest at 8,848 meters</p></li><li><p>Kanchenjunga at 8,586 meters</p></li><li><p>Lhotse at 8,516 meters</p></li><li><p>Makalu at 8,463 meters</p></li><li><p>Cho Oyu at 8,201 meters</p></li><li><p>Dhaulagiri I at 8,167 meters</p></li><li><p>Manaslu at 8,156 meters</p></li><li><p>Annapurna I at 8,091 meters</p></li></ul>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/y3qaG3RlrZASkNn3ZgIyn/88a0491b1d264693488cec2f746b2c45/Annapurna-1.jpg\" alt=\"Annapurna\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2056\" height=\"1156\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Photo of Annapurna taken outside Pokhara by blog author</p><p>As we said, Kathmandu and Nepal are very mountainous region! Some of these mountains are shared with neighboring countries. In-fact, the whole Himalayan range stretches much further than just Nepal as it also encompasses neighboring countries such as Bhutan, China, India, and Pakistan.</p><h3>Nepal’s flag</h3><p>The official flag of Nepal is not a rectangle, it’s a very unique shape. No other flag comes close to having this shape. At first viewing it looks simple, just two triangles (representing the Himalayas) placed vertically against the flagpole. Nope - the triangles have a very specific dimension.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2V08miylR35evbJmrUQTgs/a7a32e0bf87c681cbef234713a142339/Flag_of_Nepal.svg\" alt=\"Flag_of_Nepal\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"726\" height=\"885\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The flags symbolism goes beyond the mountains. The two white symbols represent the calming moon and fierce sun or sometimes the cool weather in the Himalayas and warm lowlands.</p><p>But back to those two triangles. Ignoring the old adage (&quot;It was my understanding that there would be no <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Chevy_Chase\">math</a>.&quot;), let’s grab what Wikipedia says about the shape of this flag and see if we can follow along.</p><p>First off, let’s explain irrational vs rational numbers (or ratios or fractions). A rational number is a simple P/Q number like 1/2 or 3/4 or 1/5 or even 16/9 etc etc. The numerator and denominator must both be integers. Even 100003/999983 (using prime numbers) is a rational number. If the denominator is 0 then the number isn’t rational.</p><p>An irrational number is everything else. If it can’t be written as P/Q, then it’s irrational. This means a number that doesn’t terminate or doesn’t become periodic. For example, π or Pi (3.141592653589793238462…), e or Euler&#39;s Number (2.718281828459045235360…), the square root of 2 (1.414213562373095…), etc. These are all irrational numbers. Don’t be fooled by 4/3. While it’s impossible to full write out (1.33333… continuing forever), yet it’s actually a rational number.</p><p>(Read up about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippasus\">Hippasus</a>, who’s credited with discovering the existence of irrational numbers, if you want an irrational <a href=\"https://esoterx.com/2014/12/03/murder-by-math-the-irrational-demise-of-hippasus/\">murder story</a>!)</p><p>That’s enough math theory; now back to the Nepali flag. Each red triangle has a rational ratio. The flag is started with simple 1:1 and 3:4 ratios and that’s the easy part. We are all capable of grabbing paper or cloth and make a rectangle that’s 3 inches by 4 inches, or 1.5 meters by 2 meters or any 3:4 ratio. It’s simple math. What gets complicated is adding the blue border. For that, we need to read-up what was said by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS Foundation) and Wikipedia. They both go into <a href=\"https://oeis.org/A230582\">great depth</a> to describe the full mathematical dimensions of the flag. Let’s just paraphrase them slightly:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/uqQQ9I3fG4JYIRNEYDTZ7/95bc46d91fa112cb9b254c926742e22e/nepal-flag-formula.png\" alt=\"nepal-flag-formula\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2140\" height=\"292\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>However the math (and geometry) award goes to the work done in order to produce &quot;Calculation of the aspect ratio of the national flag of Nepal&quot;. The final geometric drawing is this:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/779S5lpYn9k8E1QGWBVJf/4ec2d7e46464b6e60223a7e7fa4fd30b/nepal-flag-geometry.png\" alt=\"nepal-flag-geometry\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"438\" height=\"514\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"https://0xc.de/flags/nepal/\">Berechnung des Seitenverhältnisses der Nationalfahne von Nepal</a></p><p>Yeah - that’s going a bit too far for a Cloudflare blog! Let’s just say that Nepal’s flag is unique and quite interesting.</p><h3>APRICOT 2018</h3><p>We are especially excited to announce our Kathmandu data center while attending <a href=\"https://2018.apricot.net/\">APRICOT</a> conference, being held in Nepal this year. The event, supported by <a href=\"https://conference.apnic.net/45/\">APNIC</a>, the local Regional Internet address Registry (RIR) for the Asia-Pacific region, attracts leaders from Internet industry technical, operational, and policy-making communities. Cloudflare&#39;s favorite part of APRICOT is the Peering Forum track on Monday.</p><h3>SAARC</h3><p>Nepal is just one of eight countries making up the <a href=\"http://www.saarc-sec.org/\">SAARC</a> (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) organization. Headquartered in Kathmandu, it comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p><p>Cloudflare has already deployed into neighboring <a href=\"/cloudflare-launches-in-india-with-data-centers-in-mumbai-chennai-and-new-delhi/\">India</a>, and any astute reader of these blogs will know we are always working on adding sites where and when we can. The SAARC countries are in our focus.</p><h3>Build, build, build!</h3><p>For Cloudflare‘s next two data centers, we head to a different continent and way-south of the equator. Throughout 2018, we’ll announce a stream of deployments across many different cities that each improve the security and performance of millions of our customers.</p><p>If you’re motivated by the idea of helping build one of the world&#39;s largest networks, come <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/\">join our team</a>!</p>",
