		"html": "<p>As is common for many people these days, I write a blog: <a href=\"http://www.onefortywines.com\">OneFortyWines.com</a>. Yay for me, right? I do this because I am passionate about wine, and I <i><b>think</b></i> that people who read the site find it interesting. The problem is that I don&#39;t <b>*know</b> *if they do or not, because I&#39;m not sure who reads the blog (outside of my mom).</p><p>I <i>used</i> to know a lot about my audience, because I had a custom WordPress installation running and was able to install <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\">Google Analytics</a>. Eventually this became too much of a headache for just a hobby, so I migrated over to WordPress.com to host my domain and blog.</p><p>I&#39;m guessing that the majority of people who use WordPress.com for their blogs fall into these same categories:</p><ul><li><p>People who are NOT technically savvy enough to handle hosting and managing their own WordPress installation (and/or)</p></li><li><p>People who simply don&#39;t want to deal with it. This is after all, why WordPress exists, no?</p></li></ul><p>I didn&#39;t realize it at first, but in doing so I no longer had the luxury of Google Analytics on the WordPress.com implementation, as <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/stats/#additional-info\">WordPress doesn&#39;t support this feature</a>. Instead, WordPress offers their own proprietary analytics offering, which seems perfectly fine. However I have multiple sites, including non-WordPress sites, and I would like to have continuity in the analytics and tracking systems I use.</p><p>Equally troubling was the fact that I couldn&#39;t migrate over the reporting history from Google Analytics into WordPress. There may be a feature that supports this, but again, it&#39;s not something the average user is going to do. The chart below will illustrate this issue I&#39;m experiencing, as I moved off of WordPress.com in December 2009 and back on again this month.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5ousKsxoJrrytutf1ys2Fb/de0c0483b59aee73e6c056076d4f3cb3/OneFortyWines_Chart_SM.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"Enabling Google Analytics on Your WordPress.com Blog\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"149\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Thisis where the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/\">CloudFlare Apps</a> feature of our service came in extremely handy. One of the ways that CloudFlare makes sites easier to manage is by enabling popular apps for the domain owner - in this case, it was Google Analytics. Since CloudFlare is optimizing and delivering your site&#39;s content to your visitors, it inserts the Google Analytics JavaScript tracking code in the proper place as your site&#39;s visitors pass through our network. Your site now benefits from both WordPress.com site analytics <i>and</i> Google Analytics.</p><p>Enabling Google Analytics via CloudFlare Apps is a really cool feature that took a total of about 2 minutes for me to setup. There are plenty of other <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/\">cool apps that are available as well</a> - and the best part is that the CloudFlare service and many of the CloudFlare Apps are completely free!</p>",
