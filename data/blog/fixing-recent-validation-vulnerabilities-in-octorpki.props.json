These attacks abuse a set of assumptions that are common across multiple RPKI implementations, and some of these issues were discovered within <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki\">OctoRPKI</a>. More details about the disclosed vulnerabilities can be found in <a href=\"https://labs.ripe.net/author/koen-van-hove/improving-the-resiliency-of-rpki-relying-party-software/\">this RIPE labs article</a> written by one of the researchers. In response, we published a new release of OctoRPKI, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/releases/tag/v1.4.0\">v1.4.0</a>, to address and remediate these vulnerabilities.</p><p>Cloudflare customers do not have to take any action to protect themselves from these newly discovered vulnerabilities, and no Cloudflare customer data was ever at risk.</p><p>We have not seen any attempted exploitation of these vulnerabilities described in the advisory. We use OctoRPKI to perform Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route validation so that our routers know where to direct IP packets at Layer 3 of the TCP/IP stack. TLS provides additional security at the TCP layer to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of customer data going over the Internet in the event of BGP hijacking.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"rpki-and-the-discovered-vulnerabilities\">RPKI and the discovered vulnerabilities</h2>\n      <a href=\"#rpki-and-the-discovered-vulnerabilities\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><a href=\"/rpki/\">Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)</a> is a cryptographic method of signing records that associate a BGP route announcement with the correct originating Autonomous System (AS) number. In order to validate the records that contain that information we use an open source software called <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki\">OctoRPKI</a> that is part of the <a href=\"/cloudflares-rpki-toolkit/\">cfrpki toolkit</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4c7pEjcX37v5tGOWQloxLm/342309b65241350b74045fe31900e24e/image1-2-4.png\" alt=\"OctoRPKI downloads a set of certificates from repositories and distributes them to GoRTR\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1435\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>OctoRPKI and GoRTR ecosystem diagram</i></p><p>OctoRPKI traverses a set of trusted certificate repositories, downloads all the records and manifests that they contain, and performs a set of validation checks on them. If they are valid, OctoRPKI will add their contents into a JSON file that is made available for GoRTR instances to consume.</p><p><a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6481\">RFC6481</a> further defines the role of certificate repositories:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">  To validate attestations made in the context of the Resource Public\n   Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480], relying parties (RPs) need\n   access to all the X.509/PKIX Resource Certificates, Certificate\n   Revocation Lists (CRLs), and signed objects that collectively define\n   the RPKI.\n\n   Each issuer of a certificate, CRL, or a signed object makes it\n   available for download to RPs through the publication of the object\n   in an RPKI repository.\n\n   The repository system is a collection of all signed objects that MUST\n   be globally accessible to all RPs.  When certificates, CRLs and\n   signed objects are created, they are uploaded to a repository\n   publication point, from whence they can be downloaded for use by RPs.</pre></code>\n            <p>The main list of trusted repositories that OctoRPKI uses can be <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/tree/master/cmd/octorpki/tals\">found here</a>. In general, OctoRPKI will attempt to process any file that it downloads from a repository. However, this leaves validation software open to processing malicious input. For example, OctoRPKI could be instructed to download and cache a file which <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/security/advisories/GHSA-cqh2-vc2f-q4fh\">contains a path that performs directory traversal</a>, or it could be provided with a classic <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/security/advisories/GHSA-g9wh-3vrx-r7hg\">GZIP bomb attack</a> leading to a crash. The RFC does not necessarily define limits on content within files returned by a repository and thus, a large number of undefined behaviors can occur.</p><p>Compounding this issue is the fact that any single repository in the chain of trust could introduce undefined behavior. Imagine a scenario where a malicious entity is able to compromise a single repository (there can be hundreds) within a trusted organization, or is able to introduce a malicious Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) file onto the host machine that is running OctoRPKI. In both cases, bad actors can attempt to trigger undefined behavior on machines running OctoRPKI by leveraging the fact that OctoRPKI will attempt to process arbitrary input. Our mitigations were primarily to fail closed whenever these events occurred as there is no other guidance in the RFC.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"undefined-behavior\">Undefined Behavior</h2>\n      <a href=\"#undefined-behavior\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>There were two classes of attacks disclosed in the NSCS advisory that affected OctoRPKI:</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"arbitrary-file-writes\">Arbitrary File Writes</h3>\n      <a href=\"#arbitrary-file-writes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <ul><li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/security/advisories/GHSA-cqh2-vc2f-q4fh\">CVE-2021-3907</a> - Arbitrary filepath traversal via URI injection</p></li></ul><p><b>Impact</b></p><p>OctoRPKI does not escape a URI with a filename containing &quot;..&quot;, which allows a malicious repository to create a file, for example rsync://example.org/repo/../../etc/cron.daily/evil.roa, which would then be written to disk outside the base cache folder.
