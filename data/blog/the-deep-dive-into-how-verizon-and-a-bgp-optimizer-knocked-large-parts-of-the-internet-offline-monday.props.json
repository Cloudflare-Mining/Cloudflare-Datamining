That blog entry came out around 19:58 UTC, just over seven hours after the route leak finished (which will we see below was around 12:39 UTC). Today we will dive into the archived routing data and analyze it. The format of the code below is meant to use simple shell commands so that any reader can follow along and, more importantly, do their own investigations on the routing tables.</p><p>This was a very public BGP route leak event.

It’s not meant to be a real-time service. The data can be queried in many ways, including a full web interface and an API. We are using the API to extract the data in a JSON format.</p><p>We are going to focus only on the Cloudflare routes that were leaked. Many other ASNs were leaked (see the tweet above); however, we want to deal with a finite data set and focus on what happened to Cloudflare’s routing. All the commands below can be run with ease on many systems. Both the scripts and the raw data file are now available on <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/the-deep-dive-into-how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-monda\">GitHub</a>. The following was done on MacBook Pro running macOS Mojave.</p><p>First we collect 24 hours of route announcements and AS-PATH data that RIPEstat sees coming from AS13335 (Cloudflare).</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ # Collect 24 hours of data - more than enough\n$ ASN=&quot;AS13335&quot;\n$ START=&quot;2019-06-24T00:00:00&quot;\n$ END=&quot;2019-06-25T00:00:00&quot;\n$ ARGS=&quot;resource=${ASN}&amp;starttime=${START}&amp;endtime=${END}&quot;\n$ URL=&quot;https://stat.ripe.net/data/bgp-updates/data.json?${ARGS}&quot;\n$ # Fetch the data from RIPEstat\n$ curl -sS &quot;${URL}&quot; | jq . &gt; 13335-routes.json\n$ ls -l 13335-routes.json\n-rw-r--r--  1 martin  staff  339363899 Jun 25 08:47 13335-routes.json\n$</pre></code>\n            <p>That’s 340MB of data - which seems like a lot, but it contains plenty of white space and plenty of data we just don’t need. Our second task is to reduce this raw data down to just the required data - that’s timestamps, actual routes, and AS-PATH. The third item will be very useful. Note we are using <a href=\"https://stedolan.github.io/jq/\">jq</a>, which can be installed on macOS with the  <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">brew package manager</a>.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ # Extract just the times, routes, and AS-PATH\n$ jq -rc &#039;.data.updates[]|.timestamp,.attrs.target_prefix,.attrs.path&#039; &lt; 13335-routes.json | paste - - - &gt; 13335-listing-a.txt\n$ wc -l 13335-listing-a.txt\n691318 13335-listing-a.txt\n$</pre></code>\n            <p>We are down to just below seven hundred thousand routing events, however, that’s not a leak, that’s everything that includes Cloudflare’s ASN (the number 13335 above). For that we need to go back to Monday’s blog and realize it was AS396531 (Allegheny Technologies) that showed up with 701 (Verizon) in the leak. Now we reduce the data further:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ # Extract the route leak 701,396531\n$ # AS701 is Verizon and AS396531 is Allegheny Technologies\n$ egrep &#039;701,396531&#039; &lt; 13335-listing-a.txt &gt; 13335-listing-b.txt\n$ wc -l 13335-listing-b.txt\n204568 13335-listing-b.txt\n$</pre></code>\n            <p>At 204 thousand data points, we are looking better. It’s still a lot of data because BGP can be very chatty if topology is changing. A route leak will cause exactly that. Now let’s see how many routes were affected:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ # Extract the actual routes affected by the route leak\n$ cut -f2 &lt; 13335-listing-b.txt | sort -V -u &gt; 13335-listing-c.txt\n$ wc -l 13335-listing-c.txt\n101 13335-listing-c.txt\n$</pre></code>\n            <p>It’s a much smaller number. We now have a listing of at least 101 routes that were leaked via Verizon. This may not be the full list because route collectors like RIPEstat don’t have direct feeds from Verizon, so this data is a blended view with Verizon’s path and other paths. We can see that if we look at the AS-PATH in the above files. Please note that I had a typo in this script when this blog was first published and only 20 routes showed up because the -n vs -V option was used on sort. Now the list is correct with 101 affected routes. Please see this short article from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42526860/bash-sort-nu-results-in-unexpected-behaviour\">stackoverflow</a> to see the issue.</p><p>Here’s a partial listing of affected routes.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cat 13335-listing-c.txt\n8.39.214.0/24\n8.42.245.0/24\n8.44.58.0/24\n...\n104.16.80.0/21\n104.17.168.0/21\n104.18.32.0/21\n104.19.168.0/21\n104.20.64.0/21\n104.22.8.0/21\n104.23.128.0/21\n104.24.112.0/21\n104.25.144.0/21\n104.26.0.0/21\n104.27.160.0/21\n104.28.16.0/21\n104.31.0.0/21\n141.101.120.0/23\n162.159.224.0/21\n172.68.60.0/22\n172.69.116.0/22\n...\n$</pre></code>\n            <p>This is an interesting list, as some of these routes do not originate from Cloudflare’s network, however, they show up with AS13335 (our ASN) as the originator. For example, the 104.26.0.0/21 route is not announced from our network, but we do announce 104.26.0.0/20 (which covers that route). More importantly, we have an IRR (Internet Routing Registries) route object plus an RPKI ROA for that block. Here’s the IRR object:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">route:          104.26.0.0/20\norigin:         AS13335\nsource:         ARIN</pre></code>\n            <p>And here’s the RPKI ROA. This ROA has Max Length set to 20, so no smaller route should be accepted.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">Prefix:       104.26.0.0/20\nMax Length:   /20\nASN:          13335\nTrust Anchor: ARIN\nValidity:     Thu, 02 Aug 2018 04:00:00 GMT - Sat, 31 Jul 2027 04:00:00 GMT\nEmitted:      Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:45:37 GMT\nName:         535ad55d-dd30-40f9-8434-c17fc413aa99\nKey:          4a75b5de16143adbeaa987d6d91e0519106d086e\nParent Key:   a6e7a6b44019cf4e388766d940677599d0c492dc\nPath:         rsync://rpki.arin.net/repository/arin-rpki-ta/5e4a23ea-...</pre></code>\n            <p>The Max Length field in an ROA says what the minimum size of an acceptable announcement is. The fact that this is a /20 route with a /20 Max Length says that a /21 (or /22 or /23 or /24) within this IP space isn’t allowed. Looking further at the route list above we get the following listing:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">Route Seen            Cloudflare IRR &amp; ROA    ROA Max Length\n104.16.80.0/21    -&gt;  104.16.80.0/20          /20\n104.17.168.0/21   -&gt;  104.17.160.0/20         /20\n104.18.32.0/21    -&gt;  104.18.32.0/20          /20\n104.19.168.0/21   -&gt;  104.19.160.0/20         /20\n104.20.64.0/21    -&gt;  104.20.64.0/20          /20\n104.22.8.0/21     -&gt;  104.22.0.0/20           /20\n104.23.128.0/21   -&gt;  104.23.128.0/20         /20\n104.24.112.0/21   -&gt;  104.24.112.0/20         /20\n104.25.144.0/21   -&gt;  104.25.144.0/20         /20\n104.26.0.0/21     -&gt;  104.26.0.0/20           /20\n104.27.160.0/21   -&gt;  104.27.160.0/20         /20\n104.28.16.0/21    -&gt;  104.28.16.0/20          /20\n104.31.0.0/21     -&gt;  104.31.0.0/20           /20</pre></code>\n            <p>So how did all these /21’s show up? That’s where we dive into the world of BGP route optimization systems and their propensity to synthesize routes that should not exist. If those routes leak (and it’s very clear after this week that they can), all hell breaks loose. That can be compounded when not one, but two ISPs allow invalid routes to be propagated outside their autonomous network. We will explore the AS-PATH further down this blog.</p><p>More than 20 years ago, <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1997\">RFC1997</a> added the concept of <i>communities</i> to BGP. Communities are a way of tagging or grouping route advertisements. Communities are often used to label routes so that specific handling policies can be applied. RFC1997 includes a small number of universal <i>well-known communities</i>.

It’s very consistent. Reading from the back of the line to the front, we have 13335 (Cloudflare), 3356 or 174 (Level3/CenturyLink or Cogent - both tier 1 transit providers for Cloudflare). So far, so good. Then we have 33154 (DQE Communications) and 396531 (Allegheny Technologies Inc) which is still technically not a leak, but trending that way. The reason why we can state this is still technically not a leak is because we don’t know the relationship between those two ASs. It’s possible they have a mutual transit agreement between them. That’s up to them.</p><p>Back to the AS-PATH’s. Still reading leftwards, we see 701 (Verizon), which is very very bad and clear evidence of a leak. It’s a leak for two reasons. First, this matches the path when a transit is leaking a non-customer route from a customer. This Verizon customer does not have 13335 (Cloudflare) listed as a customer. Second, the route contains within its path a tier 1 ASN. This is the point where a route leak should have been absolutely squashed by filtering on the customer BGP session. Beyond this point there be dragons.</p><p>And dragons there be! Everything above is about how Verizon filtered (or didn’t filter) its customer. What follows the 701 (i.e the number to the left of it) is the peers or customers of Verizon that have accepted these leaked routes. They are mainly other tier 1 networks of Verizon in this list: 174 (Cogent), 1239 (Sprint), 1273 (Vodafone), 3320 (DTAG), 3491 (PCCW), 6461 (Zayo), 6762 (Telecom Italia), etc.</p><p>What’s missing from that list are three networks worthy of mentioning - 1299 (Telia), 2914 (NTT), and 7018 (AT&amp;T). All three implement a very simple AS-PATH filter which saved the day for their network. They do not allow one tier 1 ISP to send them a route which has another tier 1 further down the path. That’s because when that happens, it’s officially a leak as each tier 1 is fully connected to all other tier 1’s (which is part of the definition of a tier 1 network). The topology of the Internet’s global BGP routing tables simply states that if you see another tier 1 in the path, then it’s a bad route and it should be filtered away.</p><p>Additionally we know that 7018 (AT&amp;T) operates a network which drops RPKI invalids. Because Cloudflare routes are <a href=\"/rpki-details/\">RPKI signed</a>, this also means that AT&amp;T would have dropped these routes when it receives them from Verizon. This shows a clear win for RPKI (and for AT&amp;T when you see their bandwidth graph below)!</p><blockquote><p>BREAKING - AT&amp;T / AS 7018 is now rejecting RPKI Invalid BGP announcements they receive from their peering partners. This is big news for routing security! If AT&amp;T can do it - you can do it! :-) <a href=\"https://t.co/FhjmWByagO\">https://t.co/FhjmWByagO</a></p><p>— Job Snijders (@JobSnijders) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JobSnijders/status/1094976832267522048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 11, 2019</a></p></blockquote><p>That all said, keep in mind we are still talking about routes that Cloudflare didn&#39;t announce.

Why?</p><p>It turns out that 396531 (Allegheny Technologies Inc) is a network without IPv6 enabled. Normally you would hear Cloudflare chastise anyone that’s yet to enable IPv6, however, in this case we are quite happy that one of the two protocol families survived. IPv6 was stable during this route leak, which now can be called an IPv4-only route leak.</p><p>Yet that’s not really the whole story. Let’s look at the percentage of traffic Cloudflare sends Verizon that’s IPv6 (vs IPv4). Normally the IPv4/IPv6 percentage holds steady.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/63WaYJLNsBep3X6n5GRQ1n/b7313a44aaccbef988957564659ad44e/verizon-ipv6-percentage.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"397\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This uptick in IPv6 traffic could be the direct result of Happy Eyeballs on mobile handsets picking a working IPv6 path into Cloudflare vs a non-working IPv4 path. Happy Eyeballs is meant to protect against IPv6 failure, however in this case it’s doing a wonderful job in protecting from an IPv4 failure. Yet we have to be careful with this graph because after further thought and investigation the percentage only increased because IPv4 reduces. Sometimes graphs can be misinterpreted, yet Happy Eyeballs still did a good job even as end users were being affected.</p><p>Happy Eyeballs, described in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8305\">RFC8305</a>, is a mechanism where a client (lets say a mobile device) tries to connect to a website both on IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously. IPv6 is sometimes given a head-start. The theory is that, should a failure exist on one of the paths (sadly IPv6 is the norm), then IPv4 will save the day. Monday was a day of opposites for Verizon.</p><p>In fact, enabling IPv6 for mobile users is the one area where we can praise the Verizon network this week (or at least the Verizon mobile network), unlike the residential Verizon networks where IPv6 is almost non-existent.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"using-bandwidth-graphs-to-confirm-routing-leaks-and-stability\">Using bandwidth graphs to confirm routing leaks and stability.</h3>\n            <a href=\"#using-bandwidth-graphs-to-confirm-routing-leaks-and-stability\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As we have already stated,Verizon had impacted their own users/customers.
