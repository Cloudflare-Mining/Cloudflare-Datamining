That mission has driven us to build one of the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\"><u>world’s largest networks</u></a>, to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/content-independence-day-no-ai-crawl-without-compensation/\"><u>stand up for content providers</u></a>, and to innovate relentlessly to make the Internet safer, faster, and more reliable for everyone, everywhere.</p><p>Building world-class products is only part of the battle, however. Fulfilling our mission means making these products accessible, including a pricing model that is fair, predictable, and aligned with the value we provide. If our packaging is confusing, or if our pricing penalizes you for using the service, then we’re not living up to our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/about-overview/\"><u>mission</u></a>. And the best way to ensure that alignment?</p><p>Listen to our customers.</p><p>Over the years, your feedback has shaped our product roadmap, helping us evolve to offer <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/products/\"><u>nearly 100 products</u></a> across four solution areas — <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/#application-services-case-products\"><u>Application Services</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/#network-services-products\"><u>Network Services</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/#platform-capabilities\"><u>Zero Trust Services</u></a>, and our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/developer-platform/\"><u>Developer Platform</u></a> — on a single, unified platform and network infrastructure. Recently, we’ve heard a new theme emerge: the need for simplicity. You’ve asked us, “A hundred products is a lot. Can you please be more prescriptive?” and “Can you make your pricing more straightforward?”</p><p>We heard that feedback loud and clear.

A WAF from one vendor, a DDoS scrubber from another, a VPN from a third. The result is a mess of complexity, vendor lock-in, and a security posture riddled with gaps.

The old models were built for a world where everyone came into an office. The world has changed: in today’s hybrid work environment, your internal network isn&#39;t just confined to your offices and data centers anymore. It&#39;s wherever your employees and data are. But many vendors still effectively charge you twice for the same user — once for the seat and again when they’re using the office network.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4tj5DIu3g9Nt3Bofez1wrt/33e87281bc08e37aec8a7cd968bab7eb/image3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1162\" height=\"417\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>We believe you should never pay for user bandwidth. Our model recognizes that a user is a user, wherever they are; we don’t double-charge for bandwidth; we actually subtract the traffic that’s generated from user device clients from your WAN meter. We’ve gone a step further: every Interna user license contributes to a shared bandwidth pool that you can use to build a modern, secure, and fast corporate WAN. With Interna, the budget you already have for security now builds your corporate network, too.</p><p>What does this mean for you?</p><ul><li><p><b>Never pay for user bandwidth:</b> a single per-seat price covers your users wherever they work, reducing your WAN bill and eliminating the hybrid work penalty.</p></li><li><p><b>Each license expands your WAN:</b> pooled bandwidth from user licenses helps you replace expensive, dedicated WAN contracts.</p></li><li><p><b>All-inclusive security: </b>premium features like Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) and both in-line and API-based Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) are included, not expensive add-ons.</p></li></ul>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5WBGLrGyg3qtl7F3qCv02O/6175c2b9bb15676b42b50247675cb814/image5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"833\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"the-unifying-cloudflare-advantage\">The unifying Cloudflare advantage</h2>\n      <a href=\"#the-unifying-cloudflare-advantage\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Our unique advantage has always been our network. Serving millions of customers — from individual developers on our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/\"><u>Free plan</u></a> to the world’s largest enterprises — on one platform and one global network gives us incredible leverage. It’s what allows us to offer robust <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-commitment-to-free/\"><u>free services</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/\"><u>protect journalists and nonprofits</u></a>. It’s also what makes our platform structurally better: our AI models are trained on data from <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/proxy/all/q\"><u>20% of the web</u></a>, providing more effective threat detection than siloed platforms ever could.</p><p>We believe that the same structural advantage should help businesses of all sizes scale without compromise. As companies grow, they often face a difficult choice: does the patchwork of point products they started with become too complex to manage, or does the integrated platform they chose become too limited? You asked for a more prescriptive path, one that solves this false choice.</p><p>With our new Externa and Interna bundles, that trade-off is over. The Essentials, Advantage, and Premier tiers in each family are designed to provide a clear path for businesses of all sizes, allowing you to adopt stage-appropriate networking and security solutions that scale seamlessly. As your business grows, you move up the tiers from Essentials to Advantage to Premier, gaining access to more advanced features along the way.
