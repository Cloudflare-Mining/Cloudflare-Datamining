We understand that not all users are intimately familiar with the command line nor are they deploying tunnel in an environment or OS they’re most comfortable with. To alleviate that burden, we designed a comprehensive onboarding guide with pathways for MacOS, Windows, and Linux for our two primary onboarding flows:</p><ol><li><p>Connecting an <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps\">origin to Cloudflare</a></p></li><li><p>Connecting a private network via <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/warp-to-tunnel\">WARP to Tunnel</a></p></li></ol><p>Our new onboarding guide walks through each command required to create, route, and run your tunnel successfully while also highlighting relevant validation commands to serve as guardrails along the way. Once completed, you’ll be able to view and manage your newly established tunnels.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"managing-your-tunnels\">Managing your tunnels</h3>\n            <a href=\"#managing-your-tunnels\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6574ihZ3Lv32PE6Ycfrrkp/3283a69eaa5a2e17e68d8665de68344c/image1-43.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1564\" height=\"1136\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When thinking about the new user interface for tunnel we wanted to concentrate our efforts on how users gain visibility into their tunnels today. It was important that we provide the same level of observability, but through the lens of a visual, interactive dashboard. Specifically, we strove to build a familiar experience like the one a user may see if they were to run <code>cloudflared tunnel list</code> to show all of their tunnels, or <code>cloudflared tunnel info</code> if they wanted to better understand the connection status of a specific tunnel.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3bI6i82oBS4t9ccPrfpdj7/71fb08956210e44652c8e7e73e8b34da/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-1.07.21-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1664\" height=\"908\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In the interface, you can quickly search by name or filter by name, status, uptime, or creation date. This allows users to easily identify and manage the tunnels they need, when they need them. We also included other key metrics such as <b>Status</b> and <b>Uptime</b>.</p><p>A tunnel&#39;s status depends on the health of its connections:</p><ul><li><p><b>Active</b>: This means your tunnel is running and has a healthy connection to the Cloudflare network.</p></li><li><p><b>Inactive</b>: This means your tunnel is not running and is not connected to Cloudflare.</p></li><li><p><b>Degraded</b>: This means one or more of your <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps\">four long-lived TCP connections</a> to Cloudflare have been disconnected, but traffic is still being served to your origin.</p></li></ul><p>A tunnel’s uptime is also calculated by the health of its connections. We perform this calculation by determining the UTC timestamp of when the first (of four) long-lived TCP connections is established with the Cloudflare Edge. In the event this single connection is terminated, we will continue tracking uptime as long as one of the other three connections continues to serve traffic. If no connections are active, Uptime will reset to zero.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"tunnel-routes-and-connectors\">Tunnel Routes and Connectors</h3>\n            <a href=\"#tunnel-routes-and-connectors\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Last year, shortly after the announcement of Named Tunnels, we released a new feature that allowed users to utilize the same Named Tunnel to serve traffic to <a href=\"/many-services-one-cloudflared/\">many different services</a> through the use of <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/configuration-file/ingress\">Ingress Rules</a>. In the new UI, if you’re running your tunnels in this manner, you’ll be able to see these various services reflected by hovering over the route&#39;s value in the dashboard. Today, this includes routes for DNS records, Load Balancers, and Private IP ranges.</p><p>Even more recently, we announced highly available and highly scalable instances of cloudflared, known more commonly as “<a href=\"/highly-available-and-highly-scalable-cloudflare-tunnels/\">cloudflared replicas</a>.” To view your <code>cloudflared</code> replicas, select and expand a tunnel. Then you will identify how many <code>cloudflared</code> replicas you’re running for a given tunnel, as well as the corresponding connection status, data center, IP address, and version. And ultimately, when you’re ready to delete a tunnel, you can do so directly from the dashboard as well.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next</h3>\n            <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Moving forward, we’re excited to begin incorporating more Cloudflare Tunnel analytics into our dashboard.
