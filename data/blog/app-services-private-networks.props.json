Rather than deploying services in specific locations - for example, using some of our points of presence to enforce <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">WAF</a> policies, others for Zero Trust controls, and others for traffic optimization - every server runs a virtually identical stack of all of our software services. This way, a packet can land on any server and flow through a full set of security filters in a single pass, without having to incur the performance tax of hair pinning to multiple locations.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2feVltGTqj2dzzVvq7r0YQ/79109c393e7cddb0038c813c5074867a/image1-38.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The software that runs on each of these servers is Linux-based and takes advantage of core concepts of the Linux kernel in order to create “wiring” between services.

They also are excited about the potential to extend load balancing policies into their local networks, managing traffic across servers within a datacenter or cloud property in addition to across multiple “global” locations.
