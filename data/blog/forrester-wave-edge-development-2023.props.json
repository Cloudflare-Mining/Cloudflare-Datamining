But to you, it’s a single application that you can <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/local-development-and-testing/\">run and test locally</a>, using the same <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd\">open-source JavaScript runtime</a> that your Workers run on in production.</p></li><li><p>When you deploy a <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/\">Durable Object</a> to coordinate real-time state, you’ve built a distributed application, but instead of having to learn RPC protocols and scale infrastructure, you’ve programmed the whole thing in JavaScript using web standard APIs that front-end developers know and rely on daily.</p></li><li><p>Enqueuing and processing batches of messages with <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/\">Cloudflare Queues</a> takes adding just a few more lines of JavaScript to an existing Worker.</p></li><li><p>When you create a web application with <a href=\"https://pages.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Pages</a>, you’ve set up a complete continuous build and deployment pipeline with preview URLs, just by connecting to a GitHub repository.</p></li></ul><p>Developers who previously only wrote front-end code are able to build the back end, and make their app real-time and reactive. Teams stuck waiting for infrastructure experts to provision resources are able to start prototyping today rather than next week. Writing and deploying a Worker is familiar and accessible, and this lets engineering teams move faster, with less overhead.</p><p>Why are teams able to get started so quickly?</p><ol><li><p>Workers use <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/\">web standard APIs</a> that front-end developers and anyone building web applications already use every day. Cloudflare was a founding member of the Web-interoperable Runtimes Community Group (<a href=\"https://wintercg.org/\">WinterCG</a>) and is committed to <a href=\"/socket-api-works-javascript-runtimes-wintercg-polyfill-connect/\">interoperability across runtimes</a>.</p></li><li><p>The tools developers already use every day are native to our platform. We publish <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/workers-types\">TypeScript</a> types for all APIs, and support compiling TypeScript when authoring and deploying via the Wrangler CLI or via the code editor in the Cloudflare dashboard — which itself is <a href=\"/improved-quick-edit/\">powered by</a> the popular VSCode editor.</p></li><li><p>The open-source <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/\">frameworks</a> that developers prefer to build with are supported. A growing set of APIs from Node.js are <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/\">available natively</a> in the Workers runtime, allowing existing open source libraries to work on Workers. And increasingly, new open source projects that developers depend on are designed from day one to work across all WinterCG runtimes.

And as every company and every developer is now building or experimenting with AI, Cloudflare has <a href=\"/workers-ai\">made GPUs an integrated part of our developer platform</a>. We’ve made it just as easy to get started with AI as we have to deliver a global workload. In mid-November, we hit our goal to have Workers AI Inference running in <a href=\"/workers-ai-update-stable-diffusion-code-llama-workers-ai-in-100-cities/\">over 100 cities</a> around the world, and by the end of the 2024 Workers AI will be running in nearly every city Cloudflare has a presence in.</p><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/\">Workers AI</a> allows developers to build applications using the latest open-source AI models, without provisioning any infrastructure or paying for costly unused capacity. We’re extending this to support <a href=\"/partnering-with-hugging-face-deploying-ai-easier-affordable/\">deploying models directly from Hugging Face to Workers AI</a>, for an even wider set of AI models. And unlike provisioning a VM with a GPU in a specific data center, we’re building this such that we can treat our whole network as one giant compute resource, running models in the right place at the right time to serve developers’ needs.</p><p>Beyond model inference, we’re doubling down on supporting web standard APIs and making the <a href=\"/webgpu-in-workers/\">WebGPU</a> API available from within the Workers platform. While we’re proud to be recognized as a leading edge platform, we’re not just that —we are a platform for developing full-stack applications, even those that require compute power that just one year ago very few used or needed.</p><p>We’re excited to show you what’s next, including <a href=\"/secrets-store/\">a new way to manage secrets</a> across Cloudflare products, improved observability, and better tools for releasing changes. Every day we see more advanced applications built on our platform, and we’re committed to matching that with tools to serve the most mission-critical workloads — the same ones we use ourselves to build our products on our own platform.</p><p>Download the report <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/lp/forrester-wave-edge-development-q4-2023/\">here</a>.</p>",
