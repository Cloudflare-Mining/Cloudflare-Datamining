The exploit allowed them to intercept requests, expose servers and APIs, and send fake alerts to some app users, including a message that a “<a href=\"https://www.bitdefender.co.uk/blog/hotforsecurity/hacktivists-send-fake-nuclear-attack-warning-via-israeli-red-alert-app/\">nuclear bomb is coming</a>”.

The malicious apps obtained access to sensitive user information such as mobile phone’s contacts list, SMS messages, phone call logs, installed applications, and information about the phone and SIM card themselves.
