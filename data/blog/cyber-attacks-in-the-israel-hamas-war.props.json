According to <a href=\"https://cybernews.com/cyber-war/israel-redalert-breached-anonghost-hamas/\">Cybernews</a>, one of those groups, AnonGhost, exploited a vulnerability in a mobile app that alerts Israeli civilians of incoming rockets, “Red Alert: Israel”. The exploit allowed them to intercept requests, expose servers and APIs, and send fake alerts to some app users, including a message that a “<a href=\"https://www.bitdefender.co.uk/blog/hotforsecurity/hacktivists-send-fake-nuclear-attack-warning-via-israeli-red-alert-app/\">nuclear bomb is coming</a>”. AnonGhost also claimed to have attacked various other rocket alert apps.</p><p>On October 14, we revealed the findings of one of our investigations that was conducted by the <a href=\"/introducing-cloudforce-one-threat-operations-and-threat-research/\">Cloudforce One</a> Threat Operations team, who identified malicious Android mobile applications impersonating the legitimate RedAlert - Rocket Alerts application. The malicious apps obtained access to sensitive user information such as mobile phone’s contacts list, SMS messages, phone call logs, installed applications, and information about the phone and SIM card themselves.
