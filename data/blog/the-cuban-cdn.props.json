I managed that (at a price) but also saw for myself how Cubans get access to an alternate Internet delivered by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet\">sneakernet</a>.</p><p>Cuba is currently poorly served by the Internet with a small number of public WiFi hotspots. There are currently <a href=\"http://www.etecsa.cu/?page=internet_conectividad&sub=wifi\">175 public WiFi</a> hotspots in the country, many in public parks. In addition, many large hotels also have public WiFi. Since this is the primary way Cubans get Internet access it’s not uncommon to see situations like this:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/420bnDWFn5o9GN5k84ieoF/4b890f404d03bdfd748921703b2bc05f/DSC_0200-1.JPG.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Getting on the WiFi means buying a card that gives you access for 2 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_convertible_peso\">CUC</a> ($2) per hour. These cards have a login number and a password (hidden behind a scratch off panel). The hour can be used in chunks by logging off and on.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7nx2YWwfac8kE4IiA7xLop/f7c06e7a16d7e30b9c21b9866fc30067/IMG_6986-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2362\" height=\"1478\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>There’s also mobile phone access to the Internet (I saw 3G, EDGE and GPRS as I traveled across Cuba), but at <a href=\"http://www.etecsa.cu/?page=telefonia_movil&sub=tarifas\">1 CUC ($1) per MB</a> it’s very expensive. The phone company does provide email access (to their own <a href=\"http://www.etecsa.cu/?page=telefonia_movil&sub=movil_nauta\">email service</a>) and so some Cubans I met used their phones to get email, but I didn’t come across anyone who used the web on their phone.</p><p>I was able to use 3G Internet access from my phone (via my home carrier) but curiously got a certificate error trying to access my CloudFlare email and decided not to proceed and discover why!</p><p>The overall story is that currently there is limited access to the Internet but that it is expensive (especially for Cubans).</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"enter-el-paquete\">Enter El Paquete</h2>\n            <a href=\"#enter-el-paquete\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2o8BmWr7GL4jlGUW8HXZoM/0c99860a54a90a5538b25092c4cd17a5/IMG_7055-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>To work around this problem everyone I spoke to had access to Cuba’s private “CDN”: <i>El Paquete Semanal</i>. El Paquete is a weekly service where someone (typically found through word of mouth) comes to your home with a disk (usually a 1TB external USB drive) containing a weekly download of the most recent films, soap operas, documentaries, sport, music, mobile apps, magazines, and even web sites. For 2 CUC a week Cubans have access to a huge repository of media while turning a blind eye to copyright.</p><p>Cubans told me of children waiting anxiously for “El Paquete Day” when they’d get the next set of cartoons, music and shows.</p><p>Vox wrote a nice <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/9/21/9352095/netflix-cuba-paquete-internet\">article</a> that describes El Paquete and includes this short film from Cuba and its creation.</p><p>. . . . . . . .</p><p>Being a nerd I talked for a long time with Cubans about El Paquete and was intrigued when one of them mentioned that “it even includes this week’s antivirus update”. Makes sense when you realize people can’t get the latest update downloaded across the Internet. And more than that it piqued my interest in examining a copy of El Paquete and seeing what was really included.</p><p>I managed to get access to El Paquete Semanal for the week of March 21, 2016<a href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a>. This edition of El Paquete is 815.25 GB and contained 14,208 files. It’s an immense effort to update that on a weekly basis.</p><p>Here’s the top level directory of El Paquete showing the major categories of media available.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            <a href=/content/images/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-04-at-10-04-31.png>\n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/YZH2auEWpFC5S6k5Ix54b/6c0ed1804607ab2b55d6ee7dc4fda080/Screen-Shot-2016-08-04-at-10-04-31.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1210\" height=\"556\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            </a>\n            </figure><p>Sure enough, right there is <i>Actualizacion Antivirus</i> which contains antivirus updates for Avast, AVG, Avira, BitDefender, ClamAV, Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft Security Essentials, ESET and Norton.</p><p>The McAfee update was 8107xdat.exe which was released by McAfee on March 17, 2016. So, just four days later that update was in the hands of Cubans. The ClamAV was from the same date.</p><p>I scanned the entire disk with the latest Sophos release and it showed up three infected files: all in the <i>Aplicaciones Para Pc</i> directory (i.e within PC apps).

There’s also Cosmopolitan (April), Bloomberg Businessweek (March 14), Maxim (March), New Scientist (March 5), The Week (March 11) and a number of other specialist magazines.
