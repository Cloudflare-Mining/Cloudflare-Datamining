If networks are like towns, peering is the bridges, highways, and streets that connect the networks together. There are lots of different ways to connect networks together, but when networks connect, traffic between them flows to their destination faster. The reason for this is that peering reduces the number of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hops between networks.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"what-is-bgp\">What is BGP?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#what-is-bgp\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>For a quick refresher, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/\">Border Gateway Protocol</a> (or BGP for short) is a protocol that propagates instructions on how networks should forward packets so that traffic can get from its origin to its destination. BGP provides packets instructions on how to get from one network to another by indicating which networks the packets need to go through to get to the destination, prioritizing the paths with the smallest number of hops between origin and destination. BGP sees networks as Autonomous Systems (AS), and each AS has its own number. For example, Cloudflare’s ASN is 13335.</p><p>In the example below, AS 1 is trying to send packets to AS 3, but there are two possible paths the packets can go:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5fCNEjOO8bFStrKBlS0Arw/dd1387ec2ecbb4896e9aa564ebb1acbc/image6-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"878\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The BGP decision algorithm will select the path with the least number of hops, meaning that the path the packets will take is AS 1 → AS 2 → AS 3.</p><p>When two networks peer with each other, the number of networks needed to connect AS 1 and AS 3 is reduced to one, because AS 1 and AS 3 are directly connected with each other. But “connecting with” another network can be kind of vague, so let’s be more specific. In general, there are three ways that networks can connect with other networks: directly through Private Network Interconnects (PNI), at Internet Exchanges (IX), and through transit networks that connect with many networks.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"private-network-interconnect\">Private Network Interconnect</h3>\n      <a href=\"#private-network-interconnect\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>A private network interconnect (PNI) sounds complicated, but it’s really simple at its core: it’s a cable connecting two networks to each other.

These networks peer at Internet Exchanges and directly with many other networks to provide connectivity for your network without having to get PNIs or IX presence with networks. This service comes at a price, and may impact network performance as the transit network is an intermediary hop between your network and the place your traffic is trying to reach.

But let’s take a second to talk about why peering is so important.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"why-is-peering-important\">Why is peering important?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#why-is-peering-important\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Peering is important on the Internet for three reasons: it distributes traffic across many networks reducing single points of failure of the Internet, it often reduces bandwidth prices on the Internet making overall costs lower, and it improves performance by removing network hops. Let&#39;s talk about each of those benefits.</p><p>Peering improves the overall uptime of the Internet by distributing traffic across multiple networks, meaning that if one network goes down, traffic from your network will still be able to reach your users. Compare that to connecting to a transit network: if the transit network has an issue, your network will be unreachable because that network was the only thing connecting your network to the rest of the Internet (unless you decide to pay multiple transit providers). With peering, any individual network failure will not completely impact the ability for your users to reach your network.</p><p>Peering helps reduce your network bandwidth costs because it distributes the cost you pay an Internet Exchange for a port across all the networks you interconnect with at the IX. If you&#39;re paying \\$1000/month for a port at an IX, and you&#39;re peered with 100 networks there, you&#39;re effectively paying \\$10/network, as opposed to paying \\$1000/month to connect to one transit network. Furthermore, many networks including Cloudflare have open peering policies and settlement free peering, which means we don&#39;t charge you to send traffic to us or the other way round, making peering even more economical.</p><p>Peering also improves performance for Internet traffic by bringing networks closer together, reducing the time it takes for a packet to go from one network to another. The more two networks peer with each other, the more physical places on the planet they can exchange traffic directly, meaning that users everywhere see better performance.</p><p>Here’s an example. Janine is trying to order food from Acme Food Services, a site protected by Cloudflare. She lives in Boston and connects to Cloudflare via her ISP. Acme Food Services has their origin in Boston as well, so for Janine to see the fastest performance, her ISP should connect to Cloudflare in Boston and then Cloudflare should route her traffic directly to the Acme origin in Boston. Unfortunately for Janine, her ISP doesn’t peer with Cloudflare in Boston, but instead peers with Cloudflare in New York: meaning that when Janine connects to Acme, her traffic is going through her ISP to New York before it reaches Cloudflare, and then all the way back to Boston to the Acme origins!</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3NcWwy6hBN1nUY8V2xdkX9/6aba383e4cdf25084d5c1df8362d65e5/image2-11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1172\" height=\"635\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>But with proper peering, we can ensure that traffic is routed over the fastest possible path to ensure Janine connects to Cloudflare in Boston and everything stays local:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/65pTmQFpQ8GO5tclIcfCZm/5a34f5d91c32a5be9312cda0577ad950/image3-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"606\" height=\"635\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Fortunately for Janine, Cloudflare peers with over 10,000 networks in the world in over 275 locations, so high latency on the network is rare. And every time a new network peers with us, we help make user traffic even faster. So now let’s talk about how we’ve made peering even easier.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"cloudflare-peering-portal-supports-peeringdb-login\">Cloudflare Peering Portal supports PeeringDB login</h2>\n      <a href=\"#cloudflare-peering-portal-supports-peeringdb-login\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare, along with many other networks, rely on <a href=\"https://www.peeringdb.com/\">PeeringDB</a> as a source of truth for which networks are present on the Internet.

Well now you can!</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"requesting-sessions-in-the-peering-portal\">Requesting sessions in the Peering Portal</h2>\n      <a href=\"#requesting-sessions-in-the-peering-portal\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Starting today, you can now request peering sessions with Cloudflare at Internet Exchanges right from the peering portal, making it even easier to get connected with Cloudflare. When you’re looking at potential peering sessions in the portal, you’ll now see a button that will allow you to verify your peering information is correct, and if it is to proceed with a peering request:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/23BphHjyLZvbn9oOnFq6RY/b3181625f4efb7a2166df379afb23588/image1-13.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1188\" height=\"686\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Once you click that button, a ticket will go immediately to our network team to configure a peering session with you using the details already provided in PeeringDB. Our network team looks at whether we already have existing connections with your network at that location, and also what the impact to your Internet traffic will be if we peer with you there. Once we’ve evaluated these variables, we’ll proceed to establish a BGP session with you at the location and inform you via email that you’ve already provided via PeeringDB. Then all you have to do is accept the BGP sessions, and you’ll be exchanging traffic with Cloudflare!</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"peer-with-cloudflare-today\">Peer with Cloudflare today!</h2>\n      <a href=\"#peer-with-cloudflare-today\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>It has never been easier to peer with Cloudflare, and our simplified peering portal will make it even easier to get connected.
