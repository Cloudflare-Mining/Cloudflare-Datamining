Although learning and exercising may have started to get back to something close to normal (depending on the country), the effects of what started almost two years ago on the way people <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/09/01/the-internet-and-the-pandemic/\">work and communicate</a> seems to be here to stay, and the lockdowns or restrictions continue to have an impact on where and how people go online.</p><p>So, Cloudflare Radar&#39;s <a href=\"http://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review-2021\">2021 Year In Review</a> is out with interactive maps and charts you can use to explore what changed on the Internet throughout this past year. <a href=\"http://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review-2021\">Year In Review</a> is part of <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a>. We launched <a href=\"/introducing-cloudflare-radar/\">Radar</a> in September 2020 to give anyone access to Internet use and abuse trends.</p><p>This year we’ve added a mobile vs desktop traffic chart, but also the attack distribution that shows the evolution throughout the year — the beginning of July 2021, more than a month after the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline_ransomware_attack\">Colonial Pipeline</a> cyberattack, was the time of the year when attacks worldwide peaked.</p><p>There are also interesting pandemic-related trends like the (lack) of Internet activity in Tokyo with the Summer Olympics in town and how Thanksgiving week in the US in late November affected mobile traffic in the United States.</p><p>You can also check our <a href=\"/popular-domains-year-in-review-2021/\">Popular Domains — 2021 Year in Review</a> where TikTok, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/\">e-commerce</a> and space companies had a big year.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"internet-growing-steadily-with-lockdown-bumps\">Internet: growing steadily (with lockdown bumps)</h3>\n            <a href=\"#internet-growing-steadily-with-lockdown-bumps\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In 2020 by late April we <a href=\"/recent-trends-in-internet-traffic/\">saw</a> that the Internet had seen incredible, sudden growth in traffic because of lockdowns and that was sustained throughout the year as we showed in our <a href=\"/cloudflare-radar-2020-year-in-review/\">2020 Year In Review</a>. 2021 told a slightly different story, depending on the country.</p><p>The big March-April and May Internet traffic peak from 2020 related to the pandemic wasn’t there, in the same way, this year — it was more distributed depending on the local restrictions. In 2021, Internet traffic, globally, continued to grow throughout the year, and it was at the end of the year that was higher (a normal trend, given there’s a growth in categories like <a href=\"/thanksgivings-biggest-online-shopping-day-was-cyber-monday-but-other-days-were-close-behind/\">online shopping</a> and the colder season in the Northern Hemisphere, where most Internet traffic occurs, affects human behaviour).</p><p>The day of the year with the highest growth in traffic worldwide, from our standpoint, was December 2, 2021, with 20% more than the first week of the year — the Y-axis shows the percentage change in Internet traffic using a cohort of top domains from each country. But in May there was also a bump (highlighted in red as a possible pandemic-related occurrence), although not as high as we saw in the March-May period of last year.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"spikes-in-internet-traffic-worldwide-2021\">Spikes in Internet traffic — Worldwide 2021</h3>\n            <a href=\"#spikes-in-internet-traffic-worldwide-2021\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>#1 November-December<sup>1</sup> (+23%)</p><p>#2 September (+20%)</p><p>#3 October (+19%)</p><p>#4 August (+16%)</p><p>#5 May (+13%)</p><p><sup>1</sup>Beginning of December</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/GUcPohN92uv80aZupNxsr/6690a957f6038712751090999ec2ca9f/image1-112.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1167\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>When we focus on specific countries using our <a href=\"http://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review-2021\">Year In Review 2021</a> page you can see that new restrictions or lockdowns affected (again) Internet traffic and, in some countries, that is more evident than others.</p><p>In the following table, we show the months with the highest traffic growth (the percentage shown focus on the spikes).
