If you’re part of a team building products with configuration in our Dashboard, chances are you&#39;re using PostgreSQL. It’s fast, versatile, reliable, and backed by over 30 years of development and real-world use. It has been a foundational part of our infrastructure since the beginning, and today we run hundreds of PostgreSQL instances across a wide range of configurations and replication setups.</p><p>ClickHouse is a more recent addition to our stack. We started using it around 2017, and it has enabled us to ingest tens of millions of rows per second while supporting millisecond-level query performance. ClickHouse is a remarkable technology, but like all systems, it involves trade-offs.</p><p>In this post, I’ll explain why we chose TimescaleDB — a Postgres extension — over ClickHouse to build the analytics and reporting capabilities in our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/\"><u>Zero Trust product suite</u></a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"designing-for-future-growth\">Designing for future growth</h2>\n            <a href=\"#designing-for-future-growth\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>After a decade in software development, I’ve grown to appreciate systems that are simple and boring. Over time, I’ve found myself consistently advocating for architectures with the fewest moving parts possible. Whenever I see a system diagram with more than three boxes, I ask: <i>Why are all these components here? Do we really need all of this?</i></p><p>As engineers, it&#39;s easy to fall into the trap of designing for scenarios that might never happen. We imagine future scale, complex failure scenarios, or edge cases, and start building solutions for them upfront. But in reality, systems often don’t grow the way we expect, or don’t <i>have to</i>. Designing for large scale can be deferred by setting the right expectations with customers, and by adding guardrails like product limits and rate limits. Focusing on launching initial versions of products with just a few essential parts, maybe two or three components, gives us something to ship, test, and learn from quickly. We can always add complexity later, but only once it’s clear we need it.</p><p>Whether I specifically call it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it\"><u>YAGNI</u></a>, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\"><u>Keep it simple, stupid</u></a>, or think about it as minimalism in engineering, the core idea is the same: <b>we’re rarely good at predicting the future, and every additional component we introduce carries a cost.</b> Each box in the system diagram is something that can break itself or other boxes, spiral into outages, and ruin weekend plans of on-call engineers. Each box also requires documentation, tests, observability, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective\"><u>service level objectives (SLOs)</u></a>. Oftentimes, teams need to learn a new programming language just to support a new box.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"making-digital-experience-monitoring-simple\">Making Digital Experience Monitoring simple</h2>\n            <a href=\"#making-digital-experience-monitoring-simple\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Two years ago, I was tasked with building a new product at Cloudflare: <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/\"><u>Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX)</u></a>. DEX provides <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-digital-experience-monitoring/\"><u>visibility</u></a> into device, network, and application performance across <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\"><u>Zero Trust</u></a> environments. Our initial goal was clear — <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-digital-experience-monitoring/\"><u>launch an MVP</u></a> focused on fleet status monitoring and synthetic tests, giving customers actionable analytics and troubleshooting. From a technical standpoint, fleet status and synthetic tests are two types of structured logs generated by the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/\"><u>WARP client</u></a>. These logs are uploaded to an API, stored in a database, and ultimately visualized in the <a href=\"https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/\"><u>Cloudflare Dashboard</u></a>. </p><p>As with many new engineering teams at Cloudflare, DEX started as a “tiger team”: a small group of experienced engineers tasked with validating a new product quickly. I worked with the following constraints:</p><ul><li><p>Team of three full-stack engineers.</p></li><li><p>Daily collaboration with 2-3 other teams.</p></li><li><p>Can launch in beta, engineering can drive product limits.</p></li><li><p>Emphasis on shipping fast.</p></li></ul><p>To strike a balance between usefulness and simplicity, we made deliberate design decisions early on:</p><ul><li><p>Fleet status logs would be uploaded from WARP clients at fixed 2-minute intervals.</p></li><li><p>Synthetic tests required users to preconfigure them by target (HTTP or traceroute) and frequency.</p></li><li><p>We capped usage: each device could run up to 10 synthetic tests, no more than once every 5 minutes.</p></li><li><p>Data retention of 7 days.</p></li></ul><p>These guardrails gave us room to ship DEX months earlier and gather early feedback from customers without prematurely investing in scalability and performance.</p><p>We knew we needed a basic <b>configuration plane </b>— an interface in the <a href=\"https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/\"><u>Dashboard</u></a> for users to create and manage synthetic tests, supported by an API and database to persist this data. That led us to the following setup:</p><ul><li><p>HTTP API for managing test configurations.</p></li><li><p>PostgreSQL for storing those configurations.</p></li><li><p>React UI embedded in the Cloudflare Dashboard.</p></li></ul>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2Qz0VnYZOG35OC3fd76W67/3dbe226e4cdef8d91c925224c5e43256/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"764\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Just three components — simple, focused, and exactly what we needed. Of course, each of these boxes came with real complexity under the hood. PostgreSQL was deployed as a high-availability cluster: one primary, one synchronous replica for failover scenarios, and several asynchronous replicas distributed across two geographies. The API was deployed on horizontally scaled Kubernetes pods across two geographies. The React app was served globally as standard via Cloudflare’s network. Thanks to our platform teams, all of that complexity was abstracted away, allowing us to think in terms of just three essential parts, but it really shows that each box can come with a huge cost behind the scenes. </p><p>Next, we needed to build the <b>analytics plane </b>— an ingestion pipeline to collect structured logs from WARP clients, store them, and visualize them for our customers in the Dashboard. I was personally excited to explore ClickHouse for this. I have seen its performance in other projects and was eager to experiment with it. But as I dug into the internal documentation on how to get started with ClickHouse, reality set in:</p><blockquote><p><i>Writing data to Clickhouse</i></p><p><i>Your service must generate logs in a clear format, using Cap&#39;n Proto or Protocol Buffers. Logs should be written to a socket for logfwdr to transport to PDX, then to a Kafka topic. Use a Concept:Inserter to read from Kafka, batching data to achieve a write rate of less than one batch per second.</i></p></blockquote><p>Oh. That’s a lot. Including ClickHouse and the WARP client, we’re looking at five boxes to be added to the system diagram. This architecture exists for good reason, though. The default and most commonly used table engine in ClickHouse, MergeTree, is optimized for high-throughput batch inserts. It writes each insert as a separate partition, then runs background merges to keep data manageable. This makes writes very fast, but not when they arrive in lots of tiny batches, which was exactly our case with millions of individual devices uploading one log event every 2 minutes. Too many small writes can trigger write amplification, resource contention, and throttling. </p><p>So it became clear that ClickHouse is a sports car and to get value out of it we had to bring it to a race track, shift into high gear, and drive it at top speed. But we didn’t need a race car — we needed a daily driver for short trips to a grocery store. For our initial launch, we didn’t need millions of inserts per second. We needed something easy to set up, reliable, familiar, and good enough to get us to market. A colleague suggested we just use PostgreSQL, quoting “it can be cranked up” to handle the load we were expecting. So, we took the leap!</p><p>First design of configuration and analytics plane for DEX:</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1hqhwCJXGIzffw77xgabiW/c1afd012c972c39112aee0660f53129a/3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1057\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"using-postgresql-for-analytics\">Using PostgreSQL for analytics</h2>\n            <a href=\"#using-postgresql-for-analytics\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Structurally, there’s not much difference between configuration data and analytical logs. Logs are simply structured payloads — often in JSON — that can be transformed into a columnar format and persisted in a relational database.</p><p>Here’s an example of a device state log:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-JSON\"><code class=\"language-JSON\">{\n  “timestamp”: “2025-06-16T22:50:12.226Z”,\n  “accountId”: “025779fde8cd4ab8a3e5138f870584a7”,\n  “deviceId”: “07dfde77-3f8a-4431-89f7-acfcf4ead4fc”,\n  “colo”: “SJC”,\n  “status”: “connected”,\n  “mode”: “warp+doh”,\n  “clientVersion”: “2024.3.409.0”,\n  “clientPlatform”: “windows”,\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>To store these logs, we created a simple PostgreSQL table:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-SQL\"><code class=\"language-SQL\">CREATE TABLE device_state (\n\t&quot;timestamp&quot; TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,\n\taccount_id TEXT NOT NULL,\n\tdevice_id TEXT NOT NULL,\n\tcolo TEXT,\n\tstatus TEXT,\n\tmode TEXT,\n\tclient_version TEXT,\n\tclient_platform TEXT\n);</pre></code>\n            <p>You might notice that this table doesn’t have a primary key. That’s intentional, because time-series data is almost never queried by a unique ID. Instead, we query by time ranges and filter by various attributes (e.g. account ID or device ID). Still, we needed a way to deduplicate logs in case of client retries. </p><p>We created two indexes to optimize for our most common queries:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-SQL\"><code class=\"language-SQL\">CREATE UNIQUE INDEX device_state_device_account_time ON device_state USING btree (device_id, account_id, “timestamp”);\nCREATE INDEX device_state_account_time ON device_state USING btree (account_id, “timestamp”);</pre></code>\n            <p>The unique index ensures deduplication: each (device, account, timestamp) tuple represents a single, unique log. The second index supports typical time-window queries at the account level. Since we always query by account_id (represents individual customers) and timestamp, they are always a part of the index. </p><p>We inserted data from our API using UPSERT query:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-SQL\"><code class=\"language-SQL\">INSERT INTO device_state (…) VALUES (…) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;\n</pre></code>\n            \n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"about-order-of-columns-in-multicolumn-indexes\">About order of columns in multicolumn indexes</h2>\n            <a href=\"#about-order-of-columns-in-multicolumn-indexes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>PostgreSQL&#39;s B-tree indexes support multiple columns, but column order has a major impact on query performance.</p><p>From PostgreSQL documentation <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-multicolumn.html\"><u>about multicolumn indexes</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p><i>A multicolumn B-tree index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index&#39;s columns, but the index is most efficient when there are constraints on the leading (leftmost) columns. The exact rule is that equality constraints on leading columns, plus any inequality constraints on the first column that does not have an equality constraint, will be used to limit the portion of the index that is scanned. Constraints on columns to the right of these columns are checked in the index, so they save visits to the table proper, but they do not reduce the portion of the index that has to be scanned.</i></p></blockquote><p>What’s interesting in time series workloads is that the queries usually have inequality constraints on the time column, and then equality constraints on all other columns. </p><p>A typical query to build line charts and pie charts visualizing data in a time interval often looks like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-SQL\"><code class=\"language-SQL\">SELECT \n  DATE_TRUNC(‘hour’, timestamp) as hour, \n  account_id,\n  device_id,\n  status,\n  COUNT(*) as total\nFROM device_state \nWHERE \n  account_id = ‘a’ AND\n  device_id = ‘b’ AND\n  timestamp BETWEEN ‘2025-07-01’ AND ‘2025-07-02’\nGROUP BY hour, account_id, device_id, status;</pre></code>\n            <p>Notice our WHERE clause — it has equality constraints on account_id and device_id, and two inequality constraints on timestamp. If we had built our index in the order of (timestamp, account_id, device_id), only the “timestamp” section of the index could’ve been used to reduce the index section to be scanned, and account_id and device_id would have to be fully scanned, with values that are not ‘a’ or ‘b’ filtered out after scanning. </p><p>Additionally, the runtime complexity of search in btree is O(log n) — the search will get slower as the size of your table (and all indexes) grows, so another optimization is to reduce the portion of the index that needs to be scanned. Even for columns with equality constraints, you can greatly reduce query times by ordering columns by cardinality.

Instead, we used a cron job that was periodically running custom aggregation queries for all pre-aggregate tables (we had 6 of them). Our Database platform team had a lightweight framework built for data retention purposes that we plugged into. Still, any schema change required cross-team coordination, and we invested considerable time in optimizing aggregation performance.

As we were adding more table columns for new DEX features, we needed to invest time in creating new pre-aggregated tables.

But we didn’t have good enough performance in raw tables.</p><p>One technique we considered to improve performance on raw tables was <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html\"><u>table partitioning</u></a>. In PostgreSQL, tables are stored in one large file (large tables are split to 1 GB segment files). With partitioning, you can break a large table into smaller child tables, each covering a slice of data (e.g. one day of logs). PostgreSQL then scans only the relevant partitions based on your query’s timestamp filter. This can dramatically improve query performance in some cases. </p><p>What was particularly interesting for us was range-partitioning on the timestamp column, because our customers wanted longer data retention, up to one year, and storing one year of data in one large table would have destroyed query performance.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-SQL\"><code class=\"language-SQL\">CREATE TABLE device_state (\n    …\n) PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);\n\nCREATE TABLE device_state_20250601 PARTITION OF device_state\n    FOR VALUES FROM (&#039;2025-06-01&#039;) TO (&#039;2025-06-02&#039;);\nCREATE TABLE device_state_20250601 PARTITION OF device_state\n    FOR VALUES FROM (&#039;2025-06-02&#039;) TO (&#039;2025-06-03&#039;);\nCREATE TABLE device_state_20250601 PARTITION OF device_state\n    FOR VALUES FROM (&#039;2025-06-03&#039;) TO (&#039;2025-06-04&#039;);</pre></code>\n            <p>Unfortunately, PostgreSQL doesn’t automatically manage partitions — you must manually create each one as shown above, so we would have needed to build a full partition management system to automate this.</p><p>We ended up not adopting it because in the end, partitioning didn’t solve our core problem: speeding up frequent dashboard queries on recent raw data up to past 7 days.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"timescaledb\">TimescaleDB</h2>\n            <a href=\"#timescaledb\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>As our raw PostgreSQL setup began to show its limits, we started exploring other options to improve query performance.

In TimescaleDB, compression transforms a hypertable into a columnar format: values from each column are grouped in chunks (typically 1,000 at a time), stored in arrays, and then compressed into binary form.

TimescaleDB has a really clever solution for it by utilizing PostgreSQL <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html\"><u>TOAST</u></a> pages. The way it works is after tuples of 1000 values are compressed, they’re moved to external TOAST pages. The columnstore table itself then basically becomes a table of pointers to TOAST, where actual data is stored and only retrieved lazily, column-by-column.</p><p>The second factor is sparse minmax indexes. The idea behind sparse indexes is that rather than storing every single value in an index, store every N-th value. This makes them much smaller and more efficient to query in very large datasets. TimescaleDB implements minmax sparse indexes, where for each compressed tuple of 1,000 values it creates two additional metadata columns, storing min and max values. The query engine then looks at these columns to determine whether a value could possibly be found in a compressed tuple before attempting to decompress it.</p><p>What we found later, unfortunately, after we did our evaluation of TimescaleDB, is that sparse indexes need to be explicitly enabled via timescaledb.orderby option. Otherwise, TimescaleDB sets it to some default value, which may not always be the most efficient for your queries. We added all columns that we filter on to orderby setting:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-SQL\"><code class=\"language-SQL\">– Add columnstore settings\nALTER TABLE device_state SET (\n    timescaledb.enable_columnstore,\n    timescaledb.segmentby = ‘account_id’,\n    timescaledb.orderby = ‘timestamp,device_id,colo,mode,status,client_version,client_platform\n);</pre></code>\n            \n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"timescaledb-at-cloudflare\">TimescaleDB at Cloudflare</h2>\n            <a href=\"#timescaledb-at-cloudflare\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Following the success with DEX, other teams started exploring TimescaleDB for its simplicity and performance. One notable example is the Zero Trust Analytics &amp; Reporting (ART) team.</p><p>The ART team is responsible for generating analytics and long-term reports — spanning months or even years — for Zero Trust products such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/access/\"><u>Access</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/gateway/\"><u>Gateway</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/casb/\"><u>CASB</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/dlp/\"><u>DLP</u></a>. These datasets live in various ClickHouse and PostgreSQL clusters that we wanted to replicate into a singular home that is specifically designed to unify related, but not co-located data points, together and modeled to address our customer’s analytical needs.</p><p>We chose to use TimescaleDB as the aggregation layer on top of raw logs stored elsewhere. We built a system of crawlers using cron jobs that periodically query the multitude of clusters for hourly aggregates across all customers. These aggregates are ingested into TimescaleDB, where we use continuous aggregates to further roll them up into daily and monthly summaries for reporting.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1Nb8N7QpnumcZiudZHp89m/f59a9558cc4c74fd4a8d0cf6772a27fa/7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1610\" height=\"814\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Access and Gateway datasets are massive, often ingesting millions of rows per second. To support arbitrary filters in reporting, crawler queries group by all relevant fields, including high-cardinality columns like IP addresses. This means the downsampling ratio is low, and in some cases, we&#39;re inserting ~100,000 aggregated rows per second. TimescaleDB handles this load just fine, but to support it we made some adjustments:</p><ul><li><p>We switched from bulk INSERTS to COPY. This significantly improved ingestion throughput. We didn’t benchmark it ourselves, but plenty of <a href=\"https://www.tigerdata.com/learn/testing-postgres-ingest-insert-vs-batch-insert-vs-copy\"><u>benchmarks</u></a> show that COPY performs much better with large batches.</p></li><li><p>We disabled synchronous replication. In our case, temporary data loss is acceptable — our crawlers are idempotent and can reprocess missing data as needed.</p></li><li><p>We also disabled <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/runtime-config-wal.html\"><u>fsync</u></a>. Again, durability is less of a concern for this use case, so skipping disk syncs helped with ingest performance.</p></li><li><p>We dropped most indexes in hypertables, only kept one on (account_id, timestamp), and relied on aggressive compression and sparse indexes. The absence of indexes helped with insert rates and didn’t have a significant impact on query performance, because only a very small part of the table was uncompressed and relied on traditional btree indexes.</p></li></ul><p>You can see this system in action at <a href=\"https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/analytics/overview\"><u>Cloudflare Zero Trust Analytics</u></a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n            <a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Prioritizing core value and resisting the urge to prematurely optimize can accelerate time to market—and sometimes take you on an unexpected journey that leads to better solutions than you&#39;d originally planned. In the early days of DEX, taking a step back to focus on what truly mattered helped us discover TimescaleDB, which turned out to be exactly what we needed.</p><p>Not every team needs a hyper-specialized race car that requires 100 octane fuel, carbon ceramic brakes, and ultra-performance race tires: while each one of these elements boost performance, there&#39;s a real cost towards having those items in the form of maintenance and uniqueness. For many teams at Cloudflare, TimescaleDB strikes a phenomenal balance between the simplicity of storing your analytical data under the same roof as your configuration data, while also gaining much of the impressive performance of a specialized OLAP system.</p><p>Check out TimescaleDB in action by using our robust analytics, reporting, and digital experience monitoring capabilities on our Zero Trust platform.
