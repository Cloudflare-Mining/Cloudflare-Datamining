And I&#39;m willing to bet that in a decade, at least 50% of YC startups will be headquartered outside the US. And so I think the sheer nature of the Internet democratizing information, more companies being global, like Facebook, Google, Uber — talent is everywhere. I think you will see multi-billion dollar companies coming out of other regions.</p><p>People have this perception that everything is a zero sum game, or that we are already at peak Internet penetration. Absolutely not. The global market cap is ~$85 trillion. Less than 10% is e-commerce. Internet enabled businesses is $8 trillion. So even if you play this out for another twenty years, Internet enabled businesses should be at least $66 trillion. So we have a lot more to go. And I think the zero sum game that investors tend to think of, what we&#39;ve gotten wrong is — most of these Internet enabled businesses are expanding TAM.</p><p><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/event/70D7ascnvyxM10mdudCfll\"><i>Watch the full interview</i></a></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"on-democratizing-and-normalizing-mental-health\">On democratizing and normalizing mental health</h3>\n      <a href=\"#on-democratizing-and-normalizing-mental-health\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><b>Karan Singh</b><b>Co-founder and COO of Ginger</b></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/8cFxqFrGZypgRFSphRQ3G/f42ddaa190dc5a07fbd6ebf6c05c0c04/image2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Our vision is a world where mental health is never an obstacle, and that&#39;s a never-ending vision.

And so the people who sit there and say, oh, you know, it&#39;s Apple and Google and Amazon and Microsoft and so forth, and it&#39;s all done. They&#39;re missing the narrative. The narrative is that there&#39;s a new platform emerging which the big guys and the new guys, the new little guys are going to compete over. And that competition will generally be incredibly helpful. It will produce very significant large companies as they figure out a way to monetize. But more importantly, it&#39;ll have an impact on society, both in terms of entertainment, as we saw with TikTok and its predecessors, but also in terms of information and productivity.</p><p><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/event/24ukONvh5qEV02UrSaANHg\"><i>Watch the full interview</i></a></p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"on-the-future-of-video-conferencing\">On the future of video conferencing</h3>\n      <a href=\"#on-the-future-of-video-conferencing\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><b>Eric Yuan</b><b>Founder and CEO of Zoom</b></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3ZEkp1eI2HJYhoIrrmQpzZ/1fdcc750c1a48030c74312b60ab03acf/image5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"250\" height=\"305\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>For now, if we all work from home, from a productivity perspective there&#39;s no productive loss.

The reason why, no matter how good we think it is now — it cannot deliver a better experience than a face-to-face meeting.</p><p>If I didn’t see you for a while, and I wanted to give you a big hug — you cannot feel my intimacy over Zoom, right? And if you are getting a cup of coffee, I can not enjoy the smell, not like when you and I are in a Starbucks.</p><p>I think that technology-wise, in the future with those cutting edge technologies, we should believe that videoconferencing like Zoom can deliver a better experience than a face-to-face meeting. I shake hands with you remotely, you can feel my hand-shaking. And even if you speak a different language, with AI, with real-time language translation — I think those technologies can truly help make sure that online communication is better than face to face meeting. In the next 10 or 15 years, I think we will get there with some technology.</p><p><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/event/1X1beCKdopiVKzGA8MBlno\"><i>Watch the full interview</i></a></p><p><i>Quotes have been lightly edited for clarity and length.</i></p>",
