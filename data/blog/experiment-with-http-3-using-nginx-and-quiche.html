	<p>Just a few weeks ago <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future">we announced</a> the availability on our edge network of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3">HTTP/3</a>, the new revision of HTTP intended to improve security and performance on the Internet. Everyone can now enable HTTP/3 on their Cloudflare zone and experiment with it using <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/#using-google-chrome-as-an-http-3-client">Chrome Canary</a> as well as <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/#using-curl">curl</a>, among other clients.</p>
	<p>We have previously made available <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/examples/http3-server.rs">an example HTTP/3 server as part of the quiche project</a> to allow people to experiment with the protocol, but it’s quite limited in the functionality that it offers, and was never intended to replace other general-purpose web servers.</p>
	<p>We are now happy to announce that <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/enjoy-a-slice-of-quic-and-rust">our implementation of HTTP/3 and QUIC</a> can be integrated into your own installation of NGINX as well. This is made available <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/tree/master/extras/nginx">as a patch</a> to NGINX, that can be applied and built directly with the upstream NGINX codebase.</p>

	<p>It’s important to note that <b>this is not officially supported or endorsed by the NGINX project</b>, it is just something that we, Cloudflare, want to make available to the wider community to help push adoption of QUIC and HTTP/3.</p>

	<p>The first step is to <a href="https://nginx.org/en/download.html">download and unpack the NGINX source code</a>. Note that the HTTP/3 and QUIC patch only works with the 1.16.x release branch (the latest stable release being 1.16.1).</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"> % curl -O https://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.16.1.tar.gz
 % tar xvzf nginx-1.16.1.tar.gz</code></pre>
	<p>As well as quiche, the underlying implementation of HTTP/3 and QUIC:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"> % git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche</code></pre>
	<p>Next you’ll need to apply the patch to NGINX:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"> % cd nginx-1.16.1
 % patch -p01 &lt; ../quiche/extras/nginx/nginx-1.16.patch</code></pre>
	<p>And finally build NGINX with HTTP/3 support enabled:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"> % ./configure                          	\
   	--prefix=$PWD                       	\
   	--with-http_ssl_module              	\
   	--with-http_v2_module               	\
   	--with-http_v3_module               	\
   	--with-openssl=../quiche/deps/boringssl \
   	--with-quiche=../quiche
 % make</code></pre>
	<p>The above command instructs the NGINX build system to enable the HTTP/3 support ( <code>--with-http_v3_module</code>) by using the quiche library found in the path it was previously downloaded into ( <code>--with-quiche=../quiche</code>), as well as TLS and HTTP/2. Additional build options can be added as needed.</p>

	<p>Once built, NGINX can be configured to accept incoming HTTP/3 connections by adding the <code>quic</code> and <code>reuseport</code> options to the <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#listen">listen</a> configuration directive.</p>
	<p>Here is a minimal configuration example that you can start from:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    server {
        # Enable QUIC and HTTP/3.
        listen 443 quic reuseport;

        # Enable HTTP/2 (optional).
        listen 443 ssl http2;

        ssl_certificate      cert.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key  cert.key;

        # Enable all TLS versions (TLSv1.3 is required for QUIC).
        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
        
        # Add Alt-Svc header to negotiate HTTP/3.
        add_header alt-svc 'h3-23=":443"; ma=86400';
    }
}</code></pre>
	<p>This will enable both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 on the TCP/443 and UDP/443 ports respectively.</p>
	<p>You can then use one of the available HTTP/3 clients (such as <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/#using-google-chrome-as-an-http-3-client">Chrome Canary</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/#using-curl">curl</a> or even the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/#using-quiche-s-http3-client">example HTTP/3 client provided as part of quiche</a>) to connect to your NGINX instance using HTTP/3.</p>
	<p>We are excited to make this available for everyone to experiment and play with HTTP/3, but it’s important to note that <b>the implementation is still experimental</b> and it’s likely to have bugs as well as limitations in functionality. Feel free to submit a ticket to the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche">quiche project</a> if you run into problems or find any bug.</p>
