	<p>We like DNS, we think you might too.</p>
	<p>CloudFlare and Gandi are hosting a three-part series on DNS. Our first event will be at the CloudFlare office with Paul Mockapetris, the original inventor of the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt" target="_blank">Domain Name System</a>.</p>
	<p>Beyond inventing DNS, Paul built the first ever SMTP server. He ran networking at ARPA, served as the chair of the IETF, and is a honored member of the Internet Hall of Fame. He is currently the Chief Scientist at Threatstop, and the visiting scholar at the Universite de Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris.</p>
	<p>The event is on Tuesday, April 12th, 2016 at 6 PM PDT at our office in San Francisco, 101 Townsend Street (RSVP <a href="https://www.meetup.com/The-Root-Zone/" target="_blank">here</a>). We’ll be covering the early days of DNS, DNS and security, the commercialization of DNS (what Paul famously calls DN$), and the future of DNS.</p>
	<p>So come, grab some beer, and hang out with people who like DNS as much as you do.</p>
