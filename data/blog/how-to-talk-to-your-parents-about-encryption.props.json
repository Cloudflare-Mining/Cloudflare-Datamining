Let’s say they have some cash to deposit. They drive to their bank’s local branch, walk through a big fancy lobby, wait in line for a teller, and hand them their money. It may seem like a silly question, but how do they know they’re actually giving that cash to their bank and not some stranger off the street (or a very sophisticated con artist)?</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/jZ9dWuGiJas51LR0A5eBM/2da20f4b889db2bdc69a24dd05d1b4cb/bank-vault.jpg\" alt=\"Bank vault\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2256\" height=\"1496\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC By-SA 3.0</a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rdavout\">Rdavout</a></p><p>Put another way, how would they feel if they walked into their bank and it looked like a run-down bail bonds office? Even if they saw their bank’s logo hanging on the wall, they’d still probably be a little hesitant about handing over their money.</p><p>Traditional banks are in big fancy buildings for a reason. Big fancy buildings convey an innate sense of trust. You might think that it’s to invoke a reaction like, &quot;Oh my gosh, this bank has so much money they wouldn’t ever need to steal mine,&quot; but that’s not quite it. Big fancy buildings are trustworthy because they took a lot of time, money, and effort to construct, which means it would also take a lot of time, money, and effort for a con artist to build their own big fancy building and masquerade as your bank.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"encryption-is-the-internets-big-fancy-building\">Encryption Is the Internet’s Big Fancy Building</h3>\n      <a href=\"#encryption-is-the-internets-big-fancy-building\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>I use an online bank with no physical branches, so instead of walking into a lobby, I visit a website. The problem with (and beauty of) the Internet is that anybody can publish a website that looks just like my bank’s site for only a few bucks a month. How do I know that the website I’m visiting isn’t the digital equivalent of a run-down bail bonds office? Where’s my big fancy building?</p><p>Instead of gaining trust with a big fancy building, my online bank adds a TLS certificate to their website. TLS certificates use encryption to ensure that I’m actually visiting the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/\">domain name</a> I see in my browser and not a phishing website trying to steal my credentials.</p><p>That TLS certificate has the same key property as my parent’s physical bank building: it would take a lot of time and money for somebody to forge a certificate and impersonate my online bank. Even if a bad guy put up a website that looked exactly like my bank’s, they wouldn’t have a TLS certificate that matched, and my browser would warn me that something very bad is happening as soon as I visit the forged website.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-internet-is-more-complicated\">The Internet Is More Complicated</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-internet-is-more-complicated\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Of course, online financial transactions are a little different than at your local branch.

Now that they’re hooked, here are some tips you can feed them about how to stay safe online:</p><ul><li><p>Look for a lock icon in your browser and/or a URL that starts with https to ensure an encrypted connection before entering sensitive information like credit cards or passwords.</p></li><li><p>Double-check the domain name of the website before entering sensitive information to make sure you’re not on a phishing website like paypa1.com or g00gle.com.</p></li><li><p>Don’t text or email your credit cards, bank account numbers, or passwords, no matter how much you trust the person on the other end.</p><ul><li><p>To share this kind of information, use an encrypted file-sharing service like Dropbox or Box and password-protect any documents you share.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Use different, randomly generated passwords for each of your online accounts.</p><ul><li><p>If your Facebook password is stolen, at least they won’t be able to get into your Twitter or email account.</p></li><li><p>This makes a password manager like LastPass or 1Password a must for keeping track of all your credentials.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Use two-factor authentication anywhere that supports it, even if it’s slightly annoying.</p><ul><li><p>Two-factor authentication doesn’t let you login without access to your mobile phone, which makes it much harder for an attacker to hijack your account.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Don’t ignore your browser or operating system when it asks if you want to upgrade.</p><ul><li><p>It gets cheaper and cheaper to break older encryption protocols, and having an outdated system puts you at risk for attacks against outdated security protocols.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>The underlying theme behind all these best practices is the same. At some point along the way, there’s no encryption protecting your sensitive information, which means there’s a risk of a bad guy intercepting it.</p>",
