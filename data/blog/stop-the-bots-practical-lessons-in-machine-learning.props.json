Cloudflare already has an extensive array of tools which help inform this score, but in principle, we could manually label each datapoint as ‘bot’ or ‘not bot’, similar to the dentist example above.</p><p>One initial takeaway from our analysis was the geographical breakdown of attacks. Rudimentary bot-protection tools rely on blocking IP addresses from countries commonly associated with hostile traffic. But when we ranked the origin of bots across our network, it was obvious that this approach was untenable as most attacks originate from countries with huge volumes of legitimate traffic.

We used <a href=\"https://catboost.ai/\">CatBoost</a>, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting\">gradient boosting</a> library similar to XGBoost.</p><p><b>Validation</b>: Though we perform hundreds of independent validations tests, the ultimate validation is how many login attempts have been challenged with a Captcha, versus how many have solved a Captcha (a solved Captcha likely indicates a false positive).</p><p>Over the course of a week, we deployed our solution to 95 websites with WordPress login pages and found that we issued more than 660,000 challenges, of which only 0.32% were solved — meaning our algorithm detected bots with a 99.68% rate of True Positives.</p><p>While this work is just beginning, WordPress represents 32.5% of all websites worldwide, so this is a very meaningful step forward.

Today, it evaluates over 660 billion requests per day — learning and improving from each additional attack observed on the network.</p><p>But it wasn’t long before we found ourselves asking: is knowing and stopping credential stuffing attacks in real-time enough? Can we do more?</p><p>We used our existing data and began thinking of how to develop an algorithm to predict which companies will be attacked next. This would allow us to proactively warn companies before an attack occurs and prepare them for the worst case scenario, even if they aren’t currently on Cloudflare’s network.</p><p><b>Training</b>: We trained our Machine Learning Model with firmographic information like industry type, number of employees, and the revenue amount to predict the percentage of login attacks.</p><p><b>Results</b>: Amongst the many interesting findings is that smaller companies have a higher fraction of attacks. Intuitively, this makes sense because the opportunistic attack traffic scanning the Internet is equal on all pages while the human traffic on popular sites outweighs the bot attacks. Thus even though small companies represent a smaller traffic volume, they&#39;re the most vulnerable to attack.</p><p>Do these findings only affect the 13 million Cloudflare websites with 2.8 billion visitors across 237 countries that we had in our model? Likely not. That means Cloudflare can begin thinking about helping all companies by proactively anticipating attacks based on their unique risk profile.</p><p>Machine learning has been crucial to the development of our next generation of products, and we’ve only scratched the surface. We hope that this post is useful as you map out the trajectory of ML in your own organization: your road will be different, but hopefully you will see some familiar milestones along the way.</p><p>Cloudflare is actively developing its machine learning capabilities — if you’re interested in joining us or partnering with us on our mission please get in touch.</p>",
