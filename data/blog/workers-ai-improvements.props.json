Managing a distributed inference platform is not a simple task, but distributed systems are also what we do best. You’ll notice a recurring theme from all these announcements that has always been part of the core Cloudflare ethos — we try to solve problems through clever engineering so that we are able to do more with less.</p><p>Today, we’re excited to introduce speculative decoding to bring you faster inference, an asynchronous batch API for large workloads, and expanded LoRA support for more customized responses. Lastly, we’ll be recapping some of our newly added models, updated pricing, and unveiling a new dashboard to round out the usability of the platform.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"speeding-up-inference-by-2-4x-with-speculative-decoding-and-more\">Speeding up inference by 2-4x with speculative decoding and more</h2>\n      <a href=\"#speeding-up-inference-by-2-4x-with-speculative-decoding-and-more\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We’re excited to roll out speed improvements to models in our catalog, starting with the Llama 3.3 70b model.

Typically, an LLM is able to predict a single future token (n+1) with one forward pass through the model. These forward passes can be computationally expensive, since they need to work through all the parameters of a model to generate one token (e.g., 70 billion parameters for Llama 3.3 70b).</p><p>With speculative decoding, we put a small model (known as the draft model) in front of the original model that helps predict n+x future tokens. The draft model generates a subset of candidate tokens, and the original model just has to evaluate and confirm if they should be incorporated into the generation. Evaluating tokens is less computationally expensive, as the model can evaluate multiple tokens concurrently in a forward pass. As such, inference times can be sped up by 2-4x — meaning that users can get responses much faster.</p><p>What makes speculative decoding particularly efficient is that it’s able to use unused GPU compute left behind due to the GPU memory bottleneck LLMs create. Speculative decoding takes advantage of the unused compute by squeezing in a draft model to generate tokens faster. This means we’re able to improve the utilization of our GPUs by using them to their full extent without having parts of the GPU sit idle.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"what-is-prefix-caching\">What is prefix caching?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#what-is-prefix-caching\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>With LLMs, there are usually two stages of generation – the first is known as “pre-fill”, which processes the user’s input tokens such as the prompt and context. Prefix caching is aimed at reducing the pre-fill time of a request. As an example, if you were asking a model to generate code based on a given file, you might insert the whole file into the context window of a request. Then, if you want to make a second request to generate the next line of code, you might send us the whole file again in the second request. Prefix caching allows us to cache the pre-fill tokens so we don’t have to process the context twice. With the same example, we would only do the pre-fill stage once for both requests, rather than doing it per request. This method is especially useful for requests that reuse the same context, such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/\"><u>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</u></a>, code generation, chatbots with memory, and more. Skipping the pre-fill stage for similar requests means faster responses for our users and more efficient usage of resources. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-did-you-validate-that-quality-is-preserved-through-these-optimizations\">How did you validate that quality is preserved through these optimizations?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-did-you-validate-that-quality-is-preserved-through-these-optimizations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Since this is an in-place update to an existing model, we were particularly cautious in ensuring that we would not break any existing applications with this update.

Unfortunately, this is also one of the hardest use cases to manage capacity for as a serverless platform.</p><p>To illustrate this, imagine that you want to summarize a 70 page PDF. You typically chunk the document and then send an inference request for each chunk. If each chunk is a few paragraphs on a page, that means that we receive around 4 requests per page multiplied by 70 pages, which is about 280 requests. Multiply that by tens or hundreds of documents, and multiply that by a handful of concurrent users — this means that we get a sudden massive influx of thousands of requests when users start these large workloads.</p><p>The way we originally built Workers AI was to handle incoming requests as quickly as possible, assuming there&#39;s a human on the other side that needed an immediate response. The unique thing about batch workloads is that while they&#39;re not latency sensitive, they do require completeness guarantees — you don&#39;t want to come back the next day to realize none of your inference requests actually executed.</p><p>With the async API, you send us a batch of requests, and we promise to fulfill them as fast as possible and return them to you as a batch. This guarantees that your inference request will be fulfilled, rather than immediately (or eventually) erroring out. The async API also benefits users who have real-time use cases, as the model instances won’t be immediately consumed by these batch requests that can wait for a response. Inference times will be faster since there won’t be a bunch of competing requests in a queue waiting to reach the inference servers. </p><p>We have select models that support batch inference today, which include:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast/\"><u>@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast</u></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/bge-small-en-v1.5\"><u>@cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5</u></a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/bge-base-en-v1.5\"><u>@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5</u></a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/bge-large-en-v1.5\"><u>@cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5</u></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/bge-m3/\"><u>@cf/baai/bge-m3</u></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/m2m100-1.2b/\"><u>@cf/meta/m2m100-1.2b</u></a></p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"how-can-i-use-the-batch-api\">How can I use the batch API?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#how-can-i-use-the-batch-api\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Users can send a batch request to supported models by passing a flag:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-JavaScript\"><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">let res = await env.AI.run(&quot;@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-batch&quot;, {\n  &quot;requests&quot;: [{\n    &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;Explain mechanics of wormholes&quot;\n  }, {\n    &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;List different plant species found in America&quot;\n  }]\n}, {\n  queueRequest: true\n});</pre></code>\n            <p>Check out our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/batch-api/\"><u>developer docs</u></a> to learn more about the batch API, or use our <a href=\"https://github.com/craigsdennis/batch-please-workers-ai\"><u>template</u></a> to deploy a worker that implements the batch API.</p><p>Today, our batch API can be used by sending us an array of requests, and we’ll return your responses in an array.  This is helpful for use cases like summarizing large amounts of data that you know beforehand.

LoRA adapters are great alternatives to fine-tuning a model, as it isn’t as expensive to train and adapters are much smaller and more portable.
