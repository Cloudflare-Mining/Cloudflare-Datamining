This report includes insights and trends about the DDoS threat landscape - as observed across Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">global network</a>.</p><p>Multi-terabit strong DDoS attacks have become increasingly frequent. In Q3, Cloudflare automatically detected and mitigated multiple attacks that exceeded 1 Tbps. The largest attack was a 2.5 Tbps DDoS attack launched by a Mirai botnet variant, aimed at the Minecraft server, Wynncraft, that uses <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-spectrum/\">Cloudflare Spectrum</a>, a reverse-proxy for TCP/UDP applications. This is the largest attack we’ve ever seen from the bitrate perspective.</p><p>It was a multi-vector attack consisting of UDP and TCP floods. However, Wynncraft, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game\">massively multiplayer online role-playing game</a> Minecraft server where hundreds and thousands of users can play on the same server, didn’t even notice the attack, since Cloudflare filtered it out for them.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3TCFRo50VkVGAcKUdzVzYA/8c155dac69947d43ce326222089d3444/1.png\" alt=\"A graph of the 2.5 Tbps DDoS attack that targeted Wynncraft\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"827\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The 2.5 Tbps DDoS attack that targeted Wynncraft — launched by Mirai</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"general-ddos-attack-trends\">General DDoS attack trends</h2>\n      <a href=\"#general-ddos-attack-trends\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Overall this quarter, we&#39;ve seen:</p><ul><li><p>An increase in DDoS attacks compared to last year.</p></li><li><p>Longer-lasting volumetric attacks, a spike in attacks generated by the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/\">Mirai botnet</a> and its variants.</p></li><li><p>Surges in attacks targeting Taiwan and Japan.</p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"application-layer-ddos-attacks\">Application-layer DDoS attacks</h2>\n      <a href=\"#application-layer-ddos-attacks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <ul><li><p>HTTP DDoS attacks increased by 111% YoY, but decreased by 10% QoQ.</p></li><li><p>HTTP DDoS attacks targeting Taiwan increased by 200% QoQ; attacks targeting Japan increased by 105% QoQ.</p></li><li><p>Reports of Ransom DDoS attacks increased by 67% YoY and 15% QoQ.</p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"network-layer-ddos-attacks\">Network-layer DDoS attacks</h2>\n      <a href=\"#network-layer-ddos-attacks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <ul><li><p>L3/4 DDoS attacks increased by 97% YoY and 24% QoQ.</p></li><li><p>L3/4 DDoS attacks by Mirai botnets increased by 405% QoQ.</p></li><li><p>The Gaming / Gambling industry was the most targeted by L3/4 DDoS attacks including a massive 2.5 Tbps DDoS attack.</p></li></ul><p>This report is based on DDoS attacks that were automatically detected and mitigated by Cloudflare&#39;s DDoS Protection systems.

Each DDoS&#39;d customer is prompted with an automated survey to help us better understand the nature of the attack and the success of the mitigation. For over two years, Cloudflare has been surveying attacked customers. One of the questions in the survey asks the respondents if they received a threat or a ransom note demanding payment in exchange to stop the DDoS attack. Over the past year, on average, we collected 174 responses per quarter. The responses of this survey are used to calculate the percentage of Ransom DDoS attacks.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"application-layer-ddos-attacks\">Application-layer DDoS attacks</h2>\n      <a href=\"#application-layer-ddos-attacks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/application-layer-ddos-attack/\">Application-layer DDoS attacks</a>, specifically HTTP DDoS attacks, are attacks that usually aim to disrupt a web server by making it unable to process legitimate user requests.

Over the past two quarters, Broadcasting, Online Media and Publishing companies were targeted the most in what appeared to be an attempt to silence information and make it unavailable to civilians. However, this quarter, those industries dropped out of the top 10 list. Instead, the Marketing &amp; Advertising industry took the lead (40%), followed by Education companies (20%), and Government Administration (8%).</p><p><b>In Russia</b>, attacks on the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) industry continue to persist (25%). Be that as it may, attacks on the BFSI sector still decreased by 44% QoQ. In second place is the Events Services industry (20%), followed by Cryptocurrency (16%), Broadcast Media (13%), and Retail (11%). A significant portion of the attack traffic came from Germany-based IP addresses, and the rest were globally distributed.</p><p><b>In Taiwan,</b> the two most attacked industries were Online Media (50%) and Internet (23%). Attacks to those industries were globally distributed indicating the usage of botnets.</p><p><b>In Japan,</b> the most attacked industry was Internet/Media &amp; Internet (52%), Business Services (12%), and Government - National (11%).</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"application-layer-ddos-attack-traffic-by-source-country\">Application-layer DDoS attack traffic by source country</h3>\n      <a href=\"#application-layer-ddos-attack-traffic-by-source-country\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Before digging into specific source country metrics, it is important to note that while country of origin is interesting, it is not necessarily indicative of where the attacker is located. Oftentimes with DDoS attacks, they are launched remotely, and attackers will go to great lengths to hide their actual location in an attempt to avoid being caught. If anything, it is indicative of where botnet nodes are located. With that being said, by mapping the attacking IP address to their location, we can understand where attack traffic is coming from.</p><p>After two consecutive quarters, China replaced the US as the main source of HTTP DDoS attack traffic. In Q3, China was the largest source of HTTP DDoS attack traffic. Attack traffic from China-registered IP addresses increased by 29% YoY and 19% QoQ. Following China was India as the second-largest source of HTTP DDoS attack traffic — an increase of 61% YoY. After India, the main sources were the US and Brazil.</p><p>Looking at Ukraine, we can see that this quarter there was a drop in attack traffic originating from Ukrainian and Russian IP addresses — a decrease of 29% and 11% QoQ, respectively. However, YoY, attack traffic from within those countries still increased by 47% and 18%, respectively.</p><p>Another interesting data point is that attack traffic originating from Japanese IP addresses increased by 130% YoY.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7ihLfGt1e1B1cQMawFy1Yc/42dc81e462d9536625a0aac48ae15ad1/9.png\" alt=\"Graph of the top source countries of HTTP DDoS attacks in 2022 Q3\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Top source countries of HTTP DDoS attacks in 2022 Q3</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"network-layer-ddos-attacks\">Network-layer DDoS attacks</h2>\n      <a href=\"#network-layer-ddos-attacks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>While application-layer attacks target the application (Layer 7 of the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/\">OSI model</a>) running the service that end users are trying to access (HTTP/S in our case), <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/layer-3-ddos-attacks/\">network-layer attacks</a> aim to overwhelm network infrastructure (such as in-line routers and servers) and the Internet link itself.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2oVTzylydZrIo6F7vuPbTu/2f42818e1d25e7ac8eb59f1ddff01a13/10.png\" alt=\"Diagram of a L3/4 DDoS attack\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"842\" height=\"516\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"network-layer-ddos-attack-trends\">Network-layer DDoS attack trends</h3>\n      <a href=\"#network-layer-ddos-attack-trends\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In Q3, we saw a large surge in L3/4 DDoS attacks — an increase of 97% YoY and a 24% QoQ.

While the growth in Memcached DDoS attacks also slightly grew (48%), this quarter, there was a more dramatic increase in attacks abusing the BitTorrent protocol (1,221%), as well as attacks launched by the Mirai botnet and its variants.</p><p><b>BitTorrent DDoS attacks increased by 1,221% QoQ</b>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent\">BitTorrent protocol</a> is a communication protocol that’s used for peer to peer file sharing. To help the BitTorrent clients find and download the files efficiently, BitTorrent clients may use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker\">BitTorrent Trackers</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table\">Distributed Hash Tables (DHT)</a> to identify the peers that are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_BitTorrent_terms#Seed_/_seeding\">seeding</a> the desired file. This concept can be abused to launch DDoS attacks. A malicious actor can <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing/\">spoof</a> the victim’s IP address as a seeder IP address within Trackers and DHT systems. Then clients would request the files from those IPs. Given a sufficient number of clients requesting the file, it can flood the victim with more traffic than it can handle.</p><p><b>Mirai DDoS attacks increased by 405% QoQ</b><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/\">Mirai</a> is <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/malware/\">malware</a> that infects smart devices that run on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC_(processor)\">ARC processors</a>, turning them into a network of bots that can be used to launch DDoS attacks. This processor runs a stripped-down version of the Linux operating system. If the default username-and-password combo is not changed, Mirai is able to log in to the device, infect it, and take over. The botnet operator can instruct the botnet to launch a flood of UDP packets at the victim’s IP address to bombard them.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6qWtJr9lH7oxal8kUrGfoG/e26e089e6fdc5be9fc3ed038587fe3bc/22.png\" alt=\"A graph of the top emerging threats in 2022 Q3\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Top emerging threats in 2022 Q3</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"network-layer-ddos-attacks-by-attack-rates-duration\">Network-layer DDoS attacks by Attack Rates &amp; Duration</h3>\n      <a href=\"#network-layer-ddos-attacks-by-attack-rates-duration\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>While Terabit-strong attacks are becoming more frequent, they are still the outliers. The majority of attacks are tiny (in terms of Cloudflare scale). Over 95% of attacks peaked below 50,000 packets per second (pps) and over 97% below 500 Megabits per second (Mbps). We call this “cyber vandalism”.</p><p>What is cyber vandalism? As opposed to “classic” vandalism where the purpose is to cause deliberate destruction of or damage to public or private <i>physical</i> property — such as graffiti on the side of a building — in the cyberworld, cyber vandalism is the act of causing deliberate damage to Internet properties. Today the source codes for various botnets are available online and there are a number of free tools that can be used to launch a flood of packets. By directing those tools to Internet properties, any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie\"><i>script-kid</i></a> can use those tools to launch attacks against their school during exam season or any other website they desire to take down or disrupt. This is as opposed to organized crime, <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Persistent_Threat\">Advanced Persistent Threat</a> actors, and state-level actors that can launch much larger and sophisticated attacks.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4vPLRHd9pyptNQ01znsL3i/2de83530e156717fc9c908fd9a7b39e5/18.png\" alt=\"A graph of the distribution of DDoS attacks by bitrate in 2022 Q3\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Distribution of DDoS attacks by bitrate in 2022 Q3</p><p>Similarly, most of the attacks are very short and end within 20 minutes (94%).
