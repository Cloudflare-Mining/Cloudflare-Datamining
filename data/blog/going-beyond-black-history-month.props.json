We have highlighted a few notable organizations below.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.blackgirlscode.com/\">Black Girls Code</a>, founded in April 2011, focuses on teaching young African-American girls how to code in several programming languages. They hope to “bridge the digital divide” in a society that pits underrepresented, young, aspiring, girls against more privileged individuals. They aim to “provide African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. by 2020, and to train 1 million girls by 2040.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.devcolor.org/\">/dev/color</a> is a non-profit foundation led by supporters of inclusion in the tech industry with a mission to “empower Black software engineers to help one another grow into industry leaders.” /dev/color does this by focusing on helping individuals find new jobs, assist with start-ups, and most importantly, ensure that engineers find a sense of purpose in their careers and in tech.</p><p><a href=\"https://projectinclude.org/\">Project Include</a> uses data and advocacy to push diversity and inclusion initiatives in high tech. They work with companies to implement diversity initiatives that focus on three core concepts: inclusion, comprehensiveness, and accountability. Project Include shares a powerful message about what it takes to ‘walk the talk’ when it comes to diversity:</p><blockquote><p>“Change is hard, especially around a multidimensional issue like diversity. It is easy for all of us to become defensive and emotional, to shift the blame to others, and to feel fundamentally unheard or misunderstood. It is so uncomfortable for us to talk about the diversity problem that we have not been able to acknowledge it in full.”</p></blockquote><p>These are a few of the many tech events and organizations working to solve this problem. However, doing this work takes more than just money. It involves having difficult conversations, training employees on ally skills, and supporting ERGs to <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/afroflare-presents-black-history-month-mixer-tickets-93196730931\">celebrate</a> and educate tech companies on different experiences, which is what we do here at Cloudflare.</p><p>As Cloudflarians, we come to work every day to build a better Internet. As Afroflarians, we want to acknowledge the current industry problems around inclusion and work tirelessly to build a better tech industry that welcomes and supports everyone. Not just during Black History Month, but always.</p><p>We urge you to do the same.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2sRh3WzzXEdehEdLswYgGk/de5eebc47e7f12e7f3f90dc2571bf47d/image2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Afroflare at Afrotech in Oakland (November 2019)</i></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2czAAh0qlnxOlvEzNq4wm8/59c25f14543f6551335a20ac1676ee8c/image1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Afroflare at Afrotech in Oakland (November 2019)</i></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6nakqC1TdxFUMM0FpajNrh/15b93f30b06fdf48143be338ca3a9aa6/image3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>Afroflare at Afrotech in Oakland (November 2019)</i></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5mefOAbHE5r0qAf2STfRHo/55e0a6152029e86a8d7fafbafd8d0880/Afroflare-logo.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1066\" height=\"494\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>",
