	<p>So the story begins with a pair programming session I had with my colleague, which I desperately needed because my node skill tree is still at level 1, and I needed to get started with React because I'll be working on our internal <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage"><u>backstage</u></a> instance.</p>
	<p>We worked together on a small feature, tested it locally, and it worked. Great. Now it's time to make My Very First React Commit. So I ran the usual <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code>, which hooked into <code>yarn test</code>, to automatically run unit tests for backstage, and that's when <i>everything got derailed</i>. For all the React tutorials I have followed, I have never actually run a <code>yarn test</code> on <i>my machine</i>. And the first time I tried yarn test, it hung, and after a long time, the command eventually failed:</p>

	<p>I could tell it was obviously unhappy about something, and then it threw some [Error]. I have very little actual JavaScript experience, but this looks suspiciously like someone had neglected to write a proper toString() or whatever, and thus we're stuck with the monumentally unhelpful [Error]. Searching the web yielded an entire ocean of false positives due to how vague the error message is. <i>What a train wreck!</i></p>
	<p>Fine, let's put on our troubleshooting hats. My memory is not perfect, but thankfully shell history is. Let's see all the (ultimately useless) things that were tried (with commentary):</p>

	<p>The first real breakthrough was <code>test plugins</code>,&nbsp;which runs only tests matching "plugins". This effectively bypassed the "determining suites to run..." logic, which was the thing that was hanging. So, I am now able to get tests to run. However, these too eventually crash with the same cryptic <code>[Error]</code>:</p>

	<p>Re-running it or matching different tests will give slightly different run logs, but they always end with the same error.</p>
	<p>By now, I've figured out that yarn test is actually backed by <a href="https://jestjs.io"><u>Jest, a JavaScript testing framework</u></a>, so my next strategy is simply trying different Jest flags to see what sticks, but invariably, none do:</p>

	<p>Eventually, after re-running it so many times, I started to notice a pattern. So by default after a test run, Jest drops you into an interactive menu where you can&nbsp; (Q)uit, Run (A)ll tests, etc. and I realized that Jest would eventually crash, even if it's idling in the menu. I started timing the runs, which led me to the second breakthrough:</p>

	<p>No matter what Jest was doing, it always crashes after almost exactly 27 wallclock seconds. It literally didn't matter what tests I selected or re-ran. Even the original problem, a bare yarn test (no tests selected, just hangs), will crash after 27 seconds:</p>

	<p>Obviously, some sort of timeout. 27 seconds is kind of a weird number (unlike, say, 5 seconds or 60 seconds) but let's try:</p>
	<pre class="language-Rust"><code class="language-Rust">2025-03-19 15:09  find | fgrep 27
2025-03-19 15:09  git grep '\b27\b'
</code></pre>
	<p>No decent hits.</p>
	<p>How about something like 20+7 or even 20+5+2? <i>Nope.</i></p>
	<p>Googling/GPT-4oing&nbsp; for "jest timeout 27 seconds" again yielded nothing useful. Far more people were having problems with testing asynchronously, or getting their tests to timeout, than with Jest proper.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>At this time, my colleague came back from his call, and with his help we determined some other things:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>his system (MacOS) is not affected at all versus mine (Linux)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#intro"><u>nvm use v20</u></a> didn't fix it</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>I can reproduce it on a clean clone of <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage"><u>github.com/backstage/backstage</u></a>. The tests seem to progress further, about 50+ seconds. This lends credence to a running theory that the filesystem crawler/watcher is the one crashing, and backstage/backstage is a bigger repo than the internal Cloudflare instance, so it takes longer.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I next went <i>on a little detour</i> to grab another colleague who I know has been working on a <a href="https://nextjs.org"><u>Next.js</u></a> project. He's one of the few other people nearby who knows anything about <a href="https://nodejs.org/en"><u>Node.js</u></a>. In my experience with troubleshooting it’s helpful to get multiple perspectives, so we can cover each other’s blind spots and avoid tunnel vision.</p>
	<p>I then tried invoking many yarn tests in parallel, and I did manage to get the crash time to stretch out to 28 or 29 seconds if the system was under heavy load. So this tells me that it might not be a hard timeout but rather processing driven. A series of sleeps <i>chugging along</i> perhaps?</p>
	<p>By now, there is a veritable crowd of curious onlookers gathered in front of my terminal marveling at the consistent 27 seconds crash and trading theories. At some point, someone asked if I had tried rebooting yet, and I had to sheepishly reply that I haven't but "I'm absolutely sure it wouldn't help whatsoever".</p>
	<p>And the astute reader can already guess that rebooting did nothing at all, or else this wouldn't even be a story worth telling. Besides, haven't I teased in the clickbaity title about some crazy Steam Locomotive from 1993?</p>

	<p>I don't know about you, but sometimes I look at straces and wonder “Do people actually read this gibberish?” Fortunately, in the modern generative AI era, we can count on GPT-4o to gently chide: the process was interrupted <code>EINTR</code> by its child <code>SIGCHLD</code>, which means you forgot about the children, silly human. Is the problem with <i>one of the cars rather than the engine</i>?</p>
	<p>Following this <i>train of thought</i>, I now re-ran with <code>strace --follow-forks</code>, which revealed a giant flurry of activity that promptly overflowed my terminal buffer. The investigation is really <i>gaining steam</i> now. The original trace weighs in at a hefty 500,000 lines, but here is a smaller equivalent version derived from a clean instance of backstage: <a href="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3IX3GEpe1WPllLf4tJBw5l/9a6c00a3eb06693d545ca49834ded987/trace.log.gz"><u>trace.log.gz</u></a>. I have uploaded this trace here because the by-now overhyped Steam Locomotive is finally making its grand appearance<b> </b>and I know there'll be people who'd love nothing more than to crawl through a haystack of system calls looking for a train-sized needle. Consider yourself lucky, I had to do it without even knowing what I was looking for, much less that it was a whole Steam Locomotive.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>This section is left intentionally blank to allow locomotive enthusiasts who want to find the train on their own to do so first.</p>

	<p>Remember my comment about straces being gibberish? Actually, I was kidding. So there are a few ways to make it more manageable, and with experience you'll learn which system calls to pay attention to, such as <code>execve</code>,<code> chdir</code>,<code> open</code>,<code> read</code>,<code> fork</code>,<code> and signals</code>, and which ones to skim over, such as <code>mprotect,</code> <code>mmap</code>, and <code>futex</code>.</p>

	<p>When I first saw that Jest was running <code>sl</code> so many times, my first thought was to ask my colleague if <code>sl</code> is a valid command on his Mac, and of course it is not. After all, which serious engineer would stuff their machine full of silly commands like <code>sl</code>, <a href="https://r-wos.org/hacks/gti"><code><u>gti</u></code></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay"><code><u>cowsay</u></code></a>, or <a href="https://linuxcommandlibrary.com/man/toilet"><code><u>toilet</u></code></a> ? The next thing I tried was to rename <code>sl</code> to something else, and sure enough all my problems disappeared: <code>yarn test</code> started working perfectly.</p>

	<p>I don't know. Actually I'm not sure if a forked child executing <code>sl</code> still has a terminal anymore, but the travel time of the train does depend on the terminal width. The wider it is, the longer it takes:</p>
	<pre class="language-Rust"><code class="language-Rust">🌈  ~  tput cols
425
🌈  ~  time sl
sl  0.19s user 0.06s system 1% cpu 20.629 total
🌈  ~  tput cols

🌈  ~  time sl  
sl  0.03s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 5.695 total</code></pre>
	<p>So the first thing I tried was to run yarn test in a ridiculously narrow terminal and see what happens:</p>
	<pre class="language-Rust"><code class="language-Rust">Determin

	<p>Alas, the terminal width doesn't affect jest at all. Jest calls<a href="https://github.com/jestjs/jest/pull/13941/files#diff-4c649a2515ae8d1dc1ed6ebccbe3b43e54e5d7217cb011df616dcf471a80319cR59"> <code><u>sl via execa</u></code></a> so let's mock that up locally:</p>
	<pre class="language-Rust"><code class="language-Rust">🌈  choochoo  cat runSl.mjs 
import {execa} from 'execa';
const { stdout } = await execa('tput', ['cols']);
console.log('terminal colwidth:', stdout);
await execa('sl', ['root']);
🌈  choochoo  time node runSl.mjs
terminal colwidth: 80
node runSl.mjs  0.21s user 0.06s system 4% cpu 6.730 total</code></pre>
	<p>So <code>execa</code> uses the default terminal width of 80, which takes the train 6.7 seconds to cross. And 27 seconds divided by 6.7 is awfully close to 4. So is Jest running <code>sl</code> 4 times? Let's do a poor man's <a href="https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace"><u>bpftrace</u></a> by hooking into <code>sl</code> like so:</p>
	<pre class="language-Rust"><code class="language-Rust">#!/bin/bash

uniqid=$RANDOM
echo "$(date --utc +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N") $uniqid started" &gt;&gt; /home/yew/executed.log
/usr/games/sl.actual "$@"
echo "$(date --utc +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N") $uniqid ended" &gt;&gt; /home/yew/executed.log</code></pre>
	<p>And if we check <code>executed.log</code>, <code>sl</code> is indeed executed in 4 waves, albeit by 5 workers simultaneously in each wave:</p>

	<p>Let's go back to the very start of our journey. The original <code>[Error]</code> thrown was actually<a href="https://github.com/jestjs/jest/pull/13941/files#diff-4c649a2515ae8d1dc1ed6ebccbe3b43e54e5d7217cb011df616dcf471a80319cR48"> <u>from here</u></a> and after modifying <code>node_modules/jest-changed-files/index.js</code>, I found that the error is <code>shortMessage: 'Command failed with ENAMETOOLONG: sl status...</code>'&nbsp; and the reason why became clear when I interrogated Jest about what it thinks the repos are.</p>
	<p>While the git repo is what you'd expect, the sl "repo" looks amazingly like a <i>train wreck in motion</i>:</p>
