		"html": "<p></p><p>Today, after more than 13 years at the company, I am joining Cloudflare’s board of directors and retiring from my full-time position as CTO. </p><p>Back in 2012 I wrote a short post on my personal site simply titled: <a href=\"https://blog.jgc.org/2012/02/programmer.html\"><u>Programmer</u></a>. The post announced that I’d recently joined a company called CloudFlare (still sporting that capital “F”) with the job title Programmer. I’d chosen that title in part because it was the very first title I’d ever had, and because it would reflect what I’d be doing at Cloudflare.</p><p>I had spent a lot of time working at startups—in technical and then management roles—and wanted to go back to the really technical part that I loved most. Cloudflare gave me that opportunity, and I worked on a lot of systems that make up the Cloudflare that so many people around the world use today.</p><p>Looking back on my time at the company it’s really, really hard to pick my top highlights. In 2019 <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/helping-to-build-cloudflare-part-1/\"><u>I wrote 6,000 words on the experience of helping build Cloudflare</u></a>. But here are five that stand out:</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"always-be-shipping\">Always be shipping</h3>\n            <a href=\"#always-be-shipping\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The night we finished the preparation to launch <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/\"><u>Universal SSL</u></a> sticks in my memory.

I remember Cloudflare’s third co-founder, Lee Holloway, hunched over his laptop finishing the code.

Curiosity and empathy are two core values at Cloudflare, and I am struck every week by how often we’re recognizing teams of people who are being thanked for helping with a sale, fixing a bug, responding to an incident, or helping build Cloudflare. That team spirit is part of what makes Cloudflare a special place to work.</p><p>One of the things I will miss about not being at Cloudflare day-to-day is the incredible strength of the individual team members.

We were 25 people and now, we’ve grown to more than 4,200 employees and 15 locations across the globe. As we grew I wore a lot of different hats. For a time I ran engineering, operations, security, and even IT. And, of course, I wrote for, and edited, the Cloudflare Blog for many, many years. Over time, we hired many great leaders to run those teams.</p><p>But the role that persisted was CTO. And today, we are announcing that, just as I gave up the title Programmer (and the programming that went along with it), I am giving up the title CTO (and the role’s responsibilities) for a new way to help Cloudflare grow and succeed, as a member of the board of directors.</p><p>Last year when I told Matthew that I planned to retire, I had not expected to be offered a seat on the company’s board. It’s an incredible and rare honour to go from being an employee of the company (albeit one who has been there from close to the beginning) to joining the board of directors. I am absolutely thrilled to be able to continue helping Cloudflare grow and succeed from a slightly different vantage point.</p><p>At the same time, Dane Knecht, who, until today, was SVP of Emerging Technology and Incubation, has become our CTO. Dane joined just a few months after me, and is uniquely positioned and experienced to take the CTO role. We’ve worked so closely for the last 13 years as peers, that in many meetings it would’ve been hard to distinguish our roles. I’m pretty sure that Dane bleeds Cloudflare orange, and I’ve never seen him wear a T-shirt that doesn’t say Cloudflare on it. He has been part of nearly every major milestone here at Cloudflare. He cares so deeply about the company, and its success; he will make a great CTO.</p><p>My plan isn’t to go off and work somewhere else, or start a new company. I intend to remain closely involved with Cloudflare in my role on the board. I am incredibly honoured, and grateful to have been part of Cloudflare’s incredible growth and success, and I am looking forward to helping the company continue its growth.</p><p>One area I’m particularly interested in assisting with is the company’s work across the product suite on AI. Back in 2002 (23 years ago! gulp!). I wrote a very popular open source machine learning (didn’t call it AI back then) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POPFile\"><u>email filtering program</u></a> and in 2004 worked on how to deal with what happens when <a href=\"https://blog.jgc.org/2023/07/how-to-beat-adaptivebayesian-spam.html\"><u>one AI system is used to attack another</u></a>. At Cloudflare, we’ve used learning techniques to enhance security, block bots, and predict how our systems should behave and grow. There’s much more to do.</p><p>Just as co-founder <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/author/michelle-zatlyn/\"><u>Michelle</u></a> likes to say: we’re just getting started. And so am I.</p>",
