In this blog post, we will look at the security events we observed between the 23 April 2019 and 23 May 2019.</p><p>Project Galileo sites are protected by the Cloudflare Firewall and Advanced DDoS Protection which contain a number of features that can be used to detect and mitigate different types of attack and suspicious traffic.

The WAF is available to all of our paying customers, protecting them against 0-days, SQL/XSS exploits and more. For the Project Galileo customers the WAF rules blocked more than <b>4.5</b> million requests in the month that we looked at, matching over 130 WAF rules and approximately 150k requests per day.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/xeVZ4bwsq4aySUxpIdXkU/d97be07840a080be16f7cf6a8e65135c/AJxk6op83jW6A3LcLLhGJaGFaVpCsBd4ty_K_QhFcnW0_FKXEkJYV6bbIvg7DL-yOtWIfmvlEVChFTmGh8IMjywqn2adoBwb8fmY6-Birvpx43kAgzsjwqx2YmAX.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1147\" height=\"1184\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Heat map showing the attacks seen on customer sites (rows) per day (columns)</p><p>This heat map may initially appear confusing but reading one is easy once you know what to expect so bear with us! It is a table where each line is a website on Project Galileo and each column is a day. The color represents the number of requests triggering WAF rules - on a scale from 0 (white) to a lot (dark red). The darker the cell, the more requests were blocked on this day.</p><p>We observe malicious traffic on a daily basis for most websites we protect. The average Project Galileo site saw malicious traffic for 27 days in the 1 month observed, and for almost 60% of the sites we noticed daily events.</p><p>Fortunately, the vast majority of websites only receive a few malicious requests per day, likely from automated scanners. In some cases, we notice a net increase in attacks against some websites - and a few websites are under a constant influx of attacks.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3jspr63m1ZPzhccip8JViU/2d3bdf2c382b12ecf60bb107079a0fb3/KaFgtLheT89hQ073frYp-5DBiBPAESZ93t6FIPYz8t0oo02omlH8sugpKIGJA847c8jh2O0iErKU61Vuf06IAeCNQWn8TT-eETZu-SkgIYCl98GtxVCEqC0hIPWf.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1147\" height=\"1184\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Heat map showing the attacks blocked for each WAF rule (rows) per day (columns)</p><p>This heat map shows the WAF rules that blocked requests by day. At first, it seems some rules are useless as they never match malicious requests, but this plot makes it obvious that some attack vectors become active all of a sudden (isolated dark cells). This is especially true for 0-days, malicious traffic starts once an exploit is published and is very active on the first few days. The dark active lines are the most common malicious requests, and these WAF rules protect against things like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/how-to-prevent-xss-attacks/\">XSS</a> and SQL injection attacks.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"dos-denial-of-service\">DoS (Denial of Service)</h3>\n      <a href=\"#dos-denial-of-service\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>A <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-mitigation/\"><b>DoS</b></a> attack prevents legitimate visitors from accessing a website by flooding it with bad traffic.  Due to the way Cloudflare works, websites protected by Cloudflare are immune to many DoS vectors, out of the box.

Customers can easily implement complex logic using Firewall Rules to filter out specific chunks of traffic, block IPs / Networks / Countries using Access Rules and Project Galileo sites have done just that. Let’s see a few examples.</p><p><a href=\"/announcing-firewall-rules/\"><b>Firewall Rules</b></a> allows website owners to challenge or block as much or as little traffic as they desire, and this can be done as a surgical tool “block just this request” or as a general tool “challenge every request”.</p><p>For instance, a well-known website used <b>Firewall Rules</b> to prevent twenty IPs from fetching specific pages. 3 of these IPs were then used to send a total of 4.5 million requests over a short period of time, and the following chart shows the requests seen for this website. When this happened Cloudflare, mitigated the traffic ensuring that the website remains available.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1QX05tYEJtJONlXhXLT4Rd/0b481c7b58a8101bd588801ab96b6b7f/vO5ctEREt3GkkAHbKc3YGsP52-1_G0BEFUgcjL7pvlYGwkjHv5xm5X6QI3yD84bBlArh7hjI-CI2qWZ-pU-DBsF0gBXBMjA0YcLfMVcc2gG__20xRKI86ObNvfjS.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"679\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Cumulative line plot. Requests per second to a website</p><p>Another website, built with WordPress, is using Cloudflare to cache their webpages. As POST requests are not cacheable, they always hit the origin machine and increase load on the origin server - that’s why this website is using firewall rules to block POST requests, except on their administration backend. Smart!</p><p>Website owners can also deny or challenge requests based on the visitor’s IP address, Autonomous System Number (ASN) or Country. Dubbed <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/217074967-Configuring-IP-Access-Rules\"><b>Access Rules</b></a>, it is enforced on all pages of a website - hassle-free.</p><p>For example, a news website is using Cloudflare’s Access Rules to challenge visitors from countries outside of their geographic region who are accessing their website. We enforce the rules globally even for cached resources, and take care of GeoIP database updates for them, so they don’t have to.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001595131-How-do-I-Lockdown-URLs-in-Cloudflare-\"><b>Zone Lockdown</b></a> utility restricts a specific URL to specific IP addresses. This is useful to protect an internal but public path being accessed by external IP addresses. A non-profit based in the United Kingdom is using Zone Lockdown to restrict access to their WordPress’ admin panel and login page, hardening their website without relying on non official plugins. Although it does not prevent very sophisticated attacks, it shields them against automated attacks and phishing attempts - as even if their credentials are stolen, they can’t be used as easily.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"rate-limiting\">Rate Limiting</h3>\n      <a href=\"#rate-limiting\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cloudflare acts as a CDN, caching resources and happily serving them, reducing bandwidth used by the origin server … and indirectly the costs.
