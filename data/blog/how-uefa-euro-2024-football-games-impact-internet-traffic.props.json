		"html": "<p></p><p>Football (“soccer” in the US) is considered the most popular sport in the world, with around <a href=\"https://sportsmonkie.com/most-popular-sports/\">3.5 billion fans</a> spread across the world. European football is central to its popularity. The <a href=\"https://www.uefa.com/euro2024/\">UEFA Euro 2024</a> (the European Football Championship) started on June 14 and will run until July 14, 2024. But how much do these games impact Internet traffic in countries where national teams are playing? That’s what we aim to explore in this blog post. We found that, on average, traffic dropped 6% during games in European countries with national teams playing in the tournament.</p><p>Cloudflare has a global presence with data centers in over 320 cities, which helps provide a global view of what’s happening on the Internet. This is helpful for security, privacy, efficiency, and speed purposes, but also for observing Internet <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center\">disruptions</a> and <a href=\"/tag/cloudflare-radar\">traffic trends</a>.</p><p>In the past, we’ve seen how Internet traffic and HTTP requests are impacted by events such as <a href=\"/total-eclipse-internet-traffic-impacts-mexico-us-canada\">total solar eclipses</a>, the <a href=\"/super-bowl-lvii\">Super Bowl</a>, and <a href=\"/tag/election-security\">elections</a>. 2024 is the year of elections, and we’ve been sharing our observations in <a href=\"/tag/election-security\">blog posts</a> and our new 2024 <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/elections-2024\">Election Insights report</a> on Cloudflare Radar.</p><p>However, football games are different from elections. Related trends happen when major teams or national squads are playing matches that draw a lot of human attention. If a game is broadcast on a national TV channel, Internet traffic typically drops because during games. People’s attention is more on the TV set with the ‘old’ broadcast signal, for those games that don’t require a paid subscription. That’s the most common situation when national teams are playing in Europe.</p><p>If it’s on a closed or paid channel (where a subscription is needed), then sometimes traffic increases as fewer viewers have access to the TV broadcast. For context, there’s a trend of channels offering games in their apps through streaming, not only for paid channels but also national broadcasters such as the British BBC. The opening England game in Euro 2024 on Sunday, June 16, 2024, had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2024/15-million-bbc-one-england-mens-euro-2024-opener\">15 million viewers on BBC</a> One and was also streamed 3.5 million times on BBC iPlayer. This variety of viewing options from a single service appears to be a new trend in the digital age.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"football-games-associated-with-drops-in-traffic\">Football games associated with drops in traffic</h2>\n      <a href=\"#football-games-associated-with-drops-in-traffic\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Now, for some game-related Internet trends: the Netherlands, Turkey, Belgium, Croatia, Slovakia, Serbia, and host Germany were the countries where their national team games had a significant impact on requests, with a drop of at least 12% compared to the previous week.
