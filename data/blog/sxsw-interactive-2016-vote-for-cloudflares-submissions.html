Fast forward and you have more employees, customers, commitments, internal silos, and business goals than ever before. How do you maintain the agile innovation pace you had early on? This panel of builders and visionaries will share how they stay laser focused on what’s over the horizon, avoiding incrementalism. They’ll share how they keep their teams paving the way for others to follow.</p>
