			Innovating is easy in the early days--especially without the legacy systems, prior customer commitments, or formal internal processes that come with time. Fast forward and you have more employees, customers, commitments, internal silos, and business goals than ever before. How do you maintain the agile innovation pace you had early on? This panel of builders and visionaries will share how they stay laser focused on what’s over the horizon, avoiding incrementalism. They’ll share how they keep their teams paving the way for others to follow.</li>

			Strong encryption is taking over the tech landscape, but it is facing a backlash. Some in government are calling it a threat to law and order and pressing companies to build backdoors for surveillance. Come hear a top developer of secure apps, a major Internet company's policy expert, a national tech business reporter and a longtime privacy advocate talk about what this new "Crypto War" means for the future of innovation, cybersecurity, the tech economy, and your business.</li>
