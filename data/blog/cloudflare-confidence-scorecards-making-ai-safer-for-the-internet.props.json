		"html": "<p>Security and IT teams face an impossible balancing act: Employees are adopting AI tools every day, but each tool carries unique risks tied to compliance, data privacy, and security practices. Employees using these tools without seeking prior approval leads to a new type of<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-shadow-it/\"><u> Shadow IT</u></a> which is referred to as <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/shadow-AI-analytics/\"><u>Shadow AI</u></a>. Preventing Shadow AI requires manually vetting each AI application to determine whether it should be approved or disapproved. This isn’t scalable. And blanket bans of AI applications will only drive AI usage deeper underground, making it harder to secure.</p><p>That’s why today we are launching Cloudflare Application Confidence Scorecards. This is part of our new suite of <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/best-practices-sase-for-ai/\"><u>AI Security</u></a> features within the Cloudflare One SASE platform. These scores bring scale and automation to the labor- and time-intensive task of evaluating generative AI and SaaS applications one by one. Instead of spending hours trying to find AI applications’ compliance certifications or data-handling practices, evaluators get a clear score that reflects an application’s safety and trustworthiness. With that signal, decision makers within organizations can confidently set policies or apply guardrails where needed, and block risky tools so their organizations can embrace innovation without compromising security.</p><p>Our Cloudflare Application Confidence Scorecards rate both AI-powered applications on a number of factors, including whether they’ve achieved industry-recognized certifications, follow certain data management and security measures, and the maturity level of the company. Meanwhile, amongst other considerations, our Generative AI confidence score awards higher scores to AI models that provide system cards that describe testing for bias, ethics, and safety considerations, and that do not train on user inputs.  We hope our emphasis on privacy, security, and safety helps drive safer and more secure AI for everyone.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6FQPYW5ZI0vPO950CBJ0Di/3bd6f05703f522c84608882f347f3585/generative-AI-confidence-score.png\" alt=\"Gen AI Confidence Scorecard\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1204\" height=\"989\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/opTtg2dkqMc7ZeUevjZjS/77bacb0c4a888622024c7a1b808d41a5/app-confidence-score.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1204\" height=\"994\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"rapid-increase-in-shadow-ai\">Rapid increase in Shadow AI</h2>\n      <a href=\"#rapid-increase-in-shadow-ai\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Over the last decade, SaaS adoption has reshaped how businesses work. Employees can now pick up a new tool in minutes with nothing more than a credit card or free trial link. Now with the growth of generative AI, entire workflows are moving outside corporate oversight. From writing assistants to image generators, employees are relying on these tools daily, without knowing whether they comply with corporate or regulatory requirements. </p><p>The risks of these tools are wide-ranging. Sensitive data can be stored or transmitted outside of company controls. Tools may lack certifications such as SOC2 or ISO 27001. Many providers retain user data indefinitely or use it to train external models. Others face financial or operational instability that could disrupt your business if they go bankrupt or suffer a breach. Models can produce biased outputs that can introduce compliance risks or lead to erroneous business decisions. Security leaders tell us they cannot keep up with auditing every new application.  </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"we-score-them-for-you-at-scale\">We score them for you, at scale</h2>\n      <a href=\"#we-score-them-for-you-at-scale\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In order to make this effective, we needed two things: a rubric that could judge AI and SaaS applications, and then a mechanism to scalably score all those applications.
