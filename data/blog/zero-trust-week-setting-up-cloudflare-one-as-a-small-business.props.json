But when it comes to network security and performance, the industry has focused all too often on the largest of customers with significant budgets and technology teams. At Cloudflare, we think it’s our opportunity and responsibility to serve everyone, and help companies of all sizes benefit from a better Internet.</p><p>This is Zero Trust Week at Cloudflare, and we’ve already talked about our mantra of <a href=\"/teams-plans/\">Zero Trust for Everyone</a>. As a quick refresher, Zero Trust is a security framework that assumes all networks, devices, and Internet destinations are inherently compromised and therefore should not be trusted. Cloudflare One facilitates <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust security</a> by securing how your users connect to corporate applications and the Internet at large.</p><p>As a small business network administrator, there are fundamentally three things you need to protect: devices, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/\">applications</a>, and the network itself. Below, I’ll outline how you can secure devices whether they are in your office (DNS Filtering) or remote (WARP+ and Gateway), as well as applications and your network by moving to a Zero Trust model of security (Access).</p><p>By design, Cloudflare One is accessible to teams of any size. You shouldn&#39;t need a massive IT department or a Fortune 500 budget to connect to your tools safely.  On Tuesday, we <a href=\"/teams-plans/\">announced</a> a new free plan which provides many of the features of Cloudflare One, including DNS filtering, Zero Trust access, and a management dashboard - for up to 50 users at no cost.</p><p>Starting now, your team can begin deploying Cloudflare One in your organization in just a few simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Protect offices from threats on the Internet with DNS Filtering (10 minutes)Step 2: <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/remote-workforces/\">Secure remote workers</a> connecting to the Internet with Cloudflare WARP+ (30 minutes)Step 3: Connect users to applications without a VPN with Cloudflare Access (1 hour)Step 4: Block threats and data loss on devices with a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/\">Secure Web Gateway</a> (1 hour)Step 5: Add Zero Trust to your SaaS applications (2 hours)</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"1-start-blocking-malicious-sites-and-phishing-attempts-in-10-minutes\">1.

Protecting employees from threats on the Internet requires a way to inspect and filter their traffic. That starts with DNS-level filtering that can quickly and easily eliminate known malicious sites as well as restrict access to potentially dangerous neighborhoods on the Internet.</p><p>When your devices connect to a website, they start by sending a DNS query to a DNS resolver to find the IP address of the hostname for that site. The resolver responds and the device initiates the connection. That initial query creates two challenges for your team’s security:</p><ul><li><p>Most DNS queries are unencrypted. ISPs can spy on DNS queries made by your employees and corporate devices while they work from home. Even worse, a malicious actor could modify responses to launch an attack.</p></li><li><p>DNS queries can resolve to malicious hostnames. Team members can click on links that lead to phishing attacks or malware downloads.</p></li></ul><p>Cloudflare One can help keep that first query private and stop devices from inadvertently requesting a known malicious hostname.</p><p>Start by signing up for a Cloudflare account and navigating to the Cloudflare for <a href=\"https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/\">Teams dashboard</a>.</p><p>Next, set up a location.  You’ll be <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/gateway/getting-started-new/onboarding-gateway/\">prompted to create a location</a> which you can do if you want to protect the DNS queries of an office network. Simply deploy Gateway’s DNS filtering for your office by changing your network’s router to point to the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/initial-setup/dns/\">assigned</a> Gateway IP address.</p><p>Cloudflare operates 1.1.1.1, the world’s fastest DNS resolver. We’ve built Cloudflare Gateway’s DNS filtering tools on top of that same architecture so that your team has faster and safer DNS.</p><p>Now you can easily create a Gateway DNS policy to filter security threats or specific content categories.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5vLj4IIfQn3zuDb4TazzQK/ee973f177a7a208cc16ff9d51f14a1b3/image9-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1224\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Then use the Gateway dashboard to monitor queries that are allowed or blocked.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1evMsuFgNEJEI7Yj41LdFV/d16b02eacd523b9a5518c7a738e9bb67/image5-8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1228\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Then navigate to the dashboard on the “Overview” tab and see your traffic including what you are blocking and allowing.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4Lhs7rdm16nhZ9W56zsCOE/f394c36c88a5142605e6d37dd8dca3d4/image2-16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1092\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"2-next-protect-all-of-your-remote-employees-and-send-all-traffic-through-cloudflare-over-an-encrypted-connection\">2.Next, protect all of your remote employees and send all traffic through Cloudflare over an encrypted connection</h3>\n      <a href=\"#2-next-protect-all-of-your-remote-employees-and-send-all-traffic-through-cloudflare-over-an-encrypted-connection\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Employees who used to connect to the Internet through your office network now connect from hundreds or thousands of different home networks or mobile hotspots to do their jobs.

Every user attempting to reach an application has to prove they should be allowed to access that application based on rules that administrators configure. With our new Teams free plan, up to 50 seats of Access are available at no cost.</p><p>That sounds like adding a burden, but Cloudflare Access integrates with your team’s identity provider and single sign-on (SSO) options to make any application feel as seamless as a SaaS application with SSO. Even if your team does not have a corporate identity provider, you can integrate Access with free services like GitHub and LinkedIn, so your <a href=\"/multi-sso-and-cloudflare-access-adding-linkedin-and-github-teams/\">employees and partners can authenticate</a> without adding cost.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2yArns5J9eEDKHozjra70n/93ccdd223efaa88febf99192c052c1aa/image10-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1639\" height=\"822\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>For hosted applications, you can connect your origin to Cloudflare’s network without opening holes in your firewall <a href=\"/argo-tunnels-that-live-forever/\">using Argo Tunnel</a>.
