Modern attacks use a growing arsenal of deceptive techniques that bypass traditional <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/email-security/secure-email-gateway-seg/\"><u>secure email gateways (SEGs)</u></a> and email authentication measures, targeting organizations, employees, and vendors. From <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/\"><u>business email compromise (BEC)</u></a> to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/what-is-quishing/\"><u>QR phishing</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/access-management/account-takeover/\"><u>account takeovers</u></a>, these threats are designed to exploit weaknesses across multiple communication channels, including email, Slack, Teams, SMS, and cloud drives.</p><p>Phishing remains the most popular attack vector for bad actors looking to gain unauthorized access or extract fraudulent payment, and it is <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/2023-phishing-report/\"><u>estimated</u></a> that 90% of all attacks <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/shields-guidance-families\"><u>start</u></a> with a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/phishing-attack/\"><u>phishing</u></a> email. However, as companies have shifted to using a multitude of apps to support communication and collaboration, attackers too have evolved their approach. Attackers now engage employees across a combination of channels in an attempt to build trust and pivot targeted users to less-secure apps and devices. Cloudflare is uniquely positioned to address this trend thanks to our integrated <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/\"><u>Zero Trust</u></a> services, extensive visibility from protecting <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/proxy/all\"><u>approximately 20% of all websites</u></a>, and signals derived from processing billions of email messages a year.</p><p>Cloudflare recognizes that combating phishing requires an integrated approach and a more complete view of user-based risk. That’s why we’ve designed our email security solution to protect organizations before, during, and after message delivery, while also extending protection beyond email into the broader security ecosystem. Phishing is no longer just an email problem — it’s a multi-channel, cross-application threat.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"assessing-holistic-user-risk\">Assessing holistic user risk</h2>\n      <a href=\"#assessing-holistic-user-risk\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>When it comes to protecting against user-based threats, Cloudflare employs a platform approach to security. Instead of forcing customers to rely on an array of fragmented tools that create unnecessary complexity and blind spots, we treat email security as part of an overall strategy for assessing and responding to user-related risk. Our email security solution works in tandem with our network solutions so that SOC teams can quickly assert what actions their users are performing outside of email. Given our extensive network visibility, our platform is not limited by API integrations, and can provide SOC teams with the best visibility and protection. This helps SOC teams not only combat phishing, but begin to identify and take action against a wider range of insider threats.</p><p>Within a single, unified dashboard, SOC teams can quickly review detailed information regarding the following questions, which we discuss in more detail below: </p><ol><li><p>Who in the organization is being targeted?</p></li><li><p>Who are the attackers impersonating?</p></li><li><p>What risky behaviors are my users performing?</p></li></ol>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"who-in-the-organization-is-being-targeted\">Who in the organization is being targeted?</h3>\n      <a href=\"#who-in-the-organization-is-being-targeted\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7hCZ0UXnPA7Wx5iBHxkfjE/47a143332f6c22c7e11b568b43dfdd74/BLOG-2645_2.png\" alt=\"BLOG-2645 2\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"949\" height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Within the Cloudflare dashboard, SOC teams can view which users are the most targeted. This can help them determine which accounts should be hardened (e.g. MFA enforced), and identify risky users that should be monitored more closely for significant deviations in behavior. One way organizations can use this information is to require high-risk users to connect from a managed device. For instance, if they use Crowdstrike, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/service-providers/crowdstrike/\"><u>we can require that these users be on a managed device</u></a> and force a posture check before letting them access sensitive applications. </p><p>SOC teams can also dive into what types of attacks are hitting their users and at what frequency.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2nVgW0EXy3qzC2hDBeJRAx/5cf8408ec72339fe8985019629912cbb/BLOG-2645_3.png\" alt=\"BLOG-2645 3\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"765\" height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>Customers can use these insights to adjust various platform policies, effectively blocking malicious content and securing sensitive resources.
