That was the last week of campaigning before the October 30 runoff and when several polling predictions were announced. The second and last Bolsonaro-Lula debate was on October 28, and there’s a spike at 22:00 to Lula’s websites, and a smaller but also clear one at 21:00 to Bolsonaro’s websites).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/w1YPjecmNcPY9W9N0IO5O/d694a9db1cc5614272b93b5f07a5cacc/15.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"483\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"news-websites-more-interest-in-the-first-round\">News websites: more interest in the first round</h3>\n      <a href=\"#news-websites-more-interest-in-the-first-round\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>With official election results being available more rapidly, DNS traffic for Brazilian news organization websites peaked much earlier in the evening than what we saw in <a href=\"/french-elections-2022-runoff/\">France</a>, for example, where more definitive election results arrived much later on election day.

It is interesting to not only see that a real world event can impact Internet traffic (and different types of websites) for a whole country, but also see how much that impact is represented at specific times. It’s all about human behavior at relevant moments in time, like elections as a collective event is.</p><p>Past examples of this include important <a href=\"/elections-france-2022/\">presidential elections</a>, the <a href=\"/who-won-super-bowl-lvi-a-look-at-internet-traffic-during-the-big-game/\">Super Bowl</a>, the <a href=\"/oscars-2022-impact/\">Oscars</a>, <a href=\"/eurovision-2022-internet-trends/\">Eurovision</a>, never before seen views of the universe from a <a href=\"/how-the-james-webb-telescopes-cosmic-pictures-impacted-the-internet/\">telescope</a> , the holiday shopping season, or religious events such as <a href=\"/how-ramadan-shows-up-in-internet-trends/\">Ramadan</a>.</p><p>You can keep an eye on these trends using <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a>.</p>",
