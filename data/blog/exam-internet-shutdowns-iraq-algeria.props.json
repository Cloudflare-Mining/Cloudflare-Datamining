Although it is unclear whether such shutdowns are actually successful in curbing cheating, it is clear that they take a financial toll on the impacted countries, with <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/mena-internet-shutdowns-during-exams/\">estimated losses</a> in the millions of US dollars.</p><p>During the first two weeks of June 2023, we’ve seen Iraq implementing a series of multi-hour shutdowns that will reportedly occur through mid-July, as well as Algeria taking similar actions to prevent cheating on baccalaureate exams. Shutdowns in Syria were <a href=\"https://smex.org/syria-internet-shutdowns-planned-despite-promises-to-keep-it-on/\">reported</a> to begin on June 7, but there’s been no indication of them in traffic data as of this writing (June 13). These actions echo those taken in <a href=\"/q2-2022-internet-disruption-summary/\">Iraq, Syria, Sudan, and Algeria</a> in 2022 and in <a href=\"/syria-exam-related-internet-shutdowns/\">Syria</a> and <a href=\"/sudans-exam-related-internet-shutdowns/\">Sudan</a> in 2021.</p><p><i>(Note: The interactive graphs below have been embedded directly into the blog post using a new </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1666078235384479745\"><i>Cloudflare Radar feature</i></a><i>.

The shutdowns observed across Iraq thus far have impacted networks and localities nationwide, with the exception of the autonomous Kurdistan region. However, networks in that region have experienced their own set of connectivity restrictions due to local exams.</p><p>In Iraq, the impact of the shutdowns between 04:00 - 08:00 local time (01:00 - 05:00 UTC) is clearly visible at a country level, as seen in the figure below.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?location=iq&dateStart=2023-05-30&dateEnd=2023-06-13&chartState=%7B%22traffictrends.minmax%22%3Afalse%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D\" title=\"Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends\" frameBorder=\"0\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The impact is, of course, also visible in the network-level graphs shown below, with traffic dropping to or near zero during each of the four-hour shutdown windows.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?location=as203735&dateStart=2023-05-30&dateEnd=2023-06-13&chartState=%7B%22traffictrends.minmax%22%3Afalse%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D\" title=\"Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends\" frameBorder=\"0\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The shutdowns are also visible in the BGP announcement activity from the impacted networks, with spikes in announcement volume clearly visible around the shutdown windows each day that they have occurred.

This drop in DNS traffic, combined with the lack of BGP announcement activity, suggests that the Internet disruptions in the Kurdistan region may be implemented as widespread blocking of Internet traffic, rather than routing-based shutdowns.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3RurKF2pkeJe18zyhticmY/f6573e33a1c53957a47f96e34292954e/June-13---Iraq---1111---tcpudp.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1050\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In the “totalDoHDoT” graph below, we can see noticeable drops in traffic that align with the dates and times where we observed the traffic disruptions in the rest of Iraq.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6vYdGa4A6CqvW8bVFu426I/1abb129bf75efd41a833ba6cef934db2/June-13---Iraq---1111---dohdot.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1050\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>It isn’t immediately clear why there is a difference in the use of 1.1.1.1 between the two parts of the country.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"algeria\">Algeria</h3>\n      <a href=\"#algeria\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In Algeria, it appears that the country is following a <a href=\"/syria-sudan-algeria-exam-internet-shutdown/\">similar pattern as that seen in 2021 and 2022</a>, with two multi-hour Internet disruptions each day.
