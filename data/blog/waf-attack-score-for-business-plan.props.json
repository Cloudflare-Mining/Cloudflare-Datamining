The <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/\">CVE</a> (common vulnerabilities and exposures) program has a list with over 197,000 records to track disclosed vulnerabilities.</p><p>That makes it really hard for web application owners to harden and update their system regularly, especially when we talk about critical libraries and the exploitation damage that can happen in case of information leak. That’s why web application owners tend to use <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">WAFs (Web Application Firewalls)</a> to protect their online presence.</p><p>Most WAFs use signature-based detections, which are rules created based on specific attacks that we know about. The signature-based method is very fast, has a low rate of false positives (these are the requests that are categorized as attack when they are actually legitimate), and is very efficient with most of the attack categories we know. However, they sometimes have a blind spot when a new attack happens, often called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)?cf_target_id=E4C6647B3175407AE832B11B197C13AB\">zero-day</a> attacks. As soon as a new vulnerability is found, our security analysts take fast action to stop it in a matter of hours and update the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/\">WAF Managed Rules</a>, yet we want to protect our customers during this time as well.</p><p>This is the main reason Cloudflare created a complementary feature to the WAF <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/\">managed rules</a>: a smart machine learning layer to help detect unknown attacks, and protect customers even during the time gap until rules are updated.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"early-detection-powerful-mitigation-safer-internet\">Early detection + Powerful mitigation = Safer Internet</h3>\n      <a href=\"#early-detection-powerful-mitigation-safer-internet\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6QVg4BUsujsYrq75VAHZiL/d3b594dfebf2aba889d9ab521b916413/image2-15.png\" alt=\"Diagram visualizing the machine learning model classification of HTTP requests, passing Attack Score Class field to the WAF\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1717\" height=\"483\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The performance of any <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-machine-learning/\">machine learning</a> drastically depends on the data it was trained on. Our machine learning uses a supervised model that was trained over hundreds of millions of requests generated by WAF Managed Rules, data varies between clean and malicious, some were blended with fuzzy techniques to enable catching similar patterns as covered in our blog “<a href=\"/data-generation-and-sampling-strategies/\">Improving the accuracy of our machine learning WAF</a>”. At the moment, there are three types of attacks our machine learning model is optimized to find: SQL Injection (SQLi), <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/how-to-prevent-xss-attacks/\">Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</a>, and a wide range of Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks such as shell injection, PHP injection, Apache Struts type compromises, Apache log4j, and similar attacks that result in RCE.</p><p>And the reason why we started with them is based on Cloudflare’s <a href=\"/application-security-2023/\">Application Security Report</a>. These categories represent more than 24% of the mitigated layer 7 attacks over the last year in our WAF, therefore more prone to exploitations.</p><p>In the full Enterprise WAF Attack Score version we offer more granularity on the attack categories and we provide scores for each class where they can be configured freely per domain.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"waf-attack-score-lite-features-for-business-plan\">WAF Attack Score Lite Features for Business Plan</h3>\n      <a href=\"#waf-attack-score-lite-features-for-business-plan\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>WAF Attack Score Lite and the Security Analytics view offer three main functions:</p><p><b>1- Attack detection:</b> This happens through inspecting every incoming HTTP request, bucketing or classifying the requests into 4 types: Attacks, Likely Attacks, Likely Clean and Clean.
