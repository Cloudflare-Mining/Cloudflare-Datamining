These graphs show normalized traffic volumes measured in bytes, derived from aggregated<a href=\"https://www.kentik.com/kentipedia/what-is-netflow-overview/\"><u> NetFlow</u></a> data. (NetFlow is a protocol used to collect metadata about IP traffic flows traversing network devices.) Today, we’re adding an additional metric that reflects the number of HTTP requests, normalized over the same time period. By comparing bytes with requests, readers can gain additional insights into traffic patterns and user behavior. Below, we review how this new data has been incorporated into Radar, and explore HTTP request traffic in more detail.</p><p>Note that while we refer to “HTTP request traffic” in this post and on Radar, the term encompasses requests made in the clear over HTTP <b>and</b> over encrypted connections using HTTPS – the latter accounts for <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage?dateStart=2024-07-01&dateEnd=2024-07-31\"><u>~95% of all requests to Cloudflare during July 2024</u></a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"new-and-updated-graphs\">New and updated graphs</h2>\n            <a href=\"#new-and-updated-graphs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Graphs including HTTP request-based traffic data have been added to the Overview and Traffic sections on Cloudflare Radar.

One key reason for analyzing and including HTTP request traffic is resilience. Having multiple sources of truth with respect to HTTP traffic allows us to ​​better and more quickly distinguish between real events (such as an Internet disruption in a given country or network) and data pipeline issues.</p><p>While bytes-based metrics provide a reasonable proxy into human (user) behavior, especially with respect to activity surrounding Internet disruptions, request-based metrics provide an even better perspective. A lot of HTTP traffic involves relatively small responses – especially API traffic, which now <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/application-security-report-2024-update\"><u>accounts for 60%</u></a> of all traffic. Furthermore, response sizes can vary widely, ranging from a single-pixel GIF accounting for just a few bytes, to an API call that returns a few kilobytes of data, to a multi-gigabyte software package</p><p>To that end, the scope of user activity may be insufficiently reflected by a bytes-based metric, or buried in the noise, whereas request activity provides a cleaner signal and a more direct proxy for user activity. This is especially important as we examine the restoration of connectivity after an Internet disruption, attempting to ascertain when activity has returned to “expected” pre-disruption levels.</p><p>Finally, incorporating request-based traffic insights into Radar is simply extending the way that the data is already being used on the site. All of the graphs, maps, and tables presented on Radar’s <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage\"><u>Adoption &amp; Usage</u></a> page, are based on analysis of HTTP request traffic, making use of information contained within request headers (such as HTTP version or user agent) or characteristics of the underlying connection (such as IP version).</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"bytes-vs-requests-whats-the-difference\">Bytes vs requests – what’s the difference?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#bytes-vs-requests-whats-the-difference\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>The current “HTTP traffic” view aggregates the bytes associated with HTTP requests to Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/\"><u>content delivery (CDN)</u></a> services from the selected location or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/\"><u>autonomous system (ASN)</u></a>. “Total traffic” aggregates this HTTP traffic along with the traffic associated with other Cloudflare services, including our <a href=\"https://one.one.one.one/dns/\"><u>1.1.1.1 DNS resolver</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/dns/\"><u>authoritative DNS</u></a>, <a href=\"https://one.one.one.one/\"><u>WARP</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/\"><u>Spectrum</u></a>, among others. (While Spectrum, WARP, and 1.1.1.1 also carry HTTP traffic, the share of HTTP traffic carried by these services is opaque to Radar, and isn&#39;t accounted for as part of the HTTP traffic calculations.)</p><p>The bytes associated with a given request include the size of the request, the size of the headers associated with the response, and the size of the response itself. As noted above, the size of a file returned in response to a request can vary widely, depending on what was requested. The shape of the HTTP requests and HTTP bytes lines may be quite similar, but the potential variability in response sizes (in aggregate) can cause the lines to diverge, sometimes significantly so. For example, if an application regularly makes background requests to check for updates, the availability and subsequent download of a large file containing a software update would cause a spike in the HTTP bytes line, while the HTTP requests pattern remained consistent. </p><p>As another example, consider the graph below, capturing HTTP requests and bytes traffic trends for Portugal during the first week of August. HTTP bytes traffic initially grows each day between 06:00 and 09:00 UTC (07:00 - 10:00 local summer time), increases much more slowly until around 19:00 UTC (20:00 local summer time), and then increases rapidly before peaking around 21:00 UTC (22:00 local time). This suggests that content consumed during the workday is lighter in terms of bytes (such as API traffic, as discussed above), while evening traffic is more byte-heavy (possibly due to increased consumption of media content). In contrast, after starting to increase around 06:00 UTC (07:00 local summer time), request traffic generally sees three successively higher peaks each day – occurring around 10:00, 14:00, and 21:00 UTC respectively (11:00, 15:00, and 22:00 local summer time). These peaks are most pronounced on weekdays, but are still apparent on weekend days as well, suggesting regular patterns of user activity at those times.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3LSadrlwBTmm091qayB6sS/2dc5afb1ce0470f50cfc81325e729100/2493-8.png\" alt=\"2493-8\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1494\" height=\"660\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p></p><p>It is important to remember that in looking at the “HTTP requests &amp; bytes” graphs on Radar that they are showing two different metrics, and as such, only their shape over time is comparable, not their relative sizes.
