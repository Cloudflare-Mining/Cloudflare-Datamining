Since Marek hadn&#39;t given me a pcap, I manually converted the first few to hex.</p><p>The reason hex is useful is that bytes, words, dwords, and qwords are the real stuff of computing and looking at decimal obscures data.</p><p>Taking the first three (one for each TTL), I saw this pattern:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">1.181.207.7.46337\n2.10.30.2.2562\n4.72.42.184.18436\n\nConverted to hex they are\n\n01.b5.cf.07.b501\n02.0a.1e.02.0a02\n04.48.2a.b8.4804</pre></code>\n            <p>It&#39;s immediately obvious that the &#39;random&#39; source port is the first two bytes of the random IP source address reversed: <code>01.b5.cf.07</code> has source port <code>b501</code>.</p><p>A little bit of tinkering revealed a relationship between the TTL and the first byte of the IP address.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">TTL = first byte &gt;&gt; 1 + 40</pre></code>\n            <p>This relationship was confirmed by a later packet that had a TTL of 150 and a source IP of 220.255.141.181. The shift right also explained why the same TTL was used when the first byte differed by one (see the third group above for an example: 4.x.x.x and 5.x.x.x have the same TTL).</p><p>I then spotted that the DNS ID field was also related to the IP address.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">1.181.207.7.46337 &gt; x.x.x.x.53: 65098+\n\nConverted to hex:\n\n01.b5.cf.07.b501 &gt; x.x.x.x.35: fe4a+</pre></code>\n            <p>It&#39;s probably not obvious at first glance (unless you&#39;re a hex-level hacker), but fe4a is the one&#39;s complement of 01b5. So the DNS ID field was simply the one&#39;s complement of the first two bytes of the source IP.</p><p>Finally, Marek gave me a pcap, and I had one more relationship to find. The ID value in the IPv4 header was also related to the random source IP address—in fact, it was just the first two bytes of the IP address.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"mystery\">Mystery</h3>\n            <a href=\"#mystery\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>One mystery remains (and there&#39;s a CloudFlare T-shirt for person with the most convincing explanation): How are the random source IPs being generated?</p><p>The answer might be boring (i.e. it might just be reading bytes from /dev/random), but given the author&#39;s love of relationships between fields, perhaps there&#39;s something else going on.
