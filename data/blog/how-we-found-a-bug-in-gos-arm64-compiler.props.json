Our monitoring watches this closely, and it started to observe very sporadic panics on arm64 machines.</p><p>We first saw one with a fatal error stating that <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/blob/c0ee2fd4e309ef0b8f4ab6f4860e2626c8e00802/src/runtime/traceback.go#L566\"><u>traceback did not unwind completely</u></a>. That error suggests that invariants were violated when traversing the stack, likely because of stack corruption. After a brief investigation we decided that it was probably rare stack memory corruption. This was a largely idle control plane service where unplanned restarts have negligible impact, and so we felt that following up was not a priority unless it kept happening.</p><p>And then it kept happening. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h4 id=\"coredumps-per-hour\">Coredumps per hour</h4>\n      <a href=\"#coredumps-per-hour\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7ohMD2ph3I9l7lbZQWZ4xl/243e679d8293565fc6a55a670c9f3583/BLOG-2906_2.png\" alt=\"BLOG-2906 2\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"526\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p>When we first saw this bug we saw that the fatal errors correlated with recovered panics.

Fatal panics gone, our theoretical mitigation seemed to work, and this was no longer our problem. We subscribed to the upstream issue so we could update when it was resolved and put it out of our minds.</p><p>But, this turned out to be a much stranger bug than expected. Putting it out of our minds was premature as the same class of fatal panics came back at a much higher rate. A month later, we were seeing up to 30 daily fatal panics with no real discernible cause; while that might account for only one machine a day in less than 10% of our data centers, we found it concerning that we didn’t understand the cause. The first thing we checked was the number of recovered panics, to match our previous pattern, but there were none. More interestingly, we could not correlate this increased rate of fatal panics with anything. A release? Infrastructure changes? The position of Mars? </p><p>At this point we felt like we needed to dive deeper to better understand the root cause. Pattern matching and hoping was clearly insufficient. </p><p>We saw two classes of this bug -- a crash while accessing invalid memory and an explicitly checked fatal error. </p>\n    <div class=\"flex

Many goroutines are scheduled on a smaller number of kernel threads – this is often referred to as M:N scheduling. Any individual goroutine can be scheduled on any kernel thread. The scheduler has three core types – <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L394\"><code><u>g</u></code></a>  (the goroutine), <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L536\"><code><u>m</u></code></a> (the kernel thread, or “machine”), and <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L644\"><code><u>p</u></code></a> (the physical execution context, or  “processor”). For a goroutine to be scheduled a free <code>m</code> must acquire a free <code>p</code>, which will execute a g. Each <code>g</code> contains a field for its m if it is currently running, otherwise it will be <b>nil</b>. This is all the context needed for this post but the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/HACKING.md#gs-ms-ps\"><u>go runtime docs</u></a> explore this more comprehensively. </p><p>At this point we can start to make inferences on what’s happening: the program crashes because we try to unwind a goroutine stack which is invalid. In the first backtrace, if a <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b3251514531123d7fd007682389bce7428d159a0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L446\"><u>return address is null, we call </u><code><u>finishInternal</u></code><u> and abort because the stack was not fully unwound</u></a>. The segmentation fault case in the second backtrace is a bit more interesting: if instead the return address is non-zero but not a function then the unwinder code assumes that the goroutine is currently running. It&#39;ll then dereference m and fault by accessing <code>m.incgo</code> (the offset of <code>incgo</code> into <code>struct m</code> is 0x118, the faulting memory access). </p><p>What, then, is causing this corruption? The traces were difficult to get anything useful from – our service has hundreds if not thousands of active goroutines. It was fairly clear from the beginning that the panic was remote from the actual bug. The crashes were all observed while unwinding the stack and if this were an issue any time the stack was unwound on arm64 we would be seeing it in many more services. We felt pretty confident that the stack unwinding was happening correctly but on an invalid stack. </p><p>Our investigation stalled for a while at this point – making guesses, testing guesses, trying to infer if the panic rate went up or down, or if nothing changed. There was <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73259\"><u>a known issue</u></a> on Go’s GitHub issue tracker which matched our symptoms almost exactly, but what they discussed was mostly what we already knew.

If the stack pointer is partially modified, the unwinder will look for the calling function in the middle of the stack. The underlying data is meaningless when interpreted as directions to a parent stack frame and then the runtime will likely crash. </p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Go\"><code class=\"language-Go\">//https://github.com/golang/go/blob/66536242fce34787230c42078a7bbd373ef8dcb0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L373\n\nif innermost &amp;&amp; frame.sp &lt; frame.fp || frame.lr == 0 {\n    lrPtr = frame.sp\n    frame.lr = *(*uintptr)(unsafe.Pointer(lrPtr))\n}\n</pre></code>\n            <p></p><p>When async preemption happens it will push a function call onto the stack but the parent stack frame is no longer correct because sp was only partially adjusted when the preemption happened.

This bug is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/e8794e650e05fad07a33fb6e3266a9e677d13fa8\"><u>go1.23.12</u></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/6e1c4529e4e00ab58572deceab74cc4057e6f0b6\"><u>go1.24.6</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/f7cc61e7d7f77521e073137c6045ba73f66ef902\"><u>go1.25.0</u></a>. Previously, the go compiler emitted a single <code>add x, rsp</code> instruction and relied on the assembler to split immediates into multiple opcodes as necessary. After this change, stacks larger than 1&lt;&lt;12 will build the offset in a temporary register and then add that to <code>rsp</code> in a single, indivisible opcode. A goroutine can be preempted before or after the stack pointer modification, but never during. This means that the stack pointer is always valid and there is no race condition.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">LDP -8(RSP), (R29, R30)\nMOVD $32, R27\nMOVK $(1&lt;&lt;16), R27\nADD R27, RSP, RSP\nRET</pre></code>\n            <p></p><p>This was a very fun problem to debug. We don’t often see bugs where you can accurately blame the compiler. Debugging it took weeks and we had to learn about areas of the Go runtime that people don’t usually need to think about. It’s a nice example of a rare race condition, the sort of bug that can only really be quantified at a large scale.</p><p>We’re always looking for people who enjoy this kind of detective work. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/?department=Engineering\"><u>Our engineering teams are hiring</u></a>.   </p>",
