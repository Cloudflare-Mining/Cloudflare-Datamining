Each of these partner companies and individuals went above and beyond, demonstrating outstanding commitment to working closely with Cloudflare to build technical competencies and to deliver compelling, integrated security and performance solutions for customers around the globe.</p><p>This past year was another milestone year, with record-setting growth for Cloudflare and our partners. The Cloudflare Channel and Alliances Partner Program received the highest, 5-star rating in CRN’s Partner Program Guide. New customer bookings acquired through partners jumped over 28% year over year.</p><p>In June, we announced the Cloudflare One Partner Specialization, with tailored enablement and new partner go-to-market resources for Cloudflare One, our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/\">SASE</a> solution which includes the industry’s first, 100% Cloud-native Zero Trust platform. More than 1,600 partner sellers and technical sellers have completed Cloudflare Zero Trust training courses, enabling them to deliver the most comprehensive security needed in today’s connect-from-anywhere economy.The Cloudflare Channel Partner Network contributed to the significant market traction we’ve seen for Cloudflare One, including partner-sourced pipeline for Cloudflare One growing 240% from Q1 through Q4 of 2022.</p><p>As organizations across industries and the public sector require a fast and secure path to Zero Trust architectures, going forward Cloudflare partners will play an even more strategic role in Cloudflare’s growth.  We look to our partners to deliver not only Cloudflare solutions but the managed or professional services customers need to help them. For instance, to conduct Zero Trust assessments, migrate from legacy products, integrate with existing technology stacks, and provide ongoing services and support. As notable a year as 2022 was, we are even more excited about what we’ll achieve together with our partners in 2023!</p><p>Congratulations to our Partner Award winners, and thank you to all our partners for your dedication and commitment to delivering a faster, more secure, and more reliable Internet for customers and their users globally.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor
