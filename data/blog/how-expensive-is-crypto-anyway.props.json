More than half of our external traffic is now TLS, as well as all of our internal traffic. Being in that position means that crypto performance is critical to our success, and as it happens, every now and then we like to profile our production servers, to identify and fix hot spots.</p><p>In this post I want to share the latest profiling results that relate to crypto.</p><p>The profiled server is located in our Frankfurt data center, and sports 2 Xeon Silver 4116 processors. Every geography has a slightly different use pattern of TLS. In Frankfurt 73% of the requests are TLS, and the negotiated cipher-suites break down like so:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5FwOwwcCOKEmKPXC39AKre/65ef57db90078551f6e6f87356acf7dc/Cloudflare--Frankfurt---negotiated-TLS-cipher-suites.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1388\" height=\"1040\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Processing all of those different ciphersuites, BoringSSL consumes just 1.8% of the CPU time.

Finally there is a small fraction that still uses RSA for key exchange, the only key exchange algorithm currently used, that does not provide Forward Secrecy guarantees.</p><p>The second function is that of a signature used to sign the handshake parameters and thus authenticate the server to the client. As a signature RSA is very much alive, present in almost one quarter of the connections, the other three quarters using ECDSA.</p><p>BoringSSL speed reports that a single core on our server can perform 1,120 RSA2048 signatures/s, 120 RSA4096 signatures/s, 18,477 P256 ESDSA signatures/s, 9,394 P256 ECDHE operations/s and 9,278 x25519 ECDHE operations/s.</p><p>Looking at the CPU consumption, it is clear that RSA is <i>very</i> expensive. Roughly half the time BoringSSL performs an operation related to RSA. P256 consumes twice as much CPU time as x25519, but considering that it handles twice as much key-exchanges, while also being used as a signature, that is commendable.</p><p>If you want to make the internet a better place, please get an ECDSA signed certificate next time!</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"hash-functions\">Hash functions</h3>\n            <a href=\"#hash-functions\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Only two hash function are currently used in TLS: SHA1 and SHA2 (including SHA384).
