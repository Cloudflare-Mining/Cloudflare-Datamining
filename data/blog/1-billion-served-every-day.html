	<p>About 8 months ago I posted a blog post about how CloudFlare had <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1-billion-requests-served">served 1 billion requests that month</a>. It was quite a milestone for our young startup. This week we crossed a new milestone: now serving more than 1 billion requests <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every day</span>. In other words, we've grown about 3,000% in 8 months. Great job team!!</p>
