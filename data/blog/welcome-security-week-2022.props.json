The current threat is significantly higher than before and any organization with Internet-facing infrastructure should put security as a top priority for the year.</p><p>To help keep services online, Cloudflare is also participating in the <a href=\"https://criticalinfrastructuredefense.org/\">Critical Infrastructure Defense Project</a> ensuring teams can get the best help to secure networks and applications more vulnerable to cyber threats, such as those in the medical, water and energy sectors.</p><p>As another example, not too long ago, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/log4j/\">Log4J</a>, a high-severity vulnerability affecting many Java-based applications, also highlighted how important good security is on the Internet as attackers immediately started scanning for vulnerable applications within hours of the attack vector becoming public.</p><p>Unfortunately, these events are almost certainly not going to be our last reminders.</p><p>Over the next six days, we intend to tackle the broad topic of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-cyber-security/\">cyber security</a> with a simple goal: ensure security is <a href=\"/welcome-to-security-week-2021/\">no longer an afterthought</a>.</p><p>Security, however, is also hard, and you never know when “you’ve done enough”. The importance of good security practices should never be underestimated. Reliable and secure applications ensure the Internet operates properly: from keeping sites online in order to ensure access to essential information, to protecting user data from being stolen and misused.</p><p>But not everyone is a security expert.</p><p>To that point, Cloudflare has always been about applying technically sophisticated solutions to tricky problems, and making those solutions generally accessible. During this week, you will also hear about a mix of product enhancements, new offerings, and audacious ideas and partnerships, including some great new features we will be providing to all Cloudflare users, for free.</p><p>Before we jump in, the best way to understand where we are headed is to take a step back and revisit our story. And that’s what I hope to do in this post. As you read the story, I will call out which days of the week will have relevant announcements, so you know when you should tune in.</p><p>Welcome to Security Week.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"back-to-the-beginning-securing-websites\">Back to the beginning: securing websites</h3>\n      <a href=\"#back-to-the-beginning-securing-websites\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>When I first joined Cloudflare seven years ago, our security offerings were mostly targeted at website owners: <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/\">DNS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/\">DDoS mitigation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/\">SSL/TLS</a>. As an HTTP reverse proxy, Cloudflare could <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/how-to-secure-a-website/\">secure traffic</a> and keep malicious payloads at bay. At the same time, we immediately started working on making the underlying protocols faster and safer.

By focusing on a forward proxy security strategy, all of a sudden, we could protect users, not just applications and servers.</p><p>Any user connecting to the Internet can now configure <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/\">Cloudflare as their DNS resolver</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/\">forward proxy</a>, allowing them to experience the Internet with an additional safety shield. Enter <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/\">Cloudflare Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>It was at this moment that proxy was no longer a term that clearly identified what we were building. Network was a much better term. In fact, as many things in computing repeat themselves, the <a href=\"/the-network-is-the-computer/\">network became the computer</a>, again.</p><p>The network effects (no pun intended) are not immediately obvious. Think about a user setting up Cloudflare as a DNS resolver accessing an application itself behind Cloudflare: the entire transaction can happen at the closest data center to the end user, starting from DNS to HTTP. That’s also why we are not going to stop <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-grows-its-network-to-speed-up-and-secure-the-internet/\">expanding our network</a> anytime soon. The benefits are immeasurable and security is baked in at every single step, without compromising performance.</p><p>If that user is a team member from the same organization that runs the application, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust concepts</a> become accessible and easy to deploy for anyone. Old systems like VPNs become obsolete as you no longer need clunky, complex infrastructure to secure your network, bringing us one step closer to democratizing security.</p><blockquote><p><i>Security Week: If you are using </i><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/\"><i>Cloudflare Zero Trust</i></a><i> and are trying to secure internal networks, tune in on Friday - we have some great product improvements to share.</i></p></blockquote>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"cloudflare-is-a-smart-secure-network\">Cloudflare is a smart secure network</h3>\n      <a href=\"#cloudflare-is-a-smart-secure-network\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>This brings us to today. Security used to be about creating secure environments — castle and moat. But mobile and the cloud have cracked the paradigm. Nowhere is presumed secure anymore, and even if there was somewhere secure, your users and applications probably wouldn&#39;t stay there for long anyway. They&#39;re working from… home? Across the country? Across the world? Your applications are also constantly moving.</p><p>In this paradigm, the logical way to think about security is by not creating a physical enclave. Instead, you need to create a virtual one by focusing on the one fundamental component of the Internet: the network.</p><p>In other words, you need to make sure every device, every office, every server that you have is connected to a secure network. At Cloudflare, we are building just that - a network that connects your users to your applications and vice versa, wherever they are, and provides security and privacy as a core fundamental.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"to-make-it-better-we-also-need-to-lead\">To make it better, we also need to lead</h3>\n      <a href=\"#to-make-it-better-we-also-need-to-lead\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Having great technology is not enough.
