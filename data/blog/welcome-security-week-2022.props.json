The current threat is significantly higher than before and any organization with Internet-facing infrastructure should put security as a top priority for the year.</p><p>To help keep services online, Cloudflare is also participating in the <a href=\"https://criticalinfrastructuredefense.org/\">Critical Infrastructure Defense Project</a> ensuring teams can get the best help to secure networks and applications more vulnerable to cyber threats, such as those in the medical, water and energy sectors.</p><p>As another example, not too long ago, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/log4j/\">Log4J</a>, a high-severity vulnerability affecting many Java-based applications, also highlighted how important good security is on the Internet as attackers immediately started scanning for vulnerable applications within hours of the attack vector becoming public.</p><p>Unfortunately, these events are almost certainly not going to be our last reminders.</p><p>Over the next six days, we intend to tackle the broad topic of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-cyber-security/\">cyber security</a> with a simple goal: ensure security is <a href=\"/welcome-to-security-week-2021/\">no longer an afterthought</a>.</p><p>Security, however, is also hard, and you never know when “you’ve done enough”. The importance of good security practices should never be underestimated. Reliable and secure applications ensure the Internet operates properly: from keeping sites online in order to ensure access to essential information, to protecting user data from being stolen and misused.</p><p>But not everyone is a security expert.</p><p>To that point, Cloudflare has always been about applying technically sophisticated solutions to tricky problems, and making those solutions generally accessible. During this week, you will also hear about a mix of product enhancements, new offerings, and audacious ideas and partnerships, including some great new features we will be providing to all Cloudflare users, for free.</p><p>Before we jump in, the best way to understand where we are headed is to take a step back and revisit our story. And that’s what I hope to do in this post. As you read the story, I will call out which days of the week will have relevant announcements, so you know when you should tune in.</p><p>Welcome to Security Week.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"back-to-the-beginning-securing-websites\">Back to the beginning: securing websites</h3>\n            <a href=\"#back-to-the-beginning-securing-websites\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>When I first joined Cloudflare seven years ago, our security offerings were mostly targeted at website owners: <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/\">DNS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/\">DDoS mitigation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/\">SSL/TLS</a>.

By focusing on a forward proxy security strategy, all of a sudden, we could protect users, not just applications and servers.</p><p>Any user connecting to the Internet can now configure <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/\">Cloudflare as their DNS resolver</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/\">forward proxy</a>, allowing them to experience the Internet with an additional safety shield. Enter <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/\">Cloudflare Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>It was at this moment that proxy was no longer a term that clearly identified what we were building. Network was a much better term. In fact, as many things in computing repeat themselves, the <a href=\"/the-network-is-the-computer/\">network became the computer</a>, again.</p><p>The network effects (no pun intended) are not immediately obvious. Think about a user setting up Cloudflare as a DNS resolver accessing an application itself behind Cloudflare: the entire transaction can happen at the closest data center to the end user, starting from DNS to HTTP. That’s also why we are not going to stop <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-grows-its-network-to-speed-up-and-secure-the-internet/\">expanding our network</a> anytime soon.

Old systems like VPNs become obsolete as you no longer need clunky, complex infrastructure to secure your network, bringing us one step closer to democratizing security.</p><blockquote><p><i>Security Week: If you are using </i><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/\"><i>Cloudflare Zero Trust</i></a><i> and are trying to secure internal networks, tune in on Friday - we have some great product improvements to share.</i></p></blockquote>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"cloudflare-is-a-smart-secure-network\">Cloudflare is a smart secure network</h3>\n            <a href=\"#cloudflare-is-a-smart-secure-network\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>This brings us to today. Security used to be about creating secure environments — castle and moat. But mobile and the cloud have cracked the paradigm. Nowhere is presumed secure anymore, and even if there was somewhere secure, your users and applications probably wouldn&#39;t stay there for long anyway. They&#39;re working from… home? Across the country? Across the world? Your applications are also constantly moving.</p><p>In this paradigm, the logical way to think about security is by not creating a physical enclave. Instead, you need to create a virtual one by focusing on the one fundamental component of the Internet: the network.</p><p>In other words, you need to make sure every device, every office, every server that you have is connected to a secure network. At Cloudflare, we are building just that - a network that connects your users to your applications and vice versa, wherever they are, and provides security and privacy as a core fundamental.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"to-make-it-better-we-also-need-to-lead\">To make it better, we also need to lead</h3>\n            <a href=\"#to-make-it-better-we-also-need-to-lead\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Having great technology is not enough.
