It used to be composed of static websites: with text, images, and the occasional embedded movie. But the Internet has grown enormously. We now rely on API-driven applications to help with almost every aspect of life. Rather than just download files, we are able to <i>engage</i> with apps by exchanging rich data. We track workouts and send the results to the cloud. We use smart locks and all kinds of IoT devices. And we interact with our friends online.</p><p>This is all wonderful, but it comes with an explosion of complexity on the back end. Why? Developers need to manage <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/api/what-is-an-api/\">APIs</a> in order to support this functionality. They need to monitor and authenticate every single request. And because these tasks are so difficult, they’re usually outsourced to an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/api/what-is-an-api-gateway/\">API gateway</a> provider.</p><p>Unfortunately, today’s gateways leave a lot to be desired. First: they’re not cheap. Then there’s the performance impact. And finally, there’s a data and privacy risk, since <a href=\"/landscape-of-api-traffic/\">more than 50% of traffic</a> reaches APIs (and is presumably sent through a third party gateway). What a mess.</p><p>Today we’re announcing the Cloudflare API Gateway. <b>We’re going to completely replace your existing gateway at a fraction of the cost.</b> And our solution uses the technology behind <a href=\"https://workers.cloudflare.com/\">Workers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/\">Bot Management</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/\">Access</a>, and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/\">Transform Rules</a> to provide the most advanced API toolset on the market.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"what-is-api-gateway\">What is API Gateway?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#what-is-api-gateway\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>In short, it’s a package of features that will do everything for your APIs. We break it down into three categories:</p><p><b>Security</b>These are the products we have already blogged about. Tools like <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/products/api-discovery/\">Discovery</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/products/schema-validation/\">Schema Validation</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/products/volumetric-abuse-detection/\">Abuse Detection</a>, and more. We’ve spent a lot of time applying our security expertise to the world of APIs.</p><p><b>Management &amp; Monitoring</b>These are the foundational tools that keep your APIs in order. Some examples: analytics, routing, and authentication. We are already able to do these things with existing products like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/\">Cloudflare Access</a>, and more features are on the way.</p><p><b>Everything Else</b>These are the small (but crucial) items that keep everything running. Cloudflare already offers SSL/TLS termination, load balancing, and proxy services that can run by default.</p><p>Today’s blog post describes each feature in detail. We’re excited to announce that <i>all</i> the security features are now generally available, so let’s start by discussing those.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"discovery\">Discovery</h2>\n            <a href=\"#discovery\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Our customers are eager to protect their APIs. Unfortunately, they don’t always have these endpoints documented—or worse, they <i>think</i> everything is documented, but have unknowingly lost or modified endpoints. These hidden endpoints are sometimes called <a href=\"https://www.bearer.com/resources/shadow-apis-detect-business-risk\">shadow APIs</a>. We need to begin our journey with an exhaustive (and accurate) picture of API surface area.</p><p>That’s where Discovery comes in. Head to the <a href=\"https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/api-shield\">Cloudflare dashboard</a>, select the <b>Security</b> tab, then choose “API Shield.” Activate the feature and tell us how you want to identify your API traffic.

But what about abusive traffic that makes it through?</p><p>As Cloudflare discovers new API endpoints, we actually <i>suggest rate limits</i> for each one. That’s the role of Abuse Detection, and it opens the door to a more sophisticated kind of security.</p><p>Consider an API endpoint that returns weather updates. Specifically, the endpoint will return “yes” if it is likely to snow in the next hour, and “no” otherwise. Our algorithm might detect that the average user requests this data once every 10 minutes. A small group of scrapers, however, makes 37 requests per 10 minutes. Cloudflare automatically recommends a threshold in between, weighted to provide normal users with some breathing room. This would prevent abusive scraping services from fetching the weather too often.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7AmCy8IlDu6F2xQMz6Y9Bh/6860464fc5cf83b3de7586dc2b9ffcf3/image3-18.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>We provide the option to create a rule using our new <a href=\"/advanced-rate-limiting/\">Advanced Rate Limiting</a> engine.

Modern applications are behemoths, so developers break them up into smaller chunks called “microservices.”</p><p>Consider an application that helps you book a hotel room. It might use a microservice to fetch available dates, another to fetch prices, and still another to fetch room types. Perhaps a different team manages each microservice, but they all need to be available from a single public entry point:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2vE5CLMCH7SBOvyjUEdz1a/de4787c48618f8e7cfc3f97ebb9d419e/image8.png\" alt=\"Various steps in an architecture that relies on microservices. A visitor makes a request to a hotel API, which is then routed towards available dates, prices, or room types.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1063\" height=\"555\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>That single entry point—traditionally managed by an API gateway—is responsible for <i>routing</i> each request to the right microservice. Many of our customers have been paying standalone services to do this for years. That’s no longer necessary. We’ve built on our <a href=\"/introducing-transform-rules-with-url-rewriting-at-the-edge/\">Transform Rules</a> product to dynamically re-write and re-route at our edge. It’s easy to configure, fast to deploy, and natively built into API Gateway. Cloudflare can now be your API’s single point of entry.</p><p>That’s just the tip of the iceberg. API Gateway can actually <i>replace</i> your microservices through an integration with our <a href=\"https://workers.cloudflare.com/\">Workers</a> product. How? Consider writing a Worker that performs some action; perhaps return hotel prices, which are stored with <a href=\"/durable-objects-ga/\">Durable Objects</a> on our network. With API Gateway, requests arrive at our network, are routed to the correct microservice with Transform Rules, and then are fully served with Workers (still on our network!). These Workers may contact your origin for additional information, where necessary.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5Xlw0UyeftYsiiFsGbrHbE/3dad73d794d9c822fb17d5a09c8a32ac/image4-3.png\" alt=\"Cloudflare’s simplified API architecture.

Similarly, we keep track of each request’s lifespan as it is received, validated, routed, and responded to.
