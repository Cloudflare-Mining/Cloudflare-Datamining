At the same time, we gave our enterprise customers the ability to use WARP with Cloudflare for Teams. By routing all an enterprise&#39;s traffic from devices anywhere on the planet through WARP, we’ve been able to seamlessly power advanced capabilities such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/gateway/\">Secure Web Gateway</a> and <a href=\"/browser-isolation-for-teams-of-all-sizes/\">Browser Isolation</a> and, in the future, our <a href=\"/data-loss-prevention/\">Data Loss Prevention</a> platforms.</p><p>Today, we are excited to announce Cloudflare WARP for Linux and, across all desktop platforms, the ability to use WARP with single applications instead of your entire device.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"what-is-warp\">What is WARP?</h2>\n            <a href=\"#what-is-warp\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>WARP was built on the philosophy that even people who don’t know what <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-vpn/\">“VPN” stands for</a> should be able to still easily get the protection a VPN offers. It was also built for those of us who are unfortunately all too familiar with traditional corporate VPNs, and need an innovative, seamless solution to meet the challenges of an always-connected world.</p><p>Enter our own WireGuard implementation called <a href=\"/boringtun-userspace-wireguard-rust/\">BoringTun</a>.</p><p>The WARP application uses BoringTun to encrypt traffic from your device and send it directly to Cloudflare’s edge, ensuring that no one in between is snooping on what you&#39;re doing. If the site you are visiting is already a Cloudflare customer, the content is immediately sent down to your device. With WARP+, we use Argo Smart Routing to use the shortest path through our global network of data centers to reach whomever you are connecting to.</p><p>Combined with the power of <a href=\"https://one.one.one.one/\">1.1.1.1</a> (the <a href=\"https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers\">world&#39;s fastest</a> public DNS resolver), WARP keeps your traffic secure, private and fast. Since nearly everything you do on the Internet starts with a DNS request, choosing the fastest DNS server across all your devices will accelerate almost everything you do online.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"bringing-warp-to-linux\">Bringing WARP to Linux</h2>\n            <a href=\"#bringing-warp-to-linux\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>When we built out the foundations of our desktop client last year, we knew a Linux client was something we would deliver. If you have ever shipped software at this scale, you&#39;ll know that maintaining a client across all major operating systems is a daunting (and error-prone) task. To avoid these pitfalls, we wrote the core of the product in Rust, which allows for 95% of the code to be shared across platforms.</p><p>Internally we refer to this common code as the shared Daemon (or Service, for Windows folks), and it allows our engineers to spend less time duplicating code across multiple platforms while ensuring most quality improvements hit everyone at the same time. The really cool thing about this is that millions of existing WARP users have already helped us solidify the code base for Linux!</p><p>The other 5% of code is split into two main buckets: UI and quirks of the operating system. For now, we are forgoing a UI on Linux and instead working to support three distributions:</p><ul><li><p>Ubuntu</p></li><li><p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</p></li><li><p>CentOS</p></li></ul><p>We want to add more distribution support in the future, so if your favorite distro isn&#39;t there, don’t despair — the client may in fact already work with other Debian and Redhat based distributions, so please give it a try. If we missed your favorite distribution, we’d love to hear from you in our <a href=\"https://community.cloudflare.com/\">Community Forums</a>.</p><p>So without a UI — what&#39;s the mechanism for controlling WARP? The command line, of course! Keen observers may have noticed an executable that already ships with each client called the warp-cli. This platform-agnostic interface is already the preferred mechanism of interacting with the daemon by some of our engineers and is the main way you’ll interact with WARP on Linux.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"installing-cloudflare-warp-for-linux\">Installing Cloudflare WARP for Linux</h2>\n            <a href=\"#installing-cloudflare-warp-for-linux\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Seasoned Linux developers can jump straight to <a href=\"https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/install\">https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/install</a>.

You turn WARP on and all traffic from your device is encrypted to our edge. Through all releases of the client, we’ve kept that as a focus. One big switch to turn on and you are protected.</p><p>However, as we’ve grown, so have the requirements for our client. Earlier this year we released <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/split-tunnel\">split tunnel and local domain fallback</a> as a way for our Cloudflare for Teams customers to exclude certain routes from WARP. Our consumer customers may have noticed this stealthily added in the last release as well. We’ve heard from customers who want to deploy WARP in one additional mode: Single Applications. Today we are also announcing the ability for our customers to run WARP in a local proxy mode in all desktop clients.</p><p>When WARP is configured as a local proxy, only the applications that you configure to use the proxy (HTTPS or SOCKS5) will have their traffic sent through WARP. This allows you to pick and choose which traffic is encrypted (for instance, your web browser or a specific app), and everything else will be left open over the Internet.</p><p>Because this feature restricts WARP to just applications configured to use the local proxy, leaving all other traffic unencrypted over the Internet by default, we’ve hidden it in the advanced menu. To turn it on:</p><p>1. Navigate to Preferences -&gt; Advanced and click the Configure Proxy button.</p><p>2. On the dialog that opens, check the box and configure the port you want to listen on.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1Tg23RkaEOvIXBW6vKnDOM/b705f41410352a0948a0955465716506/image3-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"902\" height=\"472\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>3.
