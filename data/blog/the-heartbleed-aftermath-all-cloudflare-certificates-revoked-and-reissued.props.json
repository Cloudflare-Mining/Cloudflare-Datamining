We did not know then that CloudFlare was among the few to whom the bug was disclosed before the public announcement. In fact, we did not even know the bug&#39;s name. At that time we had simply removed TLS heartbeat functionality completely from OpenSSL by recompiling with the <code>OPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS</code> option.</p><p>After learning the full extent of the bug and that it had been live on the Internet for two years, we started an investigation to see whether our private keys and those of our customers were at risk.</p><p>We started our investigation by attempting to see what sort of information we could get through Heartbleed. We set up a test server on a local machine and bombarded it with Heartbleed attacks, saving the blocks of memory it returned. We scanned that memory for copies of the private key and after extensive scanning, we could not find a trace of it. Still, we were not fully convinced that it was impossible to do so we decided to crowdsource the problem by setting up the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflarechallenge.com/heartbleed\">CloudFlare Heartbleed Challenge</a>.</p><p>Nine hours into the challenge the first instance of the key <a href=\"https://twitter.com/indutny/status/454761620259225600\">was revealed on Twitter</a>. Over the five days of the challenge we saw over 75 million Heartbleed attacks against our server and 8,000 submissions.</p><p>The winners of the challenge used two different techniques in order to obtain the private key.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-the-private-key-leaks\">How the private key leaks</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-the-private-key-leaks\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>From <a href=\"https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/crypto/rsa/rsa_eay.c\">looking at the code</a> we knew that some pieces of the key are duplicated and manipulated during the computation of the private key operation. Following the code down into <a href=\"https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/crypto/bn/bn_div.c#L240\">bn_div.c</a> this code ends up making a copy of the divisor (in a modulus operation):</p><p>/* First we normalise the numbers */\nnorm_shift=BN_BITS2-((BN_num_bits(divisor))%BN_BITS2);\nif (!(BN_lshift(sdiv,divisor,norm_shift))) goto err;</p><p>The value stored in <code>sdiv</code> ends up remaining in memory until something overwrites it. The divisor is one of the two primes p and q needed for RSA. More on that below. But here&#39;s a diagram showing memory inside OpenSSL.

We are continuing to investigate and if a bug is found will submit a patch for OpenSSL.</p><p>The more HTTPS traffic the server serves, the more likely some of these intermediate values end up on the heap where Heartbleed can read them. Unfortunately for us, our test server was on our local machine and did not have a large amount of HTTPS traffic. This made it a lot less likely that we would find private keys in our experimental setting. The CloudFlare Challenge site was serving a lot of traffic, making key extraction more likely. There were some other tricks we learned from the winners about efficiently finding keys in memory. To explain these, we will go a bit into how RSA works.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-rsa-cryptosystem\">The RSA Cryptosystem</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-rsa-cryptosystem\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Key_generation\">RSA cryptosystem</a> is based on picking two prime numbers (which are habitually called p and q) and then using various mathematical properties of prime numbers to create a secure system. First a number n (called the modulus) is calculated. It is just p x q.</p><p>The other two vital values in RSA are called exponents and typically called e and d. In common RSA cryptosystems the number e is 65537. The public key is (n, e) (i.e. the modulus and the exponent e), the private key is (n, d) (i.e. the modulus and the exponent d). Of course, the prime numbers p and q also have to be kept secret because everything depends on them.</p><p>In textbook RSA, you can perform the private key operation with only d and n, but it&#39;s slow.</p><p>In OpenSSL, RSA’s private key operation also uses the primes p and q to speed up the private key operation using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_reduction\">Montgomery Arithemetic</a> and other tricks. If either p or q are found, they can be used to derive the private key d. Searching for p and q was the approach taken by most of the successful contestants of the challenge.</p><p>The most common trick for identifying the prime factors from random data was to take all blocks of data that match the size of a prime factor (128 bytes in the case of our 2,048 bit RSA key) and convert them to a number. Some contestants did a primality check to see if the number was prime or not, and some contestants tried to divide the number into the public modulus n. If the number turned out to be a prime factor, then it can be used to extract the private key d. This was the approach taken by Fedor Indutny as published on <a href=\"https://blog.indutny.com/9.heartbleed\">his blog</a>.</p><p>The second and slightly more elegant approach was taken by Rubin Xu. He started by attempting to find prime factors but quickly gave up on finding them. He then decided to use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith's_Attack\">Coppersmith&#39;s Attack</a> to derive the private exponent. In this attack, only pieces of the private key are needed and the private key is reconstructed mathematically. This attack is so efficient that he managed to extract the private key from only the first 50 dumps!</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-winners\">The Winners</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-winners\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Here are the winners of the challenge in order of when they found the private key:</p><ol><li><p>Fedor Indutny (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/indutny\">@indutny</a>) Developer</p></li><li><p>Ilkka Mattila, Information Security Adviser</p></li><li><p>Rubin Xu (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/xurubin\">@xurubin</a>), Security PhD Student</p></li><li><p>Ben Murphy (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/benmmurphy\">@benmmurphy</a>), Security Researcher</p></li><li><p>Steve Hunter (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/nonaxiomatic\">@nonaxiomatic</a>)</p></li><li><p>Xavier Martin (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/xav\">@xav</a>), Security Researcher</p></li><li><p>no name given</p></li><li><p>Jeremi Gosney (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/jmgosney\">@jmgosney</a>), CEO, Stricture Group</p></li><li><p>Michele Guerini Rocco (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/Rnhmjoj\">@Rnhmjoj</a>), Student</p></li><li><p>David Gervais (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/davidgervais\">@davidgervais</a>), Software Engineer</p></li><li><p>Christian Bürgi (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/buergich\">@buergich</a>)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Burkard (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/hiptomcat\">@hiptomcat</a>)</p></li><li><p>mancha</p></li><li><p>mwgamera</p></li></ol><p>A big congratulations goes out to all of them!</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-findings\">The Findings</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-findings\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Based on these findings, we believe that within two hours a dedicated attacker could retrieve a private key from a vulnerable server.
