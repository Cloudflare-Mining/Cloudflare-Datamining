	<p>Building a great customer experience is at the heart of any business. Building resilient products is half the battle — teams also need observability into their applications and services that are running across their stack.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare provides analytics and logs for our products in order to give our customers visibility to extract insights. Many of our customers use Cloudflare along with other applications and network services and want to be able to correlate data through all of their systems.</p>
	<p>Understanding normal traffic patterns, causes of latency and errors can be used to improve performance and ultimately the customer experience. For example, for websites behind Cloudflare, analyzing application logs and origin server logs along with Cloudflare’s HTTP request logs give our customers an end-to-end visibility about the journey of a request.</p>
	<p>We’re excited to have partnered with New Relic to create a direct integration that provides this visibility. The direct integration with our logging product, Logpush, means customers no longer need to pay for middleware to get their Cloudflare data into New Relic. The result is a faster log delivery and fewer costs for our mutual customers!</p>
	<p>We’ve invited the New Relic team to dig into how New Relic One can be used to provide insights into Cloudflare.</p>

	<p>New Relic provides an open, extensible, cloud-based observability platform that gives visibility into your entire stack. Logs, metrics, events, and traces are automatically correlated to help our customers improve user experience, accelerate time to market, and reduce MTTR.</p>
	<p>Deploying <a href="https://newrelic.com/products/log-management">log management</a> in context and at scale has never been faster, easier, or more attainable. With New Relic One, you can collect, search, and correlate logs and other telemetry data from applications, infrastructure, network devices, and more for faster troubleshooting and investigation.</p>
	<p>New Relic correlates events from your applications, infrastructure, serverless environments, along with mobile errors, traces and spans to your logs — so you find exactly what you need with less toil. All your logs are only a click away, so there’s no need to dig through logs in a separate etool to manually correlate them with errors and traces.</p>
	<p>See how engineers have used logs in New Relic to better serve their customers in the short video below.</p>
