	<p>Practically all data sent over the Internet today is at <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-quantum-menace/">risk </a>in the future if a sufficiently large and stable quantum computer is created. Anyone who captures data now could decrypt it.</p>
	<p>Luckily, there is a solution: we can switch to so-called <em>post-quantum (<strong>PQ</strong>) cryptography</em>, which is designed to be secure against attacks of quantum computers. After a six-year worldwide selection process, in July 2022, NIST <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise/">announced</a> they will standardize <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/index.shtml" target="_blank">Kyber</a>, a post-quantum key agreement scheme. The standard will be ready in 2024, but we want to help drive the adoption of post-quantum cryptography.</p>
	<p>Today we have added support for the <em>X25519Kyber512Draft00</em> and <em>X25519Kyber768Draft00</em> hybrid post-quantum key agreements to a number of test domains, including <a href="https://pq.cloudflareresearch.com/" target="_blank">pq.cloudflareresearch.com</a>.</p>
	<p><em>Do you want to experiment with post-quantum on your test website for free? Mail </em>[email protected]<em> to enroll your test website, but read the fine-print below.</em></p>
	<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-enable-post-quantum-on-your-website">What does it mean to enable post-quantum on your website?</h2>
	<p>If you enroll your website to the post-quantum beta, we will add support for these two extra key agreements <strong>alongside</strong> the existing classical encryption schemes such as X25519. If your browser doesn’t support these post-quantum key agreements (and none at the time of writing do), then your browser will continue working with a classically secure, but not quantum-resistant, connection.</p>
	<h3 id="then-how-to-test-it">Then how to test it?</h3>
	<p>We have open-sourced a fork of <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/boringssl-pq" target="_blank">BoringSSL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/go" target="_blank">Go</a> that has support for these post-quantum key agreements. With those and an enrolled test domain, you can check how your application performs with post-quantum key exchanges. We are working on support for more libraries and languages.</p>
	<h3 id="what-to-look-for">What to look for?</h3>
	<p>Kyber and classical key agreements such as X25519 have different performance characteristics: Kyber requires less computation, but has bigger keys and requires a bit more RAM to compute. It could very well make the connection faster if used on its own.</p>
	<p>We are not using Kyber on its own though, but are using <strong>hybrids</strong>. That means we are doing both an X25519 <em>and</em> Kyber key agreement such that the connection is still classically secure if either is broken. That also means that connections will be a bit slower. In our experiments, the difference is <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">very</a> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantumify-cloudflare/">small</a>, but it’s best to check for yourself.</p>
	<h2 id="the-fine-print">The fine-print</h2>
	<p>Cloudflare’s post-quantum cryptography support is a beta service for experimental use only. Enabling post-quantum on your website will subject the website to Cloudflare’s Beta Services terms and will impact other Cloudflare services on the website as described below.</p>
	<h3 id="no-stability-or-support-guarantees">No stability or support guarantees</h3>
	<p>Over the coming months, both Kyber and the way it’s integrated into TLS will change for several reasons, including:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Kyber will see small, but backward-incompatible changes in the coming months.</li>
		<li>We want to be compatible with other early adopters and will change our integration accordingly.</li>
		<li>As, together with the cryptography community, we find issues, we will add workarounds in our integration.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>We will update our forks accordingly, but cannot guarantee any long-term stability or continued support. PQ support may become unavailable at any moment. We will post updates on <a href="https://pq.cloudflareresearch.com" target="_blank">pq.cloudflareresearch.com</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="features-in-enrolled-domains">Features in enrolled domains</h3>
	<p>For the moment, we are running enrolled zones on a slightly different infrastructure for which not all features, notably QUIC, are available.</p>
	<p>With that out of the way, it’s…</p>

	<h3 id="boringssl">BoringSSL</h3>
	<p>With the following commands build our <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/boringssl-pq" target="_blank">fork of BoringSSL</a> and create a TLS connection with pq.cloudflareresearch.com using the compiled <code>bssl</code> tool. Note that we do not enable the post-quantum key agreements by default, so you have to pass the <code>-curves</code> flag.</p>

	<h3 id="on-the-wire">On the wire</h3>
	<p>So what does this look like on the wire? With <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> we can capture the packet flow. First a non-post quantum HTTP/2 connection with X25519:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/08/image1-8.png" class="kg-image"></figure>
	<p>This is a normal TLS 1.3 handshake: the client sends a ClientHello with an X25519 keyshare, which fits in a single packet. In return, the server sends its own 32 byte X25519 keyshare. It also sends various other messages, such as the certificate chain, which requires two packets in total.</p>
	<p>Let’s check out Kyber:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/08/image3-2.png" class="kg-image"></figure>
	<p>As you can see the ClientHello is a bit bigger, but still fits within a single packet. The response takes three packets now, instead of two, because of the larger server keyshare.</p>
	<h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h2>
	<p>Want to add client support yourself? We are using a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design-04.txt" target="_blank">hybrid</a> of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7748" target="_blank">X25519</a> and Kyber <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/data/kyber-specification-round3-20210804.pdf" target="_blank">version 3.02</a>. We are writing out the details of the latter in <a href="https://github.com/bwesterb/draft-schwabe-cfrg-kyber" target="_blank">version 00 of this CRFG IETF draft</a>, hence the name. We are using TLS <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-8" target="_blank">group identifiers</a> <code>0xfe30</code> and <code>0xfe31</code> for <em>X25519Kyber512Draft00</em> and <em>X25519Kyber768Draft00</em> respectively.</p>
	<p>There are some differences between our Go and BoringSSL forks that are interesting to compare.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Our <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/go" target="_blank">Go fork</a> uses our fast <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/tree/main/kem/kyber" target="_blank">AVX2 optimized implementation of Kyber</a> from <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-circl/">CIRCL</a>. In contrast, our BoringSSL fork uses the simpler <a href="https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/tree/master/ref" target="_blank">portable reference implementation</a>. Without the AVX2 optimisations it’s easier to evaluate. The downside is that it’s slower. Don’t be mistaken: it is still very fast, but you can check yourself.</li>
		<li>Our Go fork only sends one keyshare. If the server doesn’t support it, it will respond with a HelloRetryRequest message and the client will fallback to one the server does support. This adds a roundtrip.<br>Our BoringSSL fork, on the other hand, will send two keyshares: the post-quantum hybrid and a classical one (if a classical key agreement is still enabled). If the server doesn’t recognize the first, it will be able to use the second. In this way we avoid a roundtrip if the server does not support the post-quantum key agreement.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
	<p>The quantum future is here. In the coming years the Internet will move to post-quantum cryptography. Today we are offering our customers the tools to get a headstart and test post-quantum key agreements. We love to hear your feedback: e-mail it to [email protected].</p>
	<p>This is just a small, but important first step. We will continue our efforts to move towards a secure and private quantum-secure Internet. Much more to come — watch this space.</p>
