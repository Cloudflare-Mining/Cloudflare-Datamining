We thought it was worth sharing with a wider audience.</p><p>Date: Thu, 10 Jul 2014 10:24:21 +0100\nSubject: Courage to change things\nFrom: John Graham-Cumming\nTo: Everyone</p><p>Folks,</p><p>At the Q3 planning meeting I started by making some remarks about how much\ncode we are changing at CloudFlare. I understand that there were audio\nproblems and people may not have heard these clearly, so I&#39;m just going to\nreiterate them in writing.</p><p>One of the things that CloudFlare is being brave about is looking at old code\nand deciding to rewrite it. Lots of companies live with legacy code and build\non it and it eventuallybecomes a maintenance nightmare and slows the company\ndown.</p><p>Over the last year we&#39;ve made major strides in rewriting parts of our code\nbase so that they are faster, more maintainable, and easier to enhance. There\nare many parts of the Q3 roadmap that include replacing old parts of our\nstack. This is incredibly important as it enables us to be more agile and\nmore stable in future.</p><p>We should feel good about this.</p><p>We&#39;re not just rewriting so that engineers have fun with new stuff, we&#39;re\nmaking things better across the board. Many, many companies don&#39;t have the\ncourage to rewrite; even fewer have the courage to do things we&#39;ve done like\nwrite a brand new DNS server or replace our core request handling\nfunctionality.</p><p>We should also not feel bad about this either: it&#39;s not a sign that we did\nthings wrong in the first place. We operate in a very fast moving environment.\nThat&#39;s the nature of a start-up. As we grow our requirements change (we have\nmore sites on us, more traffic, more variety and more ideas) and so our code\nneeds to.</p><p>So don&#39;t be surprised by items on the roadmap that talk about replacing code.\nLike a well maintained aircraft we take CloudFlare&#39;s code in for regular\nmaintenance and change what&#39;s worn.</p><p>John.</p><p>Want to help out write new code and replace the old? We&#39;rere <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/\">hiring</a> in San Francisco and London.</p>",
