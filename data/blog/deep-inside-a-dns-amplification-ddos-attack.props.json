These attacks are some of the largest, as measured by the number of Gigabits per second (Gbps), that we see directed toward our network. For the last three weeks, one persistent attacker has been sending at least 20Gbps twenty-four hours a day as an attack against one of our customers.</p><p>That size of an attack is enough to cripple even a large web host. For CloudFlare, the nature of our network means that the attack, which gets diluted across all of our <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/network-map\">global data centers</a>, doesn&#39;t cause us harm. Even from a cost perspective, the attack doesn&#39;t end up adding to our bandwidth bill because of the way in which we&#39;re charged for wholesale bandwidth.</p><p>We buy a lot of bandwidth and we pay for the higher of our ingress (in-bound) or egress (out-bound) averaged over a month. Since we act as a caching proxy, under normal circumstances egress always exceeds ingress. When there&#39;s an attack, the two lines get closer together but rarely is an attack large enough to add to our overall bandwidth costs.</p><p>Given that the latest attack wasn&#39;t impacting us or any of our customers, we decided to let it run for a while and see what we could learn.</p><h3>Amplification Attacks</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/\">DNS Amplification Attacks</a> are a way for an attacker to magnify the amount of bandwidth they can target at a potential victim. Imagine you are an attacker and you control a botnet capable of sending out 100Mbps of traffic. While that may be sufficient to knock some sites offline, it is a relatively trivial amount of traffic in the world of DDoS. In order to increase your attack&#39;s volume, you could try and add more compromised machines to your botnet. That is becoming increasingly difficult. Alternatively, you could find a way to amplify your 100Mbps into something much bigger.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7KWlUrWlV2lKDfXcF659H8/0fd177d8fa4ac37557beea9f44681ecc/jokey_smurf_attack.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"Deep Inside a DNS Amplification DDoS Attack\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The original amplification attack was known as a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/smurf-ddos-attack/\">SMURF attack</a>. A SMURF attack involves an attacker sending <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/\">ICMP</a> requests (i.e., ping requests) to the network&#39;s broadcast address (i.e., X.X.X.255) of a router configured to relay ICMP to all devices behind the router. The attacker spoofs the source of the ICMP request to be the IP address of the intended victim. Since ICMP does not include a handshake, the destination has no way of verifying if the source IP is legitimate. The router receives the request and passes it on to all the devices that sit behind it. All those devices then respond back to the ping. The attacker is able to amplify the attack by a multiple of how ever many devices are behind the router (i.e., if you have 5 devices behind the router then the attacker is able to amplify the attack 5x, see the diagram below).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3O75rdntqtBWfPBJewha1g/28625f3614343d3940564a863cc86c67/smurf_attack_diagram.png.scaled500.png\" alt=\"Deep Inside a DNS Amplification DDoS Attack\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"276\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>SMURF attacks are largely a thing of the past. For the most part, network operators have configured their routers to not relay ICMP requests sent to a network&#39;s broadcast address. However, even as that amplification attack vector has closed, others remain wide open.</p><h3>DNS Amplification</h3><p>There are two criteria for a good amplification attack vector: 1) query can be set with a spoofed source address (e.g., via a protocol like ICMP or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/\">UDP</a> that does not require a handshake); and 2) the response to the query is significantly larger than the query itself. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/\">DNS</a> is a core, ubiquitous Internet platform that meets these criteria and therefore has become the largest source of amplification attacks.</p><p>DNS queries are typically transmitted over UDP, meaning that, like ICMP queries used in a SMURF attack, they are fire and forget. As a result, their source attribute can be spoofed and the receiver has no way of determining its veracity before responding. DNS also is capable of generating a much larger response than query. For example, you can send the following (tiny) query (where x.x.x.x is the IP of an open DNS resolver):</p><p>dig ANY isc.org @x.x.x.x</p><p>And get back the following (gigantic) response:</p><p>; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.7.3 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; ANY isc.org @x.x.x.x\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; Got answer:\n;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 5147\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 27, AUTHORITY: 4, ADDITIONAL: 5</p><p>;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;isc.org.

In other words, if you&#39;re running a recursive DNS server for your company and your company&#39;s IP space is 5.5.5.0/24 (i.e., 5.5.5.0 - 5.5.5.255) then it should only respond to queries from that range. If a queryarrives from 9.9.9.9 then it should not respond.</p><p>The problem is, many people running DNS resolvers leave them open and willing to respond to any IP address that queries them. This is a known problem that is at least 10 years old. What has happened recently is a number of distinct <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-botnet/\">botnets</a> appear to have enumerated the Internet&#39;s IP space in order to discover open resolvers. Once discovered, they can be used to launch significant DNS Amplification Attacks.</p><p>If you look at the geographic data on attack origins, the US dominates the list, but that is largely skewed by the number of networks present within the country. Per capita, the worst country is Taiwan where the country&#39;s HINET is the second largest source of open resolvers of any network in the world. We&#39;ve also published a <a href=\"http://graphs.peskey.info/dns-networks.txt\">list of the top networks from which we&#39;re seeing abused open DNS resolvers</a>.

While we&#39;re reluctant to publish the list of the actual IP address of the open resolvers for fear that they may be misused, if you are one of the operators of one of the networks listed above, we&#39;re happy to share data with you in order to help you get your network cleaned up. Organizations such as Team Cymru publish <a href=\"http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/Resolvers/\">more extensive lists</a> and also work withnetwork operators to get their networks cleaned up.</p><p>If you are running an open recursor, you should close it now. Leaving it open means you will continue to aid in these attacks. If you&#39;re running BIND, you can include one or more of the following in your configuration file in order to limit attackers abusing your network:</p><p>// Disable recursion for the DNS service\n//options {    recursion no;};</p><p>// Permit DNS queries for DNS messages with source addresses\n// in the 192.168.1.0/24 netblock. The &#39;allow-query-cache&#39;\n// options configuration can also be used to limit the IP\n// addresses permitted to obtain answers from the cache of\n// the DNS server. Substitute with your own network range.\n//options {    allow-query {192.168.1.0/24;};};</p><p>CloudFlare itself is designed to automatically learn from the traffic to our network, whether the traffic is good or bad. While this size of attack would be crippling for most networks, it has been relatively trivial for us to identify the sources of the attack, route them so they don&#39;t affect any of our customers, and study their behavior over the last three weeks. Now that we&#39;ve enumerated the sources of the attack, we&#39;ve begun to null route the traffic upstream to fully neuter the attack.</p><p>We will continue to work with the networks listed above in order to get their networks cleaned up. And, as new threats emerge, we&#39;ll continue to share information on them in order to ensure the Internet can remain fast and safe.</p>",
