Through invaluable mentorship, continuous learning, and the chance to make a real-world impact, our summer was truly enriched at every step.

To give you a glimpse of our summer, here are a few that showcase the breadth and depth of our experiences.</p><p><b>Mia M., Product Manager intern,</b> worked on the Cloudflare Secrets Store, which is a new product that will allow Cloudflare customers to store, encrypt, and deploy sensitive data across the product suite. She focused on creating requirements for the core platform and tackling the first milestone, bringing secrets and environment variables from the per-Worker level to the account level in the Workers platform.</p><p><b>Pierre, Research intern,</b> focused on integrating differential privacy—a layer of protection with formal privacy guarantees—into distributed aggregation protocols. This privacy layer is imperative for user trust and data security as these protocols are commonly used for collecting sensitive information, such as browser telemetry or health data.</p><p><b>Johnny, Software Engineer intern</b>, worked on a new feature for API Shield called Object-Level Access Policies as a first step in a solution to combat Broken Object-Level Authorization, which has been ranked as the #1 API Security flaw by OWASP. This feature will enable customers to specify explicit allowlists and blocklists for API traffic per object.</p><p><b>Olivia, Project Manager intern,</b> led the Dissatisfied (DSAT) Customer Outreach Project and JIRA Automations for the Customer Support team. The DSAT project involves reaching out to Premium customers who express dissatisfaction with the goal of providing personalized contact to ensure they feel valued. The JIRA Automation project aims to create zero-touch tickets, removing Customer Support as the middle man.</p><p>Also don’t forget to check out the amazing intern projects that got featured in a blog post!</p><p><b>Emilie, Software Engineering intern</b> introduced a <a href=\"/debug-queues-from-dash/\">debugging feature for Cloudflare Queues</a>.</p><p><b>Joaquin, Software Engineer intern</b> added a <a href=\"/cloudflare-workers-database-integration-with-upstash/\">new Workers Database integration</a>.</p><p><b>Austin, Software Engineer intern</b> created <a href=\"/introducing-scheduled-deletion-for-cloudflare-stream/\">scheduled deletion for Cloudflare Stream</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5GjXDOjR12QZdJS1J5Ey53/3382bed549140ffe2a350bb74892b21b/Introducing-the-2023-Intern-ets-body-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"493\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"no-null-days-here\">No null days here!</h2>\n      <a href=\"#no-null-days-here\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Beyond our projects, we had tons of fun getting to meet other Cloudflarians and experience the vibrant Cloudflare culture.

Below you can see us holding up our favorite snacks from the box!</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5A3F9KPae2jxzjshJsteXl/3a0139eff7f2eb769f94ebf1550c4070/Frame-2--10-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1052\" height=\"671\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Meanwhile, the on-site interns couldn&#39;t get enough of the office snacks. Favorites? Pita chips, Lucky Charms, chocolate almonds, coconut chocolate bars and coconut water. Plus, the Austin and San Francisco offices even have a Sour Patch Kids dispenser! Snack on!</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"surprises\">Surprises</h2>\n      <a href=\"#surprises\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Every day at Cloudflare presented unexpected joys and challenges.

But my colleagues always showed concern for how I was feeling and how things were going, and I couldn&#39;t be more grateful for that.”</p><p><b>Industry vs Academia: Johnny</b> mentioned “coming from academia, I was amazed by the amount of effort that has been, and is continuing to be, put into the products to really productionize what I have only before seen in research. It is another reminder of the scale in which we work!”</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"by-the-numbers\">By the numbers</h2>\n      <a href=\"#by-the-numbers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Here are some fun stats from our internship…</p><ul><li><p><b>Johnny</b> drove 30 hours from New York to Colorado</p></li><li><p><b>Maximo</b> missed 0 days of going to the Austin office</p></li><li><p><b>Anni</b> drank 86 matcha lattes this summer</p></li><li><p><b>Emilie</b> participated in 38 Cloudfriends calls and coffee chats</p></li><li><p><b>Simon</b> has waited around one week cumulatively for builds to finish</p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"exit-0\">exit(0)</h3>\n      <a href=\"#exit-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>At Cloudflare, our internships aren’t just about work—they&#39;re about growth, mentorship, and real impact.
