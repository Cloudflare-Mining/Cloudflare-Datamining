As we joined both remotely and in-person across Cloudflare’s global offices, our experiences spanned a variety of roles from engineering, product management to internal auditing and marketing. Through invaluable mentorship, continuous learning, and the chance to make a real-world impact, our summer was truly enriched at every step.

To give you a glimpse of our summer, here are a few that showcase the breadth and depth of our experiences.</p><p><b>Mia M., Product Manager intern,</b> worked on the Cloudflare Secrets Store, which is a new product that will allow Cloudflare customers to store, encrypt, and deploy sensitive data across the product suite. She focused on creating requirements for the core platform and tackling the first milestone, bringing secrets and environment variables from the per-Worker level to the account level in the Workers platform.</p><p><b>Pierre, Research intern,</b> focused on integrating differential privacy—a layer of protection with formal privacy guarantees—into distributed aggregation protocols. This privacy layer is imperative for user trust and data security as these protocols are commonly used for collecting sensitive information, such as browser telemetry or health data.</p><p><b>Johnny, Software Engineer intern</b>, worked on a new feature for API Shield called Object-Level Access Policies as a first step in a solution to combat Broken Object-Level Authorization, which has been ranked as the #1 API Security flaw by OWASP. This feature will enable customers to specify explicit allowlists and blocklists for API traffic per object.</p><p><b>Olivia, Project Manager intern,</b> led the Dissatisfied (DSAT) Customer Outreach Project and JIRA Automations for the Customer Support team. The DSAT project involves reaching out to Premium customers who express dissatisfaction with the goal of providing personalized contact to ensure they feel valued. The JIRA Automation project aims to create zero-touch tickets, removing Customer Support as the middle man.</p><p>Also don’t forget to check out the amazing intern projects that got featured in a blog post!</p><p><b>Emilie, Software Engineering intern</b> introduced a <a href=\"/debug-queues-from-dash/\">debugging feature for Cloudflare Queues</a>.</p><p><b>Joaquin, Software Engineer intern</b> added a <a href=\"/cloudflare-workers-database-integration-with-upstash/\">new Workers Database integration</a>.</p><p><b>Austin, Software Engineer intern</b> created <a href=\"/introducing-scheduled-deletion-for-cloudflare-stream/\">scheduled deletion for Cloudflare Stream</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5GjXDOjR12QZdJS1J5Ey53/cab902e84a5154b1590d012b537e1479/Introducing-the-2023-Intern-ets-body-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"493\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"no-null-days-here\">No null days here!</h2>\n            <a href=\"#no-null-days-here\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Beyond our projects, we had tons of fun getting to meet other Cloudflarians and experience the vibrant Cloudflare culture.
