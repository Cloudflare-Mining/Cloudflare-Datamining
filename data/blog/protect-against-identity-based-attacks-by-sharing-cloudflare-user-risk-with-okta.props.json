In particular, security teams struggle with multiple siloed tools that fail to share risk data effectively with each other, leading to excessive manual effort to extract signals from the noise. To address this complexity, Cloudflare launched <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/unified-risk-posture/\"><u>risk posture management capabilities</u></a> earlier this year to make it easier for organizations to accomplish three key jobs on one platform: </p><ol><li><p>Evaluating risk posed by people by using first-party <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-ueba/\"><u>user entity and behavior analytics (UEBA)</u></a> models</p></li><li><p>Exchanging risk telemetry with best-in-class security tools, and</p></li><li><p>Enforcing risk controls based on those dynamic first- and third-party risk scores.</p></li></ol><p>Today’s announcement builds on these capabilities (particularly job #2) and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners/okta/\"><u>our partnership with Okta</u></a> by enabling organizations to share Cloudflare’s real-time <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf1-user-risk-score/\"><u>user risk scores</u></a> with Okta, which can then automatically enforce policies based on that user’s risk. In this way, organizations can adapt to evolving risks in less time with less manual effort.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"cloudflares-user-risk-scoring\">Cloudflare’s user risk scoring</h2>\n            <a href=\"#cloudflares-user-risk-scoring\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf1-user-risk-score/\"><u>Introduced earlier this year</u></a>, Cloudflare’s user risk scoring analyzes real-time telemetry of user activities and behaviors and assigns a risk score of high, medium, or low.

Instances of risky behavior are called Risk Events. We perform two actions when we observe a Risk Event: logging the event and evaluating whether further action is required. For customers that have enabled <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/risk-score/#send-risk-score-to-okta\"><u>Risk Score Sharing with Okta</u></a>, any change in Risk Score is transmitted to Okta’s Identity Threat Protection (ITP).</p><p>Upon receiving a new event, Okta evaluates the change in user risk against the organization&#39;s policies. These policies may include actions such as re-authenticating the user if they become high risk.</p><p>When we design new features, we aim for them to be extensible across the industry. For this reason, we chose the <a href=\"https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0.html\"><u>OpenID Shared Signals Framework Specification (SSF)</u></a> to be the foundation of our transmission format. By doing this, we are able to leverage current and future providers that support the standard. The core functionality of SSF revolves around sharing <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8417.html\"><u>Security Event Tokens (SETs)</u></a>, a specialized version of a JSON Web Token (JWT). Providers can produce and consume Security Event Tokens, forming a “network” of shared user risk information between providers.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/SaWKy4UWPZfa8hf6rHcF8/571a08ddeab08b01b9a38e740ec89644/image2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n          </figure><p><sup><b><i>Figure 2.</i></b></sup><sup><i> Diagram showing a Security Event Token being transmitted from Cloudflare to Okta.</i></sup></p><p>The diagram above (<b>Figure 2</b>) details the process of sharing risk. When sharing Risk Score changes with Okta, we bundle metadata about the risk event and user into the body of a Security Event Token. Following this, the JWT/SET is signed using our private key. This is an important step, as the signature is used to verify the sender&#39;s identity (cryptographic authenticity) and that the payload body has not been tampered with (cryptographic integrity). In plain terms, this signature is used by Okta to verify that the event is unaltered and was sent by Cloudflare.</p><p>Once Okta has verified the authenticity and integrity of the SET token, they may use the risk metadata within the body to execute Identity Threat Protection policies defined by the customer. These policies could include actions such as “if a high risk score is received from Cloudflare, sign out the offending user”.</p><p>Learn more about the Shared Signals Framework and CAEP in <a href=\"https://www.okta.com/blog/2024/08/identity-threat-protection-with-okta-ai/\"><u>Okta’s announcement blog post</u></a>.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"get-started-today\">Get started today</h2>\n            <a href=\"#get-started-today\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Cloudflare customers can easily <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/risk-score/#send-risk-score-to-okta\"><u>enable risk score sharing from the Cloudflare One SSO setup page</u></a>.

With vast amounts of data — including user logins, logouts, websites visited, and emails sent — human analysts would struggle to keep pace with modern security challenges. Cloudflare provides context in the form of a risk score, enabling Okta’s risk engine to make more informed policy decisions about users. This sharing of information powers the continuous evaluation required to enforce Zero Trust policies within your organization, ultimately strengthening your organization’s security posture.</p><p>Not yet a Cloudflare One customer? <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/plans/enterprise/\"><u>Reach out for a consultation</u></a> or contact your account manager.</p>",
