This bug caused repeated, unnecessary calls to the Tenant Service API. The API calls were managed by a React useEffect hook, but we mistakenly included a problematic object in its dependency array. Because this object was recreated on every state or prop change, React treated it as “always new,” causing the useEffect to re-run each time. As a result, the API call executed many times during a single dashboard render instead of just once. This behavior coincided with a service update to the Tenant Service API, compounding instability and ultimately overwhelming the service, which then failed to recover.</p><p>When the Tenant Service became overloaded, it had an impact on other APIs and the dashboard because Tenant Service is part of our API request authorization logic.  Without Tenant Service, API request authorization can not be evaluated.  When authorization evaluation fails, API requests return 5xx status codes.</p><p>We’re very sorry about the disruption.  The rest of this blog goes into depth on what happened, and what steps we are taking to prevent it from happening again.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2>\n      <a href=\"#timeline\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <table><tr><th><p>Time (UTC)</p></th><th><p>Description</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>2025-09-12 16:32</p></td><td><p>A new version of the Cloudflare Dashboard is released which contains a bug that will trigger many more calls to the /organizations endpoint, including retries in the event of failure.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2025-09-12 17:50</p></td><td><p>A new version of the Tenant API Service is deployed.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2025-09-12 17:57</p></td><td><p>The Tenant API Service becomes overwhelmed as new versions are deploying.

We theorized that these were responsible for the ongoing Dashboard availability issues and made a patch to the service with the expectation that it would improve the API health and restore the dashboard to a healthy state. Ultimately this change degraded service further and was quickly reverted. The second outage can be seen in the graph above.</p><p>It’s painful to have an outage like this.  That said, there were a few things that helped lessen the impact.  Our automatic alerting service quickly identified the correct people to join the call and start working on remediation.  Additionally, this was a failure in the control plane which has strict separation of concerns from the data plane.  Thus, the outage did not affect services on Cloudflare’s network.  The majority of users at Cloudflare were unaffected unless they were making configuration changes or using our dashboard.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"going-forward\">Going forward</h2>\n      <a href=\"#going-forward\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We believe it’s important to learn from our mistakes and this incident is an opportunity to make some improvements.  Those improvements can be categorized as either ways to reduce / eliminate the impact of a similar change or as improvements to our observability tooling to better inform the team during future events.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"reducing-impact\">Reducing impact</h3>\n      <a href=\"#reducing-impact\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We use Argo Rollouts for releasing, which monitors deployments for errors and automatically rolls back that service on a detected error.  We’ve been migrating our services over to Argo Rollouts but have not yet updated the Tenant Service to use it.  Had it been in place, we would have automatically rolled back the second Tenant Service update limiting the second outage.  This work had already been scheduled by the team and we’ve increased the priority of the migration.</p><p>When we restarted the Tenant Service, everyone’s dashboard began to re-authenticate with the API.  This caused the API to become unstable again causing issues with everyone’s dashboard.  This pattern is a common one often referred to as a Thundering Herd.  Once a resource or service is made available, everyone tries to use it all at once.
