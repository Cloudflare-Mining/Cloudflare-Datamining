Both are the brain children of Daniel J. Bernstein (DJB). ChaCha20 is based upon an earlier cipher developed by DJB called Salsa, that dates back to 2005, and was submitted to the eSTREAM competition. ChaCha20 itself was published in 2008. It slightly modifies the Salsa round, and the number 20 indicates that it repeats for 20 rounds in total. Similar to AES-CTR, ChaCha20 is a stream cipher. It generates a pseudo-random stream of bits from an incremented counter, the stream is then &quot;XORed&quot; with plaintext to encrypt it (or &quot;XORed&quot; with ciphertext to decrypt). Because you do not need to know the plaintext in advance to generate the stream, this approach allows both to be very efficient and parallelizable. ChaCha20 is a 256-bit cipher.</p><p>Poly1305 was published in 2004. Poly1305 is a MAC, and can be used with any encrypted or unencrypted message, to generate a keyed authentication token. The purpose of such tokens is to guarantee the integrity of a given message. Originally Poly1305 used AES as the underlying cipher (Poly1305-AES); now it uses ChaCha20. Again, similarly to GHASH, it is a polynomial evaluation hash. Unlike GHASH, its key changes for each new message, because it depends on the IV. When DJB developed this MAC, he made it especially suited for efficient execution on the floating point hardware present on the CPUs back then. Today it is much more efficient to execute using 64-bit integer instructions, and might have been designed slightly differently.</p><p>Both have received considerable scrutiny from the crypto community in the years since, and today are considered completely safe, albeit there is a concern about the <a href=\"http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2016-March/028824.html\">monoculture</a> that forms when one person is responsible for so many standards in the industry (DJB is also responsible for Curve25519 key exchange).</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"from-zero-to-hero\">From zero to hero</h3>\n      <a href=\"#from-zero-to-hero\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The body that governs internet standards is the IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force.

The current version incorporated the TLS records sequence number into the IV generation, making it more resistant to dangerous IV reuse.</p><p>The second difference relates to how Poly1305 applies to the TLS record. Records are the equivalent of a TCP packet for TLS. When data is streamed over TLS, it is broken into many smaller records. Each record holds part of the data (encrypted), with the MAC calculated for that record. It also holds other information, such as the protocol version, record type and length. The maximum amount of data a single record can hold is 16KB.</p><p>The draft Poly1305 calculated the hash of the additional data, followed by the length of the additional data as an 8 byte string, followed by the ciphertext, followed by the length of the ciphertext as an 8 byte string. In the current iteration, the hash is generated over the additional data, padded with zeroes to 16 byte boundary, followed by ciphertext similarly padded with zeroes, followed by the length of the additional data as an 8 byte string, followed by the length of the ciphertext as an 8 byte string.</p><p>The older cipher suites can be identified by IDs {cc}{13}, {cc}{14} and {cc}{15}, while the newer cipher suites have IDs {cc}{a8} through {cc}{ae}.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"future-of-chacha20-poly1305\">Future of ChaCha20-Poly1305</h3>\n      <a href=\"#future-of-chacha20-poly1305\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Today we already see that almost 20% of all the request to sites using CloudFlare use <a href=\"/padding-oracles-and-the-decline-of-cbc-mode-ciphersuites/\">ChaCha20-Poly1305</a>.

ChaCha20-Poly1305 allows for highly efficient implementation using SIMD instructions. Most of our servers are based on Intel CPUs with 256-bit SIMD extensions called AVX2. We utilize those to get the maximal performance.</p><p>The main competition for ChaCha20-Poly1305 are the AES-GCM based cipher suites. The most widely used AES-GCM, uses AES with 128 bit key, however in terms of security AES-256 is more comparable to ChaCha20.</p><p>Usually cipher performance numbers are reported for large messages, to show asymptotic performance, but on our network we started using <a href=\"https://istlsfastyet.com/\">dynamic record sizing</a>. In practice it means many connections will never reach the maximal size of a TLS record (16KB), but instead will use significantly smaller records (below 1400 bytes). The records dynamically grow as the connection progresses, scaling to about 4KB and eventually to 16KB. Most messages will also not fit precisely into a record, and all sizes are possible.</p><p>Below are two graphs, comparing the performance of our ChaCha20-Poly1305 to the implementation in OpenSSL 1.1.0 pre, and to AES-GCM. The performance is reported in CPU cycles per byte, for a plaintext of given length, when performing the &quot;seal&quot; operation on a given plaintext with 13 bytes of AD, similarly to TLS. The first graph covers sizes 64-1536, while the second covers the remaining sizes to 16KB.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4aCgzCF31FBk2y2x6JALC6/2bcdb455449826306a0ac7997a7947ac/image01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"754\" height=\"327\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>CPU cycles per byte (Y-axis) vs. record size in bytes (X-axis)</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/67MyIu3q0slgs053DHqy6L/c3bca79b186604388233fe17fbe435d3/image00.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"754\" height=\"327\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>CPU cycles per byte (Y-axis) vs. record size in bytes (X-axis)</p><p>We can see that our implementation significantly outperforms OpenSSL for short records, and is slightly faster for longer records. The average performance advantage is 7%. AES-128-GCM and AES-256-GCM both still beat ChaCha20-Poly1305 in pure performance for records larger than 320 bytes, but getting below 2 cycles/byte is a major performance achievement. Not many modes can beat this performance. It is also important to note that AES-GCM uses two dedicated CPU instructions (AESENC and CLMULQDQ), whereas both ChaCha and Poly only use the generic SIMD instructions.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"performance-outlook\">Performance outlook</h3>\n      <a href=\"#performance-outlook\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>The current performance is outstanding.
