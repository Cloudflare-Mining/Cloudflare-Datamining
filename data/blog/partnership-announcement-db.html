	<p>Cloudflare Workers is the easiest way for developers to deploy their application’s code with performance, scale and security baked in. No configuration necessary. Worker code scales to serve billions of requests close to your users across Cloudflare’s 200+ data centers.</p>
	<p>But that’s not the only interesting problem we need to solve. Every application has two parts: code and state.</p>
	<p>State isn’t always the easiest to work in a massive distributed system. When an application runs in 200+ data centers simultaneously, there’s an inherent tradeoff between distributing the data for better performance, availability, scale, and guaranteeing that all data centers see the same data at a given point in time.</p>
	<p>Our goal is to make state at the edge seamless. We started that journey with Workers KV, which provides low-latency access to globally distributed data. We’re since added Durable Objects, with strong consistency and the ability to design coordination patterns on top of Workers. We’re continuing to invest in and build out these products.</p>
	<p>However, some use cases aren’t easily implemented with Workers KV or Durable Objects. Think querying complex datasets, or communicating with an existing system-of-record. Even if we built this functionality ourselves, there will always be customers who want to use a different tool for data storage and access.</p>
	<p>Today, we’re making our data strategy clear so that developers can build on Workers with confidence. First, we’re announcing a partnership with two distributed data companies, Macrometa and Fauna, to help developers choose an edge-first database when they build a new application on Workers. Next, we’ve introduced tutorials and guides for databases that already support HTTP connections to make connecting to existing databases even easier.</p>
	<p>With this, the Workers runtime is the easiest way to handle both parts of your application that matter: code and state.</p>

	<p>Cloudflare is excited to announce a partnership for global data with <a href="https://www.macrometa.com/cloudflare">Macrometa</a>. Macrometa provides a serverless data platform for developers to build rich, geo-distributed, stateful applications on the edge with Cloudflare Workers. The Macrometa Global Data Network (GDN) is an ultra-fast, globally replicated noSQL database with integrated features for search, pub/sub, streams, and stream processing.</p>
	<p>Macrometa complements Cloudflare Workers by enabling stateful functions to run, store, query, mutate, and serve data globally with local read/write latencies. Tables replicate across Macrometa’s global data centers with configurable consistency and without additional code, cost, or complexity. Data calls between Workers and Macrometa are automatically routed and served from the closest Macrometa region relative to the Cloudflare Worker invocation. <i>We have seen that end-to-end latency for a database request from a client to the edge and back is &lt;75ms for 99th percentile.</i></p>
	<p>Macrometa combines typically disparate data services and APIs (each with their own data model and copy of data) into a single, integrated, and intuitive data API (with a single, unified common data set and model). At a high level, one can think of Macrometa as combining a noSQL database together with pub/sub, streaming data and event processing along with search into a seamless, globally replicated, low latency data platform.</p>
	<p>The following multimodal interfaces are available to the developer via a SQL-like query language:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Key/value database with high write performance, low latencies, and Time to Live (TTL) support</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>JSON document database with a SQL-like query language</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Graph database for storing and retrieving relationships between entities</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>DynamoDB API compatible database</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Low latency edge cache for database and API results with global cache invalidation and Time to Live (TTL)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Search</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Pub/Sub &amp; queues with Kafka, Pulsar and MQTT message compatibility</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Streaming data and complex event processing - evaluate events, aggregate, enrich, filter, summarize, pattern match on stream data in real time.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Apps written using Cloudflare Workers consume Macrometa via a JavaScript SDK or REST API. Developers have a choice of using one of two SDKs tightly integrated with Cloudflare Workers:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>A Cloudflare Worker specific <a href="https://github.com/Macrometacorp/jsC8">JavaScript SDK</a> which provides the full set of capabilities mentioned above</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>The Dynamo <a href="https://github.com/Macrometacorp/mmdynamo">client SDK</a> that enables developers to use Macrometa as a drop-in replacement AWS DynamoDB (or as an edge cache).</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>To showcase the power and performance of Cloudflare and Macrometa together, we re-built AWS’s demo application — a complete E-Commerce backend that serves an online bookstore. eCommerce backends for large global sites are complex and require many different types of databases. These complex architectures are necessary to store, perform multi-table or multi-data store queries, and serve product catalogs, pricing, search, recommendations, order management, cart operations, fulfillment, etc.</p>
	<p>The bookstore is a serverless app built as a Cloudflare Worker to serve a React single page application and uses Macrometa for storing and serving product/catalog data, orders, cart operations, etc. It uses streams and complex event processing to provide a real-time leaderboard of the top-selling books and uses the Macrometa search service to deliver near-instant search results. You can test drive the end-user experience <a href="https://bookstore.macrometadev.workers.dev">here</a>. Our tests show orders of magnitude latency improvement for a user vs. the same use case built on a legacy cloud provider.</p>
