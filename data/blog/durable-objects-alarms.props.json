The Durable Object associated with each ID implements some fundamental component of an application — a banking application might have a Durable Object representing each bank account, for example. The bank account object would then expose methods for incrementing a balance, transferring money or any other actions that the application needs to do on the bank account.</p><p>Durable Objects work well as a stateful backend for applications — while Workers can instantiate a new instance of your code in any of Cloudflare’s data centers in response to a request, Durable Objects guarantee that all requests for a given Durable Object will reach the same instance on Cloudflare’s network.</p><p>Each Durable Object is single-threaded and has access to a stateful storage API, making it easy to build consistent and highly-available distributed applications on top of them.</p><p>This system makes distributed systems’ development easier — we’ve seen some impressive applications launched atop Durable Objects, from collaborative whiteboarding tools to conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) systems for coordinating distributed state launch.</p><p>However, up until now, there’s been a piece missing — how do you invoke a Durable Object when a client Worker is not making requests to it?</p><p>As with any distributed system, Durable Objects can become unavailable and stop running. Perhaps the machine you were running on was unplugged, or the datacenter burned down and is never coming back, or an individual object exceeded its memory limit and was reset. Before today, a subsequent request would reinitialize the Durable Object on another machine, but there was no way to programmatically wake up an Object.</p><p>Durable Objects Alarms are here to change that, unlocking new use cases for Durable Objects like queues and deferred processing.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"what-is-a-durable-object-alarm\">What is a Durable Object Alarm?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#what-is-a-durable-object-alarm\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Durable Object Alarms allow you, from within your Durable Object, to schedule the object to be woken up at a time in the future.

From anywhere else in your Durable Object, call <code>state.storage.setAlarm()</code> and pass in a time for the alarm to run at. You can use <code>state.storage.getAlarm()</code> to retrieve the currently set alarm time.</p><p>In this example, we implemented an alarm handler that wakes the Durable Object up once every 10 seconds to batch requests to a single Durable Object, deferring processing until there is enough work in the queue for it to be worthwhile to process them.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">export default {\n  async fetch(request, env) {\n    let id = env.BATCHER.idFromName(&quot;foo&quot;);\n    return await env.BATCHER.get(id).fetch(request);\n  },\n};\n\nconst SECONDS = 1000;\n\nexport class Batcher {\n  constructor(state, env) {\n    this.state = state;\n    this.storage = state.storage;\n    this.state.blockConcurrencyWhile(async () =&gt; {\n      let vals = await this.storage.list({ reverse: true, limit: 1 });\n      this.count = vals.size == 0 ? 0 : parseInt(vals.keys().next().value);\n    });\n  }\n  async fetch(request) {\n    this.count++;\n\n    // If there is no alarm currently set, set one for 10 seconds from now\n    // Any further POSTs in the next 10 seconds will be part of this kh.\n    let currentAlarm = await this.storage.getAlarm();\n    if (currentAlarm == null) {\n      this.storage.setAlarm(Date.now() + 10 * SECONDS);\n    }\n\n    // Add the request to the batch.\n    await this.storage.put(this.count, await request.text());\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ queued: this.count }), {\n      headers: {\n        &quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;application/json;charset=UTF-8&quot;,\n      },\n    });\n  }\n  async alarm() {\n    let vals = await this.storage.list();\n    await fetch(&quot;http://example.com/some-upstream-service&quot;, {\n      method: &quot;POST&quot;,\n      body: Array.from(vals.values()),\n    });\n    await this.storage.deleteAll();\n    this.count = 0;\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>Once every 10 seconds, the <code>alarm()</code> handler will be called. In the event an unexpected error terminates the Durable Object, it will be re-instantiated on another machine, following a short delay, after which it can continue processing.</p><p>Under the hood, Alarms are implemented by making reads and writes to the storage layer. This means Alarm <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> operations follow the same rules as any other storage operation – writes are coalesced with other writes, and reads have a defined ordering.

Single failures should resolve in under 30 seconds, while multiple failures may take slightly longer.</p><p>We achieve this by storing alarms in the same distributed datastore that backs the Durable Object storage API. This allows alarm reads and writes to behave identically to storage reads and writes and to be performed atomically with them, and ensures that alarms are replicated across multiple datacenters.</p><p>Within each data center capable of running Durable Objects, there are multiple processes responsible for tracking upcoming alarms and triggering them, providing fault tolerance and scalability within the data center. A single elected leader in each data center is responsible for detecting failure of other data centers and assigning responsibility of those alarms to healthy local processes in its own data center. In the event of leader failure, another leader will be elected and become responsible for executing Alarms in the data center. This allows us to guarantee at-least-once execution for all Alarms.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-do-i-get-started\">How do I get started?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-do-i-get-started\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Alarms are a great way to build new distributed primitives, like queues, atop Durable Objects.
