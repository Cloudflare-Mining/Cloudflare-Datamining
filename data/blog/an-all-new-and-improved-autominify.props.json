Originally, we did it the same way everyone else does: we&#39;d request the resource from the origin, serve it unminified on the first load, cache it, and then, if it was CSS or Javascript, run a process that minified it and replaced the cached version on the server. Seems sensible enough, but it&#39;s a bad approach.</p><p>To begin, this minification strategy doesn&#39;t work well for highly dynamic content, forcing website owners to have to go back and expire the cache whenever anything changed. For CSS and Javascript that can work, but it&#39;s a disaster for dynamic HTML. The second issue is less obvious: most minification resources don&#39;t work at our scale. We tried every minification library available, and a few non-public ones that were developed in-house by friends at some of the Internet giants, and none of them worked as efficiently as we wanted when we&#39;re minify many millions of files across twelve (and soon many more) data centers.</p><p>We were bummed because minification does provide some measurable benefit. Generally, for text based resources, our tests showed minification got about a 10% benefit when combined with our aggressive GZIP compression over just GZIP compression alone. All else being equal, if you can make a resource 10% as big it&#39;s as good as making the Internet connection 10% faster. It&#39;s not a huge win, since most bytes that make up the typical website aren&#39;t in text-based resources that can be minified. However, we believe every millisecond matters, so we looked for another way.</p><p>Unsatisfied with any of the existing minification resources, we decided to develop our own. Last week we quietly turned on a new minification process that was written to overcome the two challenges previous minification strategies had faced. First, it works in-line in the response stream, much like GZIP, which means it doesn&#39;t force you to cache content in order to get the benefit. Second, it&#39;s extremely fast. Written from the ground up to perform at line speed and is easily 100x as fast as the next closest competitor.</p><p>AutoMinify included free with any plan, and you can choose whether you want to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/how-to-minify-css/\">minify CSS</a>, Javascipt, HTML (even dynamic HTML), or any combination of the three. You can turn Auto Minify on or off via your CloudFlare Settings control panel with a single click and the settings take effect nearly instantly (because you don&#39;t have to wait for the flawed cache-and-store approach). Next up for the engineering wizards behind this: a radically better approach to image optimization.</p>",
