Here’s a case study of one such engineering effort where something counterintuitive turned out to be the right approach.</p><p>Our storage layer, which serves millions of cache hits per second globally, is powered by high <a href=\"/cloudflares-gen-x-servers-for-an-accelerated-future/\">IOPS NVMe SSDs</a>.</p><p>Although SSDs are fast and reliable, cache hit tail latency within our system is dominated by the IO capacity of our SSDs. Moreover, because flash memory chips wear out, a non-negligible portion of our operational cost, including the cost of new devices, shipment, labor and downtime, is spent on replacing dead SSDs.</p><p>Recently, we developed a technology that reduces our hit tail latency and reduces the wear out of SSDs. This technology is a memory-SSD hybrid storage system that puts <b><i>unpopular</i></b> assets in memory.</p><p><b>The end result: cache hits from our infrastructure are now faster for all customers.</b></p><p>You may have thought that was a typo in my explanation of how the technique works. In fact, a few colleagues thought the same when we proposed this project internally, “I think you meant to say <b><i>‘popular</i></b> assets’ in your document”. Intuitively, we should only put popular assets in memory since memory is even faster than SSDs.</p><p>You are not wrong. But I’m also correct.

Writes are not synchronized to disk right away. They are buffered until the page cache decides to do so at a later time, either periodically or due to memory pressure. Therefore, it also reduces repetitive writes to the same file.</p><p>However, because of the nature of the caching workload, a web asset arriving at our cache system is usually static. Unlike workloads of databases, where a single value can get repeatedly updated, in our caching workload, there are very few repetitive updates to an asset before it is completely cached.

As mentioned above, it is costly to replace SSDs. Since Cloudflare operates data centers in 200 cities across the world, the cost of shipment and replacement can be a significant proportion of the cost of the SSD itself.</p><p>Moreover, write operations on SSDs <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast12/reducing-ssd-read-latency-nand-flash-program-and-erase-suspension\">slow down read operations</a>. This is because SSD writes require program/erase (P/E) operations issued to the storage chips. These operations block reads to the same chips. In short, the more writes, the slower the reads. Since the page cache already cached popular assets, this effect has the highest impact on our cache hit tail latency. Previously we talked about how we <a href=\"/how-we-scaled-nginx-and-saved-the-world-54-years-every-day/\">dramatically reduced the impact of such latency</a>. In the meantime, directly reducing the latency itself will also be very helpful.</p><p><b>Motivation: Many assets are “one-hit-wonders”</b></p><p>One-hit-wonders refer to cached assets that are never accessed; they get accessed once and then cached yet never read again. In addition, one-hit-wonders also include cached assets that are evicted before they are used once due to their lack of popularity. The performance of websites is not harmed even if we don’t cache such assets in the first place.</p><p>To quantify how many of our assets are one-hit-wonders and to test the hypothesis that <b>reducing disk writes can speed up disk reads</b>, we conducted a simple experiment. The experiment: using a representative sample of traffic, we modified our caching logic to only cache an asset the second time our server encountered it.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7K3qlrpIfh40SNSFCLdeMl/34361c0b74a052d2010d7517cf5c25e5/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-12.35.30-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"587\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/60bqrrRAmrxDzLIvDaOUqv/92277ae85b7026fec8b786193f8518e2/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-12.44.56-PM-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"574\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The red line indicates when the experiment started. The green line represents the experimental group and the yellow line represents the control group.</p><p>The result: disk writes per second were reduced by roughly half and corresponding disk <b>hit tail latency was reduced by approximately five percent</b>.</p><p>This experiment demonstrated that if we don’t cache one-hit-wonders, our disks last longer and our cache hits are faster.</p><p>One more benefit of not caching one-hit-wonders, which was not immediately obvious from the experiment, is that, it increases the effective capacity of cache because of the reduced competing pressure from the removal of the unpopular assets. This in turn increases the cache hit ratio and cache retention.</p><p>The next question: how can we replicate these results, at scale, in production, without impacting customer experience negatively?</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"potential-implementation-approaches\">Potential implementation approaches</h2>\n      <a href=\"#potential-implementation-approaches\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"remember-but-dont-cache\">Remember but don’t cache</h3>\n      <a href=\"#remember-but-dont-cache\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>One smart way to eliminate one-hit-wonders from cache is to not cache an asset during its first few misses but to remember its appearances. When the cache system encounters the same asset repeatedly over a certain number of times, the system will start to cache the asset. This is basically what we did in the experiment above.</p><p>In order to remember the appearances, beside hash tables, many memory efficient data structures, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter\">Bloom filter</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_Bloom_filter\">Counting Bloom filter</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count%E2%80%93min_sketch\">Count-min sketch</a>, can be used with <a href=\"/when-bloom-filters-dont-bloom/\">their specific trade-offs</a>.</p><p>Such an approach solves one problem but introduces a new one: every asset is missed at least twice before it is cached. Because the number of cache misses is amplified compared to what we do today, this approach multiplies both the cost of bandwidth and server utilization for our customers.

It achieves improved performance for our customers by consuming other resources in our system. These resource consumption trade-offs must be carefully considered when deploying to systems at the scale at which Cloudflare operates.</p><p><b>Transient cache memory footprint</b></p><p>The amount of memory allocated for our transient cache matters. Cache size directly dictates how long a given asset will live in cache before it is evicted. If the transient cache is too small, new assets will evict old assets before the old assets receive hits that promote them to disk. From a customer&#39;s perspective, cache retention being too short is unacceptable because it leads to more misses, commensurate higher cost, and worse eyeball performance.</p><p><b>Competition with page cache</b></p><p>As mentioned before, the page cache uses the system’s available memory. The more memory we allocate to the transient cache for <i>unpopular</i> assets, the less memory we have for <i>popular</i> assets in the page cache. Finding the sweet spot for the trade-off between these two depends on traffic volume, usage patterns, and the specific hardware configuration our software is running on.</p><p><b>Competition with process memory usage</b></p><p>Another competitor to transient cache is regular memory used by our services and processes. Unlike the page cache, which is used opportunistically, process memory usage is a hard requirement for the operation of our software. An additional wrinkle is that some of our edge services increase their total RSS memory consumption when performing a “zero downtime upgrade”, which runs both the old and new version of the service in parallel for a short period of time. From our experience, if there is not enough physical memory to do so, the system’s overall performance will degrade to an unacceptable level due to increased IO pressure from reduced page cache space.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"in-production\">In production</h3>\n      <a href=\"#in-production\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Given the considerations above, we enabled this technology conservatively to start.

One such strategy is to refuse to promote an asset if the TTL of it has only a few seconds left, which will further reduce unnecessary disk writes.</p><p>Another aspect of the algorithms is demotion.
