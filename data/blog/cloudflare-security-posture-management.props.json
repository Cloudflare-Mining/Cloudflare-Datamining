Maintaining a healthy security posture entails monitoring and strengthening your security defenses to identify risks, ensure compliance, and protect against evolving threats. With our newest capabilities, you can now use Cloudflare to achieve a healthy posture across your SaaS and web applications.

Moreover, team members are constantly creating, updating, and deleting content that can cause configuration drift and data exposure, such as sharing files publicly, adding PII to non-compliant databases, or giving access to third party integrations.

In order to ensure that all the documents living in your SaaS apps (files, designs, etc.) are secure, we need to collect information about their configuration — are they publicly shared, do third-party apps have access, is <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/\"><u>multi-factor authentication (MFA)</u></a> enabled? </p><p>We previously did this with crawlers, which would pull data from the SaaS APIs. However, we were plagued with rate limits from the SaaS vendors when working with larger datasets. This forced us to work in batches and ramp scanning up and down as the vendors permitted. This led to stale findings and would make remediation cumbersome and unclear – for example, Cloudflare would be reporting that a file is still shared publicly for a short period after the permissions were removed, leading to customer confusion.</p><p>To fix this, we upgraded our data collection pipeline to be dynamic and real-time, reacting to changes in your environment as they occur, whether it’s a new security finding, an updated asset, or a critical alert from a vendor. We started with our Microsoft asset discovery and <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/casb-integrations/microsoft-365/\"><u>posture findings</u></a>, providing you real-time insight into your Microsoft Admin Center, OneDrive, Outlook, and SharePoint configurations.

This new capability of API Shield helps reduce risk by identifying security issues and fixing them early, before APIs are attacked. Because APIs are typically made up of many different backend services, security teams need to pinpoint which backend service is vulnerable so that development teams may remediate the identified issues.</p><p>Our new API posture management risk scans do exactly that: users can quickly identify which API endpoints are at risk to a number of vulnerabilities, including sensitive data exposure, authentication status, <a href=\"https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/\"><u>Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)</u></a> attacks, and more.</p><p>Authentication Posture is one risk scan you’ll see in the new system. We focused on it to start with because sensitive data is at risk when API authentication is assumed to be enforced but is actually broken. <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/authentication-posture/\"><u>Authentication Posture</u></a> helps customers identify authentication misconfigurations for APIs and alerts of their presence. This is achieved by scanning for successful requests against the API and noting their authentication status. API Shield scans traffic daily and labels API endpoints that have missing and mixed authentication for further review.</p><p>For customers that have configured session IDs in API Shield, you can find the new risk scan labels and authentication details per endpoint in API Shield. Security teams can take this detail to their development teams to fix the broken authentication.</p>\n          <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n          <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/21jVSrwsgfjKlyxyOZ5Qye/7963d95ea28a41f5e2b4f331ab5d5060/7.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of API Shield highlighting new authentication detail widgets on the per-endpoint details page.
