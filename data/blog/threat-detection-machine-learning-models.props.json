One way we do this is by intelligently classifying what Internet destinations are risky using the domain name system (DNS). <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/\">DNS</a> is essential to Internet navigation because it enables users to look up addresses using human-friendly names, like cloudflare.com. For websites, this means translating a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/\">domain name</a> into the IP address of the server that can deliver the content for that site.</p><p>However, attackers can exploit the DNS system itself, and often use techniques to evade detection and control using domain names that look like random strings. In this blog, we will discuss two techniques threat actors use – DNS tunneling and domain generation algorithms – and explain how Cloudflare uses <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-machine-learning/\">machine learning</a> to detect them.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"domain-generation-algorithm-dga\">Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)</h2>\n            <a href=\"#domain-generation-algorithm-dga\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Most websites don’t change their domain name very often. This is the point after all, having a stable human-friendly name to be able to connect to a resource on the Internet. However, as a side-effect stable domain names become a point of control, allowing network administrators to use restrictions on domain names to enforce policies, for example blocking access to malicious websites. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/\">Cloudflare Gateway</a> – our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/\">secure web gateway</a> service for threat defense – makes this easy to do by allowing administrators to block risky and suspicious domains based on integrated threat intelligence.</p><p>But what if instead of using a stable domain name, an attacker targeting your users generated random domain names to communicate with, making it more difficult to know in advance what domains to block? This is the idea of Domain Generation Algorithm domains (MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/002/\">T1568.002</a>).</p><p>After initial installation, malware reaches out to a command-and-control server to receive further instructions, this is called “command and control” (MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactic <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/\">TA0011</a>). The attacker may send instructions to perform such actions as gathering and transmitting information about the infected device, downloading additional stages of malware, stealing credentials and private data and sending it to the server, or operating as a bot within a network to perform denial-of-service attacks. Using a domain generation algorithm to frequently generate random domain names to communicate with for command and control gives malware a way to bypass blocks on fixed domains or IP addresses. Each day the malware generates a random set of domain names. To rendezvous with the malware, the attacker registers one of these domain names and awaits communication from the infected device.</p><p>Speed in identifying these domains is important to disrupting an attack. Because the domains rotate each day, by the time the malicious disposition of a domain propagates through the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-cyber-security/\">cybersecurity</a> community, the malware may have rotated to a new domain name. However, the random nature of these domain names (they are literally a random string of letters!) also gives us an opportunity to detect them using machine learning.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"the-machine-learning-model\">The machine learning model</h3>\n            <a href=\"#the-machine-learning-model\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>To identify DGA domains,  we trained a model that extends a pre-trained transformers-based neural network. <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/03/25/what-is-a-transformer-model/\">Transformers-based neural networks</a> are the state-of-the-art technique in natural language processing, and underlie <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-large-language-model/\">large language models</a> and services like ChatGPT. They are trained by using adjacent words and context around a word or character to “learn” what is likely to come next.</p><p>Domain names largely contain words and abbreviations that are meaningful in human language. Looking at the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains\">top domains on Cloudflare Radar</a>, we see that they are largely composed of words and common abbreviations, “face” and “book” for example, or “cloud” and “flare”. This makes the knowledge of human language encoded in transformer models a powerful tool for detecting random domain names.</p><p>For DGA models, we curated ground truth data that consisted of domain names observed from Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver for the negative class, and we used domain names from known domain generation algorithms for the positive class (all uses of DNS resolver data is completed in accordance with our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/\">privacy commitments</a>).</p><p>Our final training set contained over 250,000 domain names, and was weighted to include more negative (not DGA domains) than positive cases. We trained three different versions of the model with different architectures: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network), LightGBM (binary classification), and a transformer-based model. We selected the transformer based model based on it having the highest accuracy and F1 score (the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-f1-score-bec2bbc38aa6\">F1 score</a> is a measure of model fit that penalizes having very different precision and recall, on an imbalanced data set the highest accuracy model might be the one that predicts everything either true or false, not what we want!), with an accuracy of over 99% on the test data.</p><p>To compute the score for a new domain never seen before by the model, the domain name is tokenized (i.e. broken up into individual components, in this case characters), and the sequence of characters are passed to the model. The <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.0.2/index.html\">transformers</a> Python package from Hugging Face makes it easy to use these types of models for a variety of applications. The library supports summarization, question answering, translation, text generation, classification, and more. In this case we use <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.0.2/index.html\">sequence classification</a>, together with a model that was customized for this task. The output of the model is a score indicating the chance that the domain was generated by a domain generation algorithm. If the score is over our threshold, we label the domain and a domain generation algorithm domain.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"deployment\">Deployment</h3>\n            <a href=\"#deployment\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The expansive view of domain names Cloudflare has from our 1.1.1.1 resolver means we can quickly observe DGA domains after they become active.

One way to send data and bypass traditional detection methods is to encode data within another protocol. When the attacker controls the authoritative name server for a domain, information can be encoded as DNS queries and responses. Instead of making a DNS query for a simple domain name, such as <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com\">www.cloudflare.com</a>, and getting a response like 104.16.124.96, attackers can send and receive long DNS queries and responses that contain encoded data.</p><p>Here is an example query made by an application performing DNS tunneling (query shortened and partially redacted):</p><p><code>3rroeuvx6bkvfwq7dvruh7adpxzmm3zfyi244myk4gmswch4lcwmkvtqq2cryyi.qrsptavsqmschy2zeghydiff4ogvcacaabc3mpya2baacabqtqcaa2iaaaaocjb.br1ns.example.com</code></p><p>The response data to a query like the one above can vary in length based on the response record type the server uses and the recursive DNS resolvers in the path.

Queries like this are often used by security and monitoring applications and network appliances to check in. The leading portion of the query might be the unique id of the device or installation that is performing the check-in.</p><p>During the research and training phase our researchers identified a wide variety of different applications that use a large number of random looking DNS queries.

A decision tree model is like playing 20 questions – each layer of the decision tree asks a yes or no question, which gets you closer to the final answer.

We see the 28 input features at the top layer and at the bottom layer, the 17 output values indicating the prediction value for each type of application. This neural network is very small, having about 2,000 individual weights that can be set during the training process. In the next section we will see an example of a model that is based on a state-of-the-art pretrained model from a model family that has tens to hundreds of millions of predefined weights.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6qkJkL0s3NDzVk4cgEl0hq/2b34d1060f540b0d8eda15ab694a14ad/Screenshot-2023-03-15-at-11.24.14.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1596\" height=\"814\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Fig. 2, The keras.utils.plot_model() function draws a diagram of the neural network layers.</p><p>Figure 3 shows a plot of the feature values of the applications we are trying to distinguish in polar coordinates. Each color is the feature values of all the domains the model classified as a single type of application over a sample period. The position around the circle (theta) is the feature, and the distance from the center (rho) is the value of that feature. We can see how many of the applications have similar feature values.</p><p>When we observe a new domain and compute its feature values, our model uses those feature values to give us a prediction about which application the new domain resembles. As mentioned, the neural network has 28 inputs each of which is the value for a single feature and 17 outputs. The 17 output values represent the prediction that the domain is each of those 17 different types of applications, with malicious DNS tunneling being one of the 17 outputs. The job of the model is to convert the sometimes small differences between the feature values into a prediction. If the value of the malicious DNS tunneling output of the neural network is higher than the other outputs, the domain is labeled as a security threat.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1FaIlCe95na1Jfpx8WzfT7/93729854869830e3e4fbc460f50029f3/Screenshot-2023-03-15-at-11.24.49.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1614\" height=\"1066\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Fig. 3, Domains containing high-entropy DNS subdomains, visualized as feature plots. Each section around the circumference of the plot represents a different feature of the observed DNS queries. The distance from the center represents the value of that feature. Each color line is a distinct application, and machine learning helps us distinguish between these and classify them.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"deployment\">Deployment</h3>\n            <a href=\"#deployment\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>For the DNS tunneling model, our system consumes the logs from our secure web gateway service.
