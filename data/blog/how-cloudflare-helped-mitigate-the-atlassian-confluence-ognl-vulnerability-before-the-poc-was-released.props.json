The advisory highlighted an Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) injection that would result in an unauthenticated attacker being able to execute arbitrary code.</p><p>A full proof of concept (PoC) of the attack <a href=\"https://github.com/httpvoid/writeups/blob/main/Confluence-RCE.md\">was made available by a security researcher</a> on August 31, 2021. Cloudflare immediately reviewed the PoC and prepared a mitigation rule via an <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/change-log/2021-09-01---emergency-release\">emergency release</a>. The rule, once tested, was deployed on September 1, 2021, at 15:32 UTC with a default action of <code>BLOCK</code> and the following IDs:</p><ul><li><p><code>100400</code> (for our legacy WAF)</p></li><li><p><code>e8c550810618437c953cf3a969e0b97a</code> (for our <a href=\"/new-cloudflare-waf/\">new WAF</a>)</p></li></ul><p>All customers using the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/\">Cloudflare WAF</a> to protect their self-hosted Confluence applications have automatically been protected since the new rule was deployed last week. Additionally, the Cloudflare WAF started blocking a high number of potentially malicious requests to Confluence applications even before the rule was deployed.</p><p>And customers who had deployed <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/access/\">Cloudflare Access</a> in front of their Confluence applications were already protected even before the emergency release. Access checks every request made to a protected hostname for a JSON Web Token (<a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/users/validating-json\">JWT</a>) containing a user’s identity. Any unauthenticated users attempting this exploit would have been blocked before they could reach the Confluence server.</p><p>Customers must, however, immediately update their self-hosted Confluence installations to the versions listed in <a href=\"https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2021-08-25-1077906215.html\">the advisory</a> to ensure full protection.</p><p>This vulnerability was assigned the <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26084\">CVE number 2021-26084</a> and has a base score of 9.8 — critical.

Cloudflare maintains aggregated and sampled data on WAF blocks<sup>1</sup> that can be used to explore how quickly vulnerable endpoints start receiving malicious traffic, highlighting the importance of deploying patches as quickly as possible.</p><p>Cloudflare data suggests that scanning for the vulnerability started up to three days before the first publicly available PoC was published, as high WAF activity was observed on vulnerable endpoints beginning August 28, 2021. This activity may indicate that attackers or researchers had successfully reverse engineered the patch within that time frame.</p><p>It also shows that, even without the specific WAF rule that we rolled out for this vulnerability, Cloudflare was blocking attempts to exploit it. Other WAF rules picked up the suspect behavior.</p><p>For this vulnerability, two endpoints are highlighted that can be used to explore attack traffic:</p><ul><li><p><code>/pages/doenterpagevariables.action</code></p></li><li><p><code>/pages/createpage-entervariables.action</code></p></li></ul><p>The following graph shows traffic matching Cloudflare’s WAF security feature from August 21 to September 5, 2021. Specifically:</p><ul><li><p>In blue: HTTP requests blocked by Cloudflare’s WAF matching the two chosen paths.</p></li><li><p>In red: HTTP requests blocked by Cloudflare’s WAF matching the two paths and the specific rule deployed to cover this vulnerability.</p></li></ul>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6RB87PobsiApq5SVeqirt6/6be93975159cb4b52dadba4a859a6775/image1-3.png\" alt=\"Line chart showing traffic trends to the vulnerable endpoints from the August 21 to September 5\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1428\" height=\"882\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>By looking at the data, an increase in activity can be seen starting from August 28, 2021 — far beyond normal Internet background noise levels.
