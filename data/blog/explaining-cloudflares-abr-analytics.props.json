The lower resolution version will provide the same answer but take less time and fewer resources.  By using multiple, different resolutions of the same data, our analytics can provide consistent response times and a better user experience.</p><p>You might be aware that we <a href=\"/http-analytics-for-6m-requests-per-second-using-clickhouse/\">use a columnar store called ClickHouse</a> to store and process our analytics data.  When using ABR with ClickHouse, we write the same data at multiple resolutions into separate tables.  Usually, we cover seven orders of magnitude – from 100% to 0.0001% of the original events.  We wind up using an additional 12% of disk storage but enable very fast ad hoc queries on the reduced resolution tables.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2HKrBQ950HetBHxqHDgHUl/95051dc10f00da3e1c8cafee0d26084a/abr_storage--1-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"720\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"aggregations-and-rollups\">Aggregations and Rollups</h3>\n            <a href=\"#aggregations-and-rollups\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>The ABR technique facilitates aggregations by making compact estimates of every dimension.  Another way to achieve the same ends is with a system that computes “rollups”.  Rollups save space by computing either complete or partial aggregations of the data as it arrives.  </p><p>For example, suppose we wanted to count a total number of lentils. (Lentils are legumes and among the oldest and most widely cultivated crops.  They are a staple food in many parts of the world.)  We could just count each lentil as it passed through the processing system. Of course because there a lot of lentils, that system is distributed – meaning that there are hundreds of separate machines.  Therefore we’ll actually have hundreds of separate counters.</p><p>Also, we’ll want to include more information than just the count, so we’ll also include the weight of each lentil and maybe 10 or 20 other attributes. And of course, we don’t want just a total for each attribute, but we’ll want to be able to break it down by color, origin, distributor and many other things, and also we’ll want to break these down by slices of time.</p><p>In the end, we’ll have tens of thousands or possibly millions of aggregations to be tabulated and saved every minute.  These aggregations are expensive to compute, especially when using aggregations more complicated than simple counters and sums.  They also destroy some information.  For example, once we’ve processed all the lentils through the rollups, we can’t say for sure that we’ve counted them all, and most importantly, whichever attributes we neglected to aggregate are unavailable.</p><p>The number we’re counting, 6.3M tonnes, only includes two significant digits which can easily be achieved by counting a sample.  Most of the rollup computations used on each lentil (on the order 1013 to account for 6.3M tonnes) are wasted.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"other-forms-of-aggregations\">Other forms of aggregations</h3>\n            <a href=\"#other-forms-of-aggregations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>So far, we’ve discussed ABR and its application to aggregations, but we’ve only given examples involving “counts” and “sums”.  There are other, more complex forms of aggregations we use quite heavily.  Two examples are “topK” and “count-distinct”.</p><p>A “topK” aggregation attempts to show the K most frequent items in a set.  For example, the most frequent IP address, or country.  To compute topK, just count the frequency of each item in the set and return the K items with the highest frequencies. Under ABR, we compute topK based on the set found in the matching resolution sample. Using a sample makes this computation a lot faster and less complex, but there are problems.</p><p>The estimate of topK derived from a sample is biased and dependent on the distribution of the underlying data. This can result in overestimating the significance of elements in the set as compared to their frequency in the full set. In practice this effect can only be noticed when the cardinality of the set is very high and you’re not going to notice this effect on a Cloudflare dashboard.  If your site has a lot of traffic and you’re looking at the Top K URLs or browser types, there will be no difference visible at different resolutions.  Also keep in mind that as long as we’re estimating the “proportion” of the element in the set and the set is large, the results will be quite accurate.</p><p>The other fascinating aggregation we support is known as “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count-distinct_problem\">count-distinct</a>”, or number of uniques.  In this case we want to know the number of unique values in a set.  For example, how many unique cache keys have been used.  We can safely say that a uniform random sample of the set cannot be used to estimate this number.  However, we do have a solution.</p><p>We can generate another, alternate sample based on the value in question.  For example, instead of taking a random sample of all requests, we take a random sample of IP addresses.  This is sometimes called distinct reservoir sampling, and it allows us to estimate the true number of distinct IPs based on the cardinality of the sampled set. Again, there are techniques available to improve these estimates, and we’ll be implementing some of those.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"abr-improves-resilience-and-scalability\">ABR improves resilience and scalability</h3>\n            <a href=\"#abr-improves-resilience-and-scalability\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Using ABR saves us resources.  Even better, it allows us to query all the attributes in the original data, not just those included in rollups.  And even better, it allows us to check our assumptions against different sample intervals in separate tables as a check that the system is working correctly, because the original events are preserved.</p><p>However, the greatest benefits of employing ABR are the ones that aren’t directly visible.
