Our systems automatically detected and mitigated this attack and many more. Since then, we have been tracking this <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-botnet/\">botnet</a>, which we’ve called “<b>Mantis</b>”, and the attacks it has launched against almost a thousand Cloudflare customers.</p><p>Cloudflare <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/\">WAF</a>/<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/\">CDN</a> customers are protected against HTTP DDoS attacks including Mantis attacks.

Mantis shrimps, also known as “thumb-splitters”, are very small; less than 10 cm in length, but their claws are so powerful that they can generate a shock wave with a force of 1,500 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)\">Newtons</a> at speeds of 83 km/h from a standing start. Similarly, the Mantis botnet operates a small fleet of approximately 5,000 bots, but with them can generate a massive force — responsible for the largest HTTP DDoS attacks we have ever observed.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1V9rattTw2PrfgiSOpcd9Q/b4259da4be5fc07b18a1781e69ca3559/image7-3.png\" alt=\"Image of the Mantis shrimp from Wikipedia\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1800\" height=\"890\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Mantis shrimp. Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OdontodactylusScyllarus2.jpg\">Wikipedia</a>.</p><p>The Mantis botnet was able to generate the 26M HTTPS requests per second attack using <b>only</b> 5,000 bots. I’ll repeat that: 26 million HTTPS requests per second using <b>only</b> 5,000 bots. That’s an average of 5,200 HTTPS rps per bot. Generating 26M HTTP requests is hard enough to do without the extra overhead of establishing a secure connection, but Mantis did it over <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/\">HTTPS</a>. HTTPS DDoS attacks are more expensive in terms of required computational resources because of the higher cost of establishing a secure <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/\">TLS</a> encrypted connection. This stands out and highlights the unique strength behind this botnet.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/70DLbkvVYf1WA6sJWGbkAr/ea064383fa6bce8060b98a7e2cb157a7/image1-5.png\" alt=\"Graph of the 26 million requests per second DDoS attack\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1438\" height=\"660\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>As opposed to “traditional” botnets that are formed of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-of-things-iot/\">Internet of Things (IoT) devices</a> such as DVRs, CC cameras, or smoke detectors, Mantis uses hijacked virtual machines and powerful servers. This means that each bot has a lot more computational resources — resulting in this combined thumb-splitting strength.</p><p>Mantis is the next evolution of the Meris botnet. The Meris botnet relied on MikroTik devices, but Mantis has branched out to include a variety of VM platforms and supports running various HTTP proxies to launch attacks. The name Mantis was chosen to be similar to &quot;Meris&quot; to reflect its origin, and also because this evolution hits hard and fast. Over the past few weeks, Mantis has been especially active directing its strengths towards almost 1,000 Cloudflare customers.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3cfFRnyCyBOEE0mR9PMPlE/617bdc30c47b4890dfab5ba5422bc60b/image4-6.png\" alt=\"Graphic design of a botnet\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1012\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"who-is-mantis-attacking\">Who is Mantis attacking?</h3>\n            <a href=\"#who-is-mantis-attacking\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In our recent <a href=\"/ddos-attack-trends-for-2022-q2/\">DDoS attack trends report</a>, we talked about the increasing number of HTTP DDoS attacks.
