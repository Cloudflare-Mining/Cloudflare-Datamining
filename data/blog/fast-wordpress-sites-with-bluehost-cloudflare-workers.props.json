In collaboration with Bluehost, Cloudflare’s Workers have been able to achieve a 40% performance improvement for those sites running Workers. Bluehost started with Cloudflare Workers <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-examples/tree/master/examples/fast-google-fonts\">code</a> for <a href=\"/fast-google-fonts-with-cloudflare-workers/\">Fast Google Fonts</a> which in-lines the browser-specific font CSS and re-hosts the font files through the page origin. This removes the multiple calls to load the CSS and the font file from Google and improves WordPress site response time.  Bluehost then went further and added additional <a href=\"https://github.com/pmeenan/cf-workers/tree/master/streaming-optimizations\">performance enhancements</a> that rehosted commonly run third party scripts and caches dynamic HTML on the edge in conjunction with Bluehost’s own plugin infrastructure.</p><p>Bluehost will offer Cloudflare Workers in early 2020. Once implemented, customers will see faster response times, which could result in more website visitors sticking with the site while it renders. Additional benefits could include improved ad dollars from a higher number of impressions and ecommerce revenue from more shoppers.</p><p>“We were so impressed to see a 40% performance improvement for websites leveraging Workers, and can’t wait to offer this to our customers in 2020. Our team is excited to partner with Cloudflare and continue to innovate with Workers for added benefits for our customers,” said Suhaib Zaheer, General Manager for Bluehost.</p><p>Stay tuned for more performance improvements with Cloudflare Workers!</p>",
