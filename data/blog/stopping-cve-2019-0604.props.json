This would imply only an insider threat, someone who has authorisation within SharePoint, such as an employee, on the local network could exploit the vulnerability.</p><p>We discovered that was not always the case, since there were paths which could be reached without authentication, via external facing websites. Using the NIST NVD calculator, it determines the actual base score to be a 9.8 severity out of 10 without the authentication requirement.</p><p>As part of our internal vulnerability scoring process, we decided this was critical enough to require immediate attention. This was for a number of reasons. The first being it was a critical CVE affecting a major software ecosystem, primarily aimed at enterprise businesses. There appeared to be no stable patch available at the time. And, there were several reports of it being actively exploited in the wild by APTs.</p><p>We deployed an initial firewall rule the same day, rule 100157. This allowed us to analyse traffic and request frequency before making a decision on the default action. At the same time, it gave our customers the ability to protect their online assets from these attacks in advance of a patch.</p><p>We observed the first probes at around 4:47 PM on the 11th of May, which went on until 9:12 PM. We have reason to believe these were not successful attacks, and were simply reconnaissance probes at this point.</p><p>The online vulnerable hosts exposed to the web were largely made up of high traffic enterprise businesses, which makes sense based on the below graph from W3Techs.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4wJkuPfdv3d8E0KBvbS00c/1834c92fcdc1367767eacb7a0687e60a/pasted-image-0.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Figure 1: Depicts SharePoint’s market position (Image attributed to W3Techs)</p><p>The publicly accessible proof of concept exploit code found online did not work out of the box. Therefore it was not immediately widely used, since it required weaponisation by a more skilled adversary.</p><p>We give customers advance notice of most rule changes. However, in this case, we decided that the risk was high enough that we needed to act upon this, and so made the decision to make an immediate rule release to block this malicious traffic for all of our customers on May 13th.</p><p>We were confident enough in going default block here, as the requests we’d analysed so far did not appear to be legitimate. We took several factors into consideration to determine this, some of which are detailed below.</p><p>The bulk of requests we’d seen so far, a couple hundred, originated from cloud instances, within the same IP ranges. They were enumerating the subdomains of many websites over a short time period.</p><p>This is a fairly common scenario. Malicious actors will perform reconnaissance using various methods in an attempt to find a vulnerable host to attack, before actually exploiting the vulnerability. The query string parameters also appeared suspicious, having only the ones necessary to exploit the vulnerability and nothing more.</p><p>The rule was deployed in default block mode protecting our customers, before security researchers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1oopho1e/status/1127916284899995648\">discovered</a> how to weaponise the exploit and before a stable patch from Microsoft was widely adopted.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"the-vulnerability\">The vulnerability</h3>\n      <a href=\"#the-vulnerability\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Zero Day Initiative did a good job in drilling down on the <a href=\"https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2019/3/13/cve-2019-0604-details-of-a-microsoft-sharepoint-rce-vulnerability\">root cause</a> of this vulnerability, and how it could potentially be exploited in practice.</p><p>From debugging the .NET executable, they discovered the following functions could eventually reach the deserialisation call, and so may potentially be exploitable.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/56GCIIrCIBXjX17RdIWfuK/355601f3eb78ee7a87cff26760b16f81/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"327\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Figure 2: Depicts the affected function calls (Image attributed to Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative)</p><p>The most interesting ones here are the “<code>.Page_Load</code>” and “<code>.OnLoad</code>” methods, as these can be directly accessed by visiting a webpage.

On Monday the 13th we observed our first exploit attempts, and on the 14th saw what we believe to be individuals manually attempting to exploit sites for this vulnerability.</p><p>Given this was a weekend, it realistically gives you 1 working day to have rolled out a patch across your organisation, before malicious actors started attempting to exploit this vulnerability.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3QlsLteHH44MkRYSLMRRku/e4c2ac64fbf1396c0b037a076add43c3/5-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1596\" height=\"581\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Figure 5: Depicts requests matched, rule 100157 was set as default block early 13th May.</p><p>Further into the week, we started seeing smaller spikes for the rule. And on the 16th May, the same day the UK’s NCSC put out an <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/alert-microsoft-sharepoint-remote-code-vulnerability\">alert</a> reporting of highly successful exploitation attempts against UK organisations, thousands of requests were dropped, primarily launched at larger enterprises and government entities.</p><p>This is often the nature of such targeted attacks, malicious actors will try to automate exploits to have the biggest possible impact, and that’s exactly what we saw here.</p><p>So far into our analysis, we’ve seen malicious hits for the following paths:</p><ul><li><p>/_layouts/15/Picker.aspx</p></li><li><p>/_layouts/Picker.aspx</p></li><li><p>/_layouts/15/downloadexternaldata.aspx</p></li></ul><p>The bulk of attacks we’ve seen have been targeting the unauthenticated Picker.aspx endpoint as one would expect, using the ItemPickerDialog type:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">/_layouts/15/picker.aspx?PickerDialogType=Microsoft.SharePoint.Portal.WebControls.ItemPickerDialog</pre></code>\n            <p>We expect the vulnerability to be exploited more when a complete exploit is publicly available, so it is important to update your systems if you have not already. We also recommend isolating these systems to the internal network in cases they do not need to be external facing, in order to avoid an unnecessary attack surface.</p><p>Sometimes it’s not practical to isolate such systems to an internal network, this is usually the case for global organisations, with teams spanning multiple locations. In these cases, we highly recommend putting these systems behind an access management solution, like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-access/\">Cloudflare Access</a>. This gives you granular control over who can access resources, and has the additional benefit of auditing user access.</p><p>Microsoft initially released a patch, but it did not address all vulnerable functions, therefore customers were left vulnerable with the only options being to virtually patch their systems or shut their services down entirely until an effective fix became available.</p><p>This is a prime example of why firewalls like Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/\">WAF</a> are critical to keeping a business online. Sometimes patching is not an option, and even when it is, it can take time to roll out effectively across an enterprise.</p>",
