A lot of these problems come from platform restriction at an enterprise level, legacy tech stacks, incorrect builds, and years of patching together various services and infrastructures.</p><p>As a team of technical SEO consultants, we can often be left frustrated by these barriers, that often lead to essential fixes and implementations either being not possible or delayed for months (if not years) at a time – and in this time, the business is often losing traffic and revenue.</p><p>Workers offers us a hail Mary solution to a lot of common frustrations in getting technical SEO implemented, and we believe in the long run can become an integral part of overcoming legacy issues, reducing DevOps costs, speeding up lead times, all in addition to utilising a globally distributed serverless platform with blazing fast cold start times.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"creating-accessibility-at-scale\">Creating accessibility at scale</h2>\n      <a href=\"#creating-accessibility-at-scale\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>When we first started out, we needed to implement simple redirects, which should be easy to create on the majority of platforms but wasn’t supported in this instance.</p><p>When the second barrier arose, we needed to inject Hreflang tags, cross-linking an old multi-lingual website on a bespoke platform build to an outdated spec. This required experiments to find an efficient way of implementing the tags without increasing latency or adding new code to the server – in a manner befitting of search engine crawling.</p><p>At this point we had a number of other applications for Workers, with arising need for non-developers to be able to modify and deploy new Worker code. This has since become an idea of Worker code generation, via Web UI or command line.</p><p>Having established a number of different use cases for Workers, we identified 3 processing phases:</p><ul><li><p>Incoming request modification – changing origin request URL or adding authorization headers.</p></li><li><p>Outgoing response modification - adding security headers, Hreflang header injection, logging.</p></li><li><p>Response body modification – injecting/changing content e.g. canonicals, robots and JSON-LD</p></li></ul><p>We wanted to generate lean Worker code, which would enable us to keep each functionality contained and independent of another, and went with an idea of filter chains, which can be used to compose fairly complex request processing.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5XNqSuHWNflu8gXityDn7E/71deac0da1e6aa40f55fb22e387e3ffd/request-filter-chain.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"628\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>A request chain depicting the path of a request as it is transformed while moving from client to origin server and back again.</p><p>A key accessibility issue we identified from a non-technical perspective was the goal trying of making this serverless technology accessible to all in SEO, because with understanding comes buy-in from stakeholders. In order to do this, we had to make Workers:</p><ul><li><p>Accessible to users who don’t understand how to write JavaScript / Performant JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Process of implementation can complement existing deployment processes</p></li><li><p>Process of implementation is secure (internally and externally)</p></li><li><p>Process of implementation is compliant with data and privacy policies</p></li><li><p>Implementations must be able to be verified through existing processes and practices (BAU)</p></li></ul><p>Before we dive into actual filters, here are partial TypeScript interfaces to illustrate filter APIs:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">interface FilterExecutor&lt;Type, Context, ReturnType extends Type | void&gt; {\n    apply(filterChain: { next: (c: Context, obj: Type) =&gt; ReturnType | Promise&lt;ReturnType&gt; }&gt;, context: Context, obj: Type): ReturnType | Promise&lt;ReturnType&gt;;\n}\ninterface RequestFilterContext {\n    // Request URL\n    url: URL;\n    // Short-circuit request filters \n    respondWith(response: Response | Promise&lt;Response&gt;): void;\n    // Short-circuit all filters\n    respondWithAndStop(response: Response | Promise&lt;Response&gt;): void;\n    // Add additonal response filter\n    appendResponseFilter(filter: ResponseFilter): void;\n    // Add body filter\n    appendBodyFilter(filter: BodyFilter): void;\n}\ninterface RequestFilter extends FilterExecutor&lt;Request, RequestFilterContext, Request&gt; { };\ninterface ResponseFilterContext {\n    readonly startMs: number;\n    readonly endMs: number;\n    readonly url: URL;\n    waitUntil(promise: Promise&lt;any&gt;): void;\n    respondWith(response: Response | Promise&lt;Response&gt;): void;\n    respondWithAndStop(response: Response | Promise&lt;Response&gt;): void;\n    appendBodyFilter(filter: BodyFilter): void;\n}\ninterface ResponseFilter extends FilterExecutor&lt;Response, ResponseFilterContext, Response&gt; { };\ninterface BodyFilterContext {\n    waitUntil(promise: Promise&lt;any&gt;): void;\n}\ninterface ChunkChain {\n    public next: ChunkChain | null;\n    public chunk: Uint8Array;\n}\ninterface BodyFilter extends MutableFilterExecutor&lt;ChunkChain | null, BodyFilterContext, ChunkChain | null&gt; { };</pre></code>\n            <p>Request filter — Simple Redirects</p><hr/><p>Firstly, we would like to point out that this is very niche use case, if your platform supports redirects natively, you should absolutely do it through your platform, but there are a number of limited, legacy or bespoke platforms, where redirects are not supported or are limited, or are charged for (per line) by your hosting or platform. For example, Github Pages only support redirects via HTML refresh meta tag.</p><p>The most basic redirect filter, would look like this:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">class RedirectRequestFilter {\n    constructor(redirects) {\n        this.redirects = redirects;\n    }\n\n    apply(filterChain, context, request) {\n        const redirect = this.redirects[context.url.href];\n        if (redirect)\n            context.respondWith(new Response(&#039;&#039;, {\n                status: 301,\n                headers: { &#039;Location&#039;: redirect }\n            }));\n        else\n            return filterChain.next(context, request);\n    }\n}\n\nconst { requestFilterHandle } = self.slothRequire(&#039;./worker.js&#039;);\nrequestFilterHandle.append(new RedirectRequestFilter({\n    &quot;https://sloth.cloud/old-homepage&quot;: &quot;https://sloth.cloud/&quot;\n}));</pre></code>\n            <p>You can see it live in Cloudflare’s playground <a href=\"https://cloudflareworkers.com/#f59a71db84c026a5d2bee72170113f26:https://sloth.cloud/old-homepage\">here</a>.</p><p>The one implemented in Sloth supports basic path matching, hostname matching and query string matching, as well as wildcards.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7bOFFqK57Xr5IsGHGsxCyd/683f3bb5a86104abf6112949e4ddcb6d/sloth-redirect-manager.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"939\" height=\"343\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The Sloth dashboard for visually creating and modifying redirects. </p><p>It is all well and good when you do not have a lot of redirects to manage, but what do you do when size of redirects starts to take up significant memory available to Worker? This is where we faced another scaling issue, in taking a small handful of possible redirects, to the tens of thousands.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"managing-redirects-with-workers-kv-and-cuckoo-filters\">Managing Redirects with Workers KV and Cuckoo Filters</h2>\n      <a href=\"#managing-redirects-with-workers-kv-and-cuckoo-filters\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Well, here is one way you can solve it by using <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/kv/\">Workers KV</a> - a key-value data store.</p><p>Instead of hard coding redirects inside Worker code, we will store them inside Workers KV.
