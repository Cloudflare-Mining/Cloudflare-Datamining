Sum that question up across a lot of users in a lot of different countries, and you end up with a sense of the most popular websites and services in the world. In a nutshell, that’s what this blog post is about: how humans interacted with the online world in 2023 from what Cloudflare observed.</p><p>Building on similar reports we’ve done over the past two years, we have compiled a ranking of the top Internet properties of 2023. In addition to our overall ranking, we chose 9 categories to focus on. One of these is a new addition in 2023: Generative AI. Here are the 9 categories we’ll be digging into:</p><p>1. <a href=\"#generativeai\">Generative AI</a><br>2. <a href=\"#socialmedia\">Social Media</a><br>3. <a href=\"#ecommerce\">E-commerce</a><br>4. <a href=\"#videostreaming\">Video Streaming</a><br>5. <a href=\"#news\">News</a><br>6. <a href=\"#messaging\">Messaging</a><br>7. <a href=\"#metaversegaming\">Metaverse &amp; Gaming</a><br>8. <a href=\"#financialservices\">Financial Services</a><br>9. <a href=\"#cryptocurrencyservices\">Cryptocurrency Services</a></p><p>Our method for calculating the results is the same as in <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2022-year-in-review/\">2022</a>: we analyze anonymized DNS query data from our <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/\">1.1.1.1</a> public <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/\">DNS resolver</a>, used by millions of people around the world. To build the lists of Internet services, we use two additional methods. First, we aggregate domains that belong to one online service. For instance, for Twitter/X, we include twitter.com, t.co, and x.com among others. Second, we reference our large <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains\">source list of domains</a> and identify the sites that provide services to humans. That means that our rankings do not include every domain seen in the data (for example, we exclude domains such as root-servers.net and cloudflare-dns.com). A site’s overall ranking is relative to other sites that meet these criteria; its rank within a category is relative to other sites in the same category. That’s important to note: just because a site has gone down in the rankings, it doesn’t necessarily mean its traffic has declined — it could just be that other sites' traffic increased. Similarly, the inverse is true. What we’re doing here isn’t tracking absolute traffic, but rather, relative popularity.</p><p>With that, we can begin our analysis. Following the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT launch on November 30, 2022, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-generative-ai/\">Generative AI</a> has captivated both the world and the news. OpenAI is now close to ranking among our top 100 most popular Internet services overall, rising from #200 in January.</p><p>In e-commerce, low price and fast fashion marketplace Temu experienced similar growth, becoming the year's surprise by surpassing Shein and other major players, reaching #7 in its category. And Black Friday was the best day for several other e-commerce services, as well as payment services such as PayPal, Stripe and Klarna.</p><p>In social media, X/Twitter lost some ground in our Overall ranking, but maintained its status as a significant online discussion platform. New additions like Threads by Instagram, launched in July, are still gaining their footing in the category. Additionally, we observed notable news-related trends linked to events such as the March 2023 United States banking crisis, the Titan submersible implosion, the Wagner Group rebellion, and the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.</p><p>We close our report out with a discussion of a range of trends that don’t fit neatly into our other categories, including a look at Taylor Swift’s and Beyoncé websites — both of which appeared in our overall traffic rankings.</p><p>Keep reading for a detailed look at the evolution of trends throughout the year.

Facebook, Apple and TikTok follow</h2><p>Since we began reporting these rankings in <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/popular-domains-year-in-review-2021/\">2021</a>, we always start with an Overall Top 10 list. These are the services that are the top Internet properties globally in 2023, based on DNS traffic through our 1.1.1.1 resolver. Unsurprisingly, Google (we’re including here services like Google Maps and Google Flights that use google.com, for example) remained the #1 most popular Internet service in our Overall ranking. Since we implemented our new ranking method <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2022-year-in-review/\">last year</a>, no other service has challenged Google's position as the #1 leader in our rankings.</p><h3 id=\"top-10-%E2%80%94-most-popular-internet-services-2023-overall\">Top 10 — Most popular Internet services 2023, Overall</h3><ol><li>Google</li><li>Facebook</li><li>Apple</li><li>TikTok</li><li>Microsoft</li><li>YouTube</li><li>AWS</li><li>Instagram</li><li>Amazon</li><li>iCloud</li></ol><p>Beyond Google, Facebook was consistently #2, while Apple (that uses, for example, apple.com for several use cases, including on iPhone related services) was generally #3, except when TikTok took the spot in April. Microsoft mostly held the #5 ranking, although it sometimes traded places with YouTube at #6.</p><p>AWS — we’re separating it from Amazon by using domains like amazonaws.com — held a firm position at #7, and Instagram was clearly #8 through the year, with a few exceptions involving Amazon. The #10 position changed more frequently, alternating between iCloud (for which we use domains such as icloud.com, distinct from apple.com), Netflix (mainly on weekends), and Microsoft Office.

We tested it on our <a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/shows/this-week-in-net/this-week-in-net-new-pricing-annual-plans-and-an-ai-chatgpt-test/zv9wlxZQ\">'This Week in NET’</a> show on December 2, 2022, and were impressed. It's not surprising that OpenAI was popular early in 2023 and topped this list. Other generative AI services also emerged during the year.</p><h3 id=\"top-10-%E2%80%94-generative-ai-services-2023\">Top 10 — Generative AI services 2023</h3><ol><li>OpenAI</li><li>character.ai</li><li>QuillBot</li><li>Hugging Face</li><li>Poe</li><li>Perplexity</li><li>Wordtune</li><li>Bard</li><li>ProWritingAid</li><li>Voicemod</li></ol><p>Significant changes occurred below Open AI’s #1 spot throughout the year. After mid-year, we noticed a shift, when character.ai took the #2 spot from Quillbot. Quora's Poe AI, which combines several AI chatbots including ChatGPT, entered the top 10 in late March, holding the #3 spot until late April before settling at #4.</p><p>This figure shows movement among the Generative AI services that were more popular later in the year:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/12/Untitled-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"633\"></figure><p>AI model platform Hugging Face was typically #5, but Google’s Bard also reached #5 in November. Bard, launched in limited regions in March, made our top 10 within the category after its broader release in Europe and Brazil. It was #7 from July to September before peaking later in the year.</p><p>Other Generative AI services that became important in our list later in 2023 include Anthropic's Claude (whose new model, Claude 2, launched in July, though it <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude-ai-locations\">is not yet available</a> in the European Union). It was #5 in August before dropping to #6 after September. Perplexity AI, a ChatGPT competitor, was #8 after September.</p><p>Midjourney, which relies on Discord bot commands to create artwork, peaked at #3 in late March but started declining, dropping to #5 in April and May, and then to #10 in September.</p><p>Other AI-inclusive services like Prowritingaid, Voicemod, and Wordtune were more popular earlier in the year but became less so later on. Bardeen was in the top 10 in May and June, while Descript appeared at #9 between March and May.</p><p>Notable trends that we observed when looking at trends for Generative AI services in our larger Overall ranking include:</p><ul><li><strong>OpenAI</strong>, which was around #200 in our Overall ranking in early January, saw a significant rise between March and April (OpenAI launched <a href=\"https://openai.com/gpt-4\">GPT-4</a> and <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins\">plugins</a> during that time) and is now near the top 100. It peaked early in November (#104 on November 9), right after OpenAI's first developer conference on November 6 in San Francisco. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_Sam_Altman_from_OpenAI\">brief removal</a> of Sam Altman in late November didn't have a noticeable impact.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/12/pasted-image-0-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"528\"></figure><ul><li><strong>character.ai</strong>'s growth was similar to OpenAI, rising from the top 500 in early January to around #200 recently. <strong>Quillbot</strong> remained steady throughout the year, around #258.</li><li><strong>Poe AI</strong> peaked at #276 on June 18 and is now around #290. <strong>Claude AI</strong> was around #380 in November after a late August peak at #337.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id=\"socialmedia\">Social media: The Facebook (not X) effect</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>An analysis from <a href=\"https://datareportal.com/social-media-users\">Kepios</a> estimates that there are 4.95 billion social media users around the world in 2023, comprising 61.4% of the world population, so this category plays a big role in our everyday life as a central stage for communication, information, and general attention.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, social media platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram rank high in our most popular Internet properties and are featured in our Top 10 Overall Internet services list.</p><p>Within our Social Media category list, the top five remained the same as last year.

Reddit often challenged Discord on weekdays, while Discord was more popular on weekends. Following these are Pinterest (#9) and Kwai, the Chinese video app popular in Brazil, Indonesia, and other countries (#10). Here’s the top 10 chart across 2023:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/12/Untitled--1--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"638\"></figure><h3 id=\"a-twitter-or-x-drop-after-a-possible-football-or-soccer-peak\">A Twitter (or X) drop after a possible football (or soccer) peak</h3><p>Let's continue on social media, but leave its specific category and examine how social media services fared in our Overall ranking where bigger shifts between services are seen.</p><p>The graph below depicts the position of Instagram and Twitter in the Overall ranking. Instagram consistently ranked in the top 10, typically holding positions #8 or #9 with brief dips to #10 around May 2023.</p><p>X/Twitter, which reached as high as #8 overall last year following the start of the war in Ukraine, ended 2022 at #12 and continued its downward trend in 2023. It started between #12 and #16, lower than last year, and ended between #13 and #19. Here's how these two evolved in 2023:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/12/pasted-image-0--1--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"523\"></figure><p>We noticed that X/Twitter was particularly popular on weekends, peaking at #11 or #12 between April 15 and June 10. ​​Specifically, it ranked at #11 in the weekends before May 14 and then at #12 from May 14 to June 10. This coincides with key moments in European football competitions. However, after the European Champions League final on June 10, X/Twitter never reached those heights again.</p><p>Let’s explore this possible football (or soccer) Twitter trend. X/Twitter's rankings peaked around significant moments in the English Premier League (arguably the <a href=\"https://internationalbroadcasts.fandom.com/wiki/Premier_League\">most-watched sports league</a> in the world), particularly when Manchester City made crucial advances to their title after April 15. The trend lasted until the European Champions League final on June 10, where City's victory and historic <a href=\"https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0251-0e99b1ba85da-ec8053dc0a29-1000--who-has-won-a-treble-including-domestic-league-and-cup-title/\">treble</a> coincided with X/Twitter's final peak ranking of the year — the weekend of June 3, when there were already no Premier League games, and X/Twitter dropped to #13.</p><h3 id=\"alternatives-to-xtwitter-mastodon-threads-and-others\">Alternatives to X/Twitter: Mastodon, Threads, and others</h3><p>Tumblr, a more established platform than other recent alternatives, fluctuated between #125 and #153 in our Overall ranking, showing a downward trend. Close behind was an aggregation of several hundred Mastodon servers, ranking between #160 and #200.</p><p>Threads from Instagram/Meta (seen in the next chart), peaked at #227 on July 6 in our Overall ranking, then dropped but recovered to around #300 after late August, and did not make it into the top 10 social media services ranking for 2023. For context, Kwai (#10 in the Social Media ranking) usually ranks around our Overall top 50.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/12/pasted-image-0--2--2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"548\"></figure><p>Bluesky, a newer entrant, first appeared in our Top 500 in late August, with a first spike at #432 on September 19 and reaching the top 400 in November, peaking at #397 on November 19.

In our popular Internet services rankings, the dominance of giants like Google and Facebook, and the relevance of TikTok and others, underscore the continued influence of established players in shaping online interactions and content consumption. However, the rise of generative AI services, notably OpenAI’s ChatGPT, signals an exciting sector that is rapidly gaining traction. Let's see where generative AI services can go in 2024.</p><p>In the social media realm, X/Twitter seems to be losing some influence in our ranking but continues to be highly influential, and much higher than the direct competition. Mastodon, Threads, and others still have a long way to go to compete. Although not seen as direct microblogging competition, Discord and Reddit continue to show growth.</p><p>An emerging player, Temu, made significant strides in the E-commerce realm. In the cryptocurrency space, Binance lost momentum as CoinGecko gained traction. In the gaming and metaverse sectors, the highlights included Roblox’s consistency and Oculus's growth.</p><p>Looking ahead, the trends observed in 2023 set the stage for an even more interconnected and technologically advanced future. The growing importance of AI, the steadfast popularity of social media, and the evolving dynamics in e-commerce and financial services suggest a future where humans will have to continue to adapt to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.</p><p>Creating rankings is a team effort that comes with its own challenges and requires careful attention and frequent updates.
