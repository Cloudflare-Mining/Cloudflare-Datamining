Sum that question up across a lot of users in a lot of different countries, and you end up with a sense of the most popular websites and services in the world. In a nutshell, that’s what this blog post is about: how humans interacted with the online world in 2023 from what Cloudflare observed.</p><p>Building on similar reports we’ve done over the past two years, we have compiled a ranking of the top Internet properties of 2023. In addition to our overall ranking, we chose 9 categories to focus on. One of these is a new addition in 2023: Generative AI. Here are the 9 categories we’ll be digging into:</p><ol><li><p><a href=\"#generativeai\">Generative AI</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"#socialmedia\">Social Media</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"#ecommerce\">E-commerce</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"#videostreaming\">Video Streaming</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"#news\">News</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"#messaging\">Messaging</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"#metaversegaming\">Metaverse &amp; Gaming</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"#financialservices\">Financial Services</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"#cryptocurrencyservices\">Cryptocurrency Services</a></p></li></ol><p>Our method for calculating the results is the same as in <a href=\"/radar-2022-year-in-review/\">2022</a>: we analyze anonymized DNS query data from our <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/\">1.1.1.1</a> public <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/\">DNS resolver</a>, used by millions of people around the world. To build the lists of Internet services, we use two additional methods. First, we aggregate domains that belong to one online service. For instance, for Twitter/X, we include twitter.com, t.co, and x.com among others. Second, we reference our large <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains\">source list of domains</a> and identify the sites that provide services to humans. That means that our rankings do not include every domain seen in the data (for example, we exclude domains such as root-servers.net and cloudflare-dns.com). A site’s overall ranking is relative to other sites that meet these criteria; its rank within a category is relative to other sites in the same category. That’s important to note: just because a site has gone down in the rankings, it doesn’t necessarily mean its traffic has declined — it could just be that other sites&#39; traffic increased. Similarly, the inverse is true. What we’re doing here isn’t tracking absolute traffic, but rather, relative popularity.</p><p>With that, we can begin our analysis. Following the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT launch on November 30, 2022, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-generative-ai/\">Generative AI</a> has captivated both the world and the news. OpenAI is now close to ranking among our top 100 most popular Internet services overall, rising from #200 in January.</p><p>In e-commerce, low price and fast fashion marketplace Temu experienced similar growth, becoming the year&#39;s surprise by surpassing Shein and other major players, reaching #7 in its category. And Black Friday was the best day for several other e-commerce services, as well as payment services such as PayPal, Stripe and Klarna.</p><p>In social media, X/Twitter lost some ground in our Overall ranking, but maintained its status as a significant online discussion platform. New additions like Threads by Instagram, launched in July, are still gaining their footing in the category. Additionally, we observed notable news-related trends linked to events such as the March 2023 United States banking crisis, the Titan submersible implosion, the Wagner Group rebellion, and the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.</p><p>We close our report out with a discussion of a range of trends that don’t fit neatly into our other categories, including a look at Taylor Swift’s and Beyoncé websites — both of which appeared in our overall traffic rankings.</p><p>Keep reading for a detailed look at the evolution of trends throughout the year.

The #10 position changed more frequently, alternating between iCloud (for which we use domains such as icloud.com, distinct from apple.com), Netflix (mainly on weekends), and Microsoft Office.

In both the Financial Services and Cryptocurrency categories, we noticed Binance, a key cryptocurrency player, lost its leading position in 2023, dropping to #2 in November. The company faced challenges in July, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance#2020%E2%80%932023:_acquisitions_and_investments\">several top executives leaving</a>. Then, in November, US authorities filed a lawsuit against Binance, resulting in multiple charges and fines. In our Overall ranking, Binance&#39;s highest point was on April 19, the day after US Tax Day, ranking at #122. However, its rank fell later, though it slightly improved to around #140 by November.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6qLPb72qYBKXFtqPAz95zA/01e965735e03b28651435dc42bd3d504/pasted-image-0--10--1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"544\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"other-trends-from-our-overall-ranking-taylor-beyonce-github-and-spotifys-popularity\">Other trends from our overall ranking: Taylor, Beyoncé, GitHub and Spotify&#39;s popularity</h2>\n            <a href=\"#other-trends-from-our-overall-ranking-taylor-beyonce-github-and-spotifys-popularity\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Outside the categories we reviewed in the Year in Review, several notable trends emerged in our Overall ranking:</p><ul><li><p><b>Taylor Swift&#39;s</b> official site entered our top 500 on August 10 (#464), when she announced her album &#39;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_(Taylor%27s_Version)\">1989 (Taylor&#39;s Version)</a>&#39; in Los Angeles and on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1689521888903786496\">social media</a>.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Surprise!! 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is on its way to you 🔜! The 1989 album changed my life in countless ways, and it fills me with such excitement to announce that my version of it will be out October 27th.

It appeared only on June 15, but reached #346. In the news that day (and the day before), the Financial Times reported that economists at Danske Bank believed that Beyoncé&#39;s decision to start her world tour in Stockholm led to a surge in local hotel prices that resulted in inflation in Sweden, calling it &quot;astonishing for a single event&quot;. At the time, June 15, Beyoncé had a Cologne, Germany, concert, where a fan gender reveal also made the news.</p></li><li><p><b>GitHub</b> is a top 50 site in our Overall ranking, and it showed clear growth in 2023, moving from #49 to #42 in November. It reached its highest point at #36 on January 19, when it announced reaching <a href=\"https://github.blog/2023-01-25-100-million-developers-and-counting/\">100 million developers</a>, and had another peak on May 12 at #38.

However, our list ends on November 25, so we couldn&#39;t capture the impact of the recently launched Spotify Wrapped.</p></li><li><p><b>NASA</b>. This year, NASA continued to showcase images from the James Webb Space Telescope. The NASA website peaked in our ranking on October 12 at #160, the day before the scheduled launch of <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche\">NASA&#39;s Psyche mission</a>, aimed at exploring a unique metal-rich asteroid. Another peak occurred on April 28 at #172, coinciding with a broadcasted <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?527453-1/nasa-conducts-spacewalk-international-space-station\">spacewalk</a> at the International Space Station.</p></li><li><p><b>SpaceX</b>. SpaceX had its best and only notable days in our ranking (within the overall top 500) on April 17 (#412), followed by April 20 (#416). April 17 marked <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_integrated_flight_test_1\">SpaceX’s Starship orbital flight</a>&#39;s first attempt, which was aborted just before launch and then resumed on April 20.</p></li><li><p><b>Craigslist</b>. The American classified ads website saw a decline in our ranking this year, with its lowest point in November and its worst day on Black Friday, when it fell to #268.</p></li><li><p><b>DHL</b>. The courier service improved its ranking in 2023, with its best performance in November, peaking on Thanksgiving Day, November 23,  in the US at #211.</p></li><li><p><b>NFL</b> (National Football League). The NFL site had its first significant peak on April 29 at #189, the day of the NFL Draft, surpassing even the Super Bowl&#39;s popularity. This peak was matched only by weekends after September 10, when it climbed as high as #160.</p></li><li><p><b>Flightradar24</b>’s most-trafficked day was April 23, when an American Airlines flight made an <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-airlines-plane-catches-fire-bird-strike-emergency-landing/\">emergency landing</a> in Ohio due to an engine fire. It rose to #176 on that day.</p></li><li><p><b>Waze</b>. The traffic app had lower rankings between June and early September (summer in the Northern Hemisphere), peaking on March 19 at #142 and on October 2 at #145.</p></li><li><p><b>Tides &amp; Currents.</b> The US Weather Service peaked on August 29-30 at #215 during <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/floridas-gulf-coast-braces-major-hurricane-idalia-nears-landfall-2023-08-30/\">Hurricane Idalia</a>, described as &quot;an unprecedented event,&quot; as the storm approached Florida&#39;s Gulf Coast.</p></li></ul>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"wrap-up-2023-shifting-ai-and-e-commerce-tides\">Wrap up: 2023, shifting AI and e-commerce tides</h2>\n            <a href=\"#wrap-up-2023-shifting-ai-and-e-commerce-tides\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>The Internet plays a role in socializing, entertaining, working, communicating, learning, and staying informed when you most need it. In our popular Internet services rankings, the dominance of giants like Google and Facebook, and the relevance of TikTok and others, underscore the continued influence of established players in shaping online interactions and content consumption. However, the rise of generative AI services, notably OpenAI’s ChatGPT, signals an exciting sector that is rapidly gaining traction. Let&#39;s see where generative AI services can go in 2024.</p><p>In the social media realm, X/Twitter seems to be losing some influence in our ranking but continues to be highly influential, and much higher than the direct competition. Mastodon, Threads, and others still have a long way to go to compete. Although not seen as direct microblogging competition, Discord and Reddit continue to show growth.</p><p>An emerging player, Temu, made significant strides in the E-commerce realm. In the cryptocurrency space, Binance lost momentum as CoinGecko gained traction. In the gaming and metaverse sectors, the highlights included Roblox’s consistency and Oculus&#39;s growth.</p><p>Looking ahead, the trends observed in 2023 set the stage for an even more interconnected and technologically advanced future. The growing importance of AI, the steadfast popularity of social media, and the evolving dynamics in e-commerce and financial services suggest a future where humans will have to continue to adapt to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.</p><p>Creating rankings is a team effort that comes with its own challenges and requires careful attention and frequent updates. If you want to help us make these categorical rankings better, you can. <a href=\"mailto:radar@cloudflare.com\">Feedback</a> is appreciated, including regarding other categories to include in the 2024 Year in Review.</p><p><i>(Our data scientist, Sabina Zejnilovic, played a crucial role in accurately gathering the Internet services data and contributed to this blog post, as did David Belson with his guidance, along with many others.)</i></p>",
