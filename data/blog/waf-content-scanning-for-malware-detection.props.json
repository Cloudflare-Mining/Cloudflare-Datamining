It will be automatically rolled out to existing WAF Content Scanning customers before the end of March 2024.</p><p>In this blog post we will share more details about the new version of the feature, what we have improved, and reveal some of the technical challenges we faced while building it.

Initially, addressing this query posed a challenge since HTTP requests do not have a definition of a “file”, and scanning all incoming HTTP requests does not make sense as it adds extra processing and latency. So, we had to decide on a definition to spot HTTP requests that include files, or as we call it, “uploaded content”.</p><p>The WAF Content Scanning engine makes that decision by filtering out certain content types identified by heuristics. Any content types not included in a predefined list, such as <code>text/html</code>, <code>text/x-shellscript</code>, <code>application/json</code>, and <code>text/xml</code>, are considered uploaded content and are sent to the scanner for examination. This allows us to scan a <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/infer#supported-types\">wide range</a> of content types and file types without affecting the performance of all requests by adding extra processing. The wide range of files we scan includes:</p><ul><li><p>Executable (e.g., <code>.exe</code>, <code>.bat</code>, <code>.dll</code>, <code>.wasm</code>)</p></li><li><p>Documents (e.g., <code>.doc</code>, <code>.docx</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.ppt</code>, <code>.xls</code>)</p></li><li><p>Compressed (e.g., <code>.7z</code>, <code>.gz</code>, <code>.zip</code>, <code>.rar</code>)</p></li><li><p>Image (e.g., <code>.jpg</code>, <code>.png</code>, <code>.gif</code>, <code>.webp</code>, <code>.tif</code>)</p></li><li><p>Video and audio files within the 15 MB file size range.</p></li></ul><p>The file size scanning limit of 15 Megabytes comes from the fact that the in-line file scanning as a feature is running in real time, which offers safety to the web server and instant access to clean files, but also impacts the whole request delivery process. Therefore, it’s crucial to scan the payload without causing significant delays or interruptions; namely increased CPU time and latency.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"scaling-the-scanning-process-to-15-mb\">Scaling the scanning process to 15 MB</h2>\n      <a href=\"#scaling-the-scanning-process-to-15-mb\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In the early design of the product, we built a system that could handle requests with a maximum body size of 1 MB, and increasing the limit to 15 MB had to happen without adding any extra latency.

This will be in an in-memory buffer, or written to a temporary file if the size of the request body exceeds the NGINX configuration of <a href=\"https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_body_buffer_size\">client_body_buffer_size</a>. Then, our WAF engine executes the lookup_json_string function and returns the base64 string which is the content of the file key. The base64 string gets sent via Unix Domain Sockets to our malware scanner, which does MIME type detection and returns a verdict to the file upload scanning module.</p><p>This architecture had a bottleneck that made it hard to expand on: the expensive latency fees we had to pay. The request body is first buffered in NGINX and then copied into our WAF engine, where rules are executed. The malware scanner will then receive the execution result — which, in the worst scenario, is the entire request body — over a Unix domain socket. This indicates that once NGINX buffers the request body, we send and buffer it in two other services.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2OZumKn4Bar00t8BxfPuz6/bf2ffb663817b3092dccc2acd2701374/Screenshot-2024-03-07-at-12.31.52.png\" alt=\"Diagram showing the architecture of the early access version of WAF content scanning\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1149\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h3 id=\"new-architecture-for-the-general-availability-release\">New architecture for the General Availability release</h3>\n      <a href=\"#new-architecture-for-the-general-availability-release\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In the new design, the requirements were to scan larger files (15x larger) while not compromising on performance.

For example, the configuration “lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, “file”)”, will be represented roughly as:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\">{\n   Function: lookup_json_string\n   Args: [“file”]\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>This is achieved by walking the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree\">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> (AST) when the rule is configured, and deploying the sample struct above to our global network. The struct’s values will be read by the malware scanner, and rule execution and malware detection will happen within the same service. This means we don’t need to read the request body, execute the rule in the Ruleset Engine (RE) module, and then send the results over to the malware scanner.</p><p>The malware scanner will now read the request body from the temporary file directly, perform the rule execution, and return the verdict to the file upload scanning module.</p><p>The file upload scanning module populates these <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/about/content-scanning/#content-scanning-fields\">fields</a>, so they can be used to write custom rules and take actions. For example:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\">all(cf.waf.content_scan.obj_results[*] == &quot;clean&quot;)</pre></code>\n            <p>This module also enriches our logging pipelines with these fields, which can then be read in <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/about/\">Log Push</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/edge-log-delivery/\">Edge Log Delivery</a>, Security Analytics, and Firewall Events in the dashboard.
