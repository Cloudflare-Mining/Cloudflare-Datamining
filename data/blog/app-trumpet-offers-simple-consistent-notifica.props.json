It is that simple.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5HBIOhKhmT1oEH2tbMU5ev/e03229c915879b25fe204134e2fad849/trumpet-in-action.png.scaled500.png\" alt=\"App: Trumpet Offers Simple, Consistent Notification to Site Visitors\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Trumpet was conceived to scratch a personal itch. My clients often wanted to notify users of planned maintenance and downtime. This was usually done with a news article that only showed up on the front page. I needed something that would show up on all pages, which led me to making the first version of Trumpet.</p><p>My design goal for Trumpet was to make it very reliable, small, lightweight and without any dependencies on JavaScript libraries. A lot of the inspiration and code for the initial version of Trumpet came from humane-js, an excellent library without any dependencies. This was important for me. I didn&#39;t want sites to have to include large JavaScript libraries just to be able to show a small message, especially when the overall codebase of Trumpet was so small. I didn&#39;t want convenience for me to make the product worse.</p><p>Trumpet was originally made as a Google app engine project where the site that wanted to display the message included a JavaScript. This JavaScript then checked with the server if there was a message to be displayed. This had to overcome the usual cross site execution restrictions.</p><p>Then late last year I contacted CloudFlare about making Trumpet available on their platform. CloudFlare was very welcoming and helpful. Using their platform also meant that I could eliminate the Google app engine server, as CloudFlare can let users enter the message in the app configuration screen and embed this message with the JavaScript. This makes for a much faster and more reliable experience for the user.</p><p>If you use CloudFlare today, please check it out.
