These factors enable rapid adoption of cloud services which can lead to unintentional misconfigurations as IT teams struggle to keep up with the pace and complexity of these services. </p></li><li><p><b>Complexity of cloud environments:</b> Cloud infrastructure can be highly complex with multiple services and configurations to manage. For example, <a href=\"https://public.docs.kivera.io/docs/access-analyzer\"><u>AWS alone offers</u></a> 373 services with 15,617 actions and 140,000+ parameters, making it challenging for IT teams to manage settings accurately. </p></li><li><p><b>Decentralized management:</b> In large organizations, cloud infrastructure resources are often managed by multiple teams or departments. Without centralized oversight, inconsistent security policies and configurations can arise, increasing the risk of misconfigurations.</p></li><li><p><b>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):</b> CI/CD pipelines promote the ability to rapidly deploy, change and frequently update infrastructure. With this velocity comes the increased risk of misconfigurations when changes are not properly managed and reviewed.</p></li><li><p><b>Insufficient training and awareness:</b> Employees may lack the cross-functional skills needed for cloud security, such as understanding networks, identity, and service configurations.

Misconfigurations such as exposed storage buckets or improperly secured APIs offer attackers easy access to sensitive data and resources. Privilege abuse occurs when attackers gain unauthorized access through compromised credentials or poorly managed identity and access management (IAM) policies, allowing them to escalate their access and move laterally within the cloud environment. Additionally, unencrypted data enables attackers to intercept and decrypt data in transit or at rest, further compromising the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.</p><p>Here are some other vulnerabilities that organizations should address: </p><ul><li><p><b>Unrestricted access to cloud tenants:</b> Allowing unrestricted access exposes cloud platforms to data exfiltration by malicious actors. Limiting access to approved tenants with specific IP addresses and service destinations helps prevent unauthorized access.</p></li><li><p><b>Exposed access keys:</b> Exposed access keys can be exploited by unauthorized parties to steal or delete data. Requiring encryption for the access keys and restricting their usage can mitigate this risk.</p></li><li><p><b>Excessive account permissions:</b> Granting excessive privileges to cloud accounts increases the potential impact of security breaches. Limiting permissions to necessary operations helps prevent lateral movement and privilege escalation by threat actors.</p></li><li><p><b>Inadequate network segmentation:</b> Poorly managed network security groups and insufficient segmentation practices can allow attackers to move freely within cloud environments. Drawing boundaries around your cloud resources and tenants ensures that data stays within your organization.</p></li><li><p><b>Improper public access configuration:</b> Incorrectly exposing critical services or storage resources to the internet increases the likelihood of unauthorized access and data compromise. Preventing public access drastically reduces risk.</p></li><li><p><b>Shadow cloud infrastructure:</b> Abandoned or neglected cloud instances are often left vulnerable to exploitation, providing attackers with opportunities to access sensitive data left behind. Preventing untagged or unapproved cloud resources to be created can reduce the risk of exposure.</p></li></ul>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"limitations-of-existing-tools\">Limitations of existing tools </h2>\n            <a href=\"#limitations-of-existing-tools\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Many organizations turn to CSPM tools to give them more visibility into cloud misconfigurations. These tools often alert teams after an issue occurs, putting security teams in a reactive mode. Remediation efforts require collaboration between security teams and developers to implement changes, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This approach not only delays issue resolution but also exposes companies to compliance and legal risks, while failing to train employees on secure cloud practices. <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach-action-guide\"><u>On average</u></a>, it takes 207 days to identify these breaches and an additional 70 days to contain them. </p><p>Addressing the growing threat of cloud misconfigurations requires proactive security measures and continuous monitoring.
