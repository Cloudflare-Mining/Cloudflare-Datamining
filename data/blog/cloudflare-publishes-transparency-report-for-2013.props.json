The report does not include non-governmental requests.</p>\n<p>All totaled, the requests received affected fewer than 0.017% of the more than 2 million CloudFlare customers domains.</p>\n<p>CloudFlare operates a global network and is extremely mindful of the responsibility that comes with that privileged position.
