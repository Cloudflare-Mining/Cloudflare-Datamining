Over the years we have received a lot of feature requests from users, but two stand out: suggesting rate limiting thresholds and implementing a throttle behavior. Today we released both to Enterprise customers!</p><p>When creating a rate limit rule, one of the common questions is “what rate should I put in to block malicious traffic without affecting legitimate users?”. If your traffic is authenticated, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/api-gateway/\">API Gateway</a> will suggest thresholds based on auth IDs (such a session-id, cookie, or API key). However, when you don’t have authentication headers, you will need to create IP-based rules (like for a ‘/login’ endpoint) and you are left guessing the threshold. From today, we provide analytics tools to determine what rate of requests can be used for your rule.</p><p>So far, a rate limit rule could be created with log, challenge, or block action. When ‘block’ is selected, all requests from the same source (for example, IP) were blocked for the timeout period. Sometimes this is not ideal, as you would rather selectively block/allow requests to enforce a maximum rate of requests without an outright temporary ban. When using throttle, a rule lets through enough requests to keep the request rate from individual clients below a customer-defined threshold.</p><p>Continue reading to learn more about each feature.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"introducing-rate-limit-analysis-in-security-analytics\">Introducing Rate Limit Analysis in Security Analytics</h2>\n            <a href=\"#introducing-rate-limit-analysis-in-security-analytics\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>The <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/security-analytics/\">Security Analytics</a> view was designed with the intention of offering complete visibility on HTTP traffic while adding an extra layer of security on top. It&#39;s proven a great value when it comes to crafting custom rules. Nevertheless, when it comes to creating rate limiting rules, relying solely on Security Analytics can be somewhat challenging.</p><p>To create a rate limiting rule you can leverage Security Analytics to determine the filter — what requests are evaluated by the rule (for example, by filtering on mitigated traffic, or selecting other security signals like Bot scores). However, you’ll also need to determine what’s the maximum rate you want to enforce and that depends on the specific application, traffic pattern, time of day, endpoint, etc. What’s the typical rate of legitimate users trying to access the login page at peak time? What’s the rate of requests generated by a botnet with the same JA3 fingerprint scraping prices from an ecommerce site? Until today, you couldn’t answer these questions from the analytics view.</p><p>That’s why we made the decision to integrate a rate limit helper into Security Analytics as a new tab called &quot;Rate Limit Analysis,&quot; which concentrates on providing a tool to answer rate-related questions.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"high-level-top-statistics-vs-granular-rate-limit-analysis\">High level top statistics vs. granular Rate Limit Analysis</h3>\n            <a href=\"#high-level-top-statistics-vs-granular-rate-limit-analysis\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In Security Analytics, users can analyze traffic data by creating filters combining what we call <i>top statistics.</i> These statistics reveal the total volume of requests associated with a specific attribute of the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/\">HTTP requests</a>. For example, you can filter the traffic from the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/\">ASNs</a> that generated more requests in the last 24 hours, or you slice the data to look only at traffic reaching the most popular paths of your application.

You can select a rate defined on different time intervals, like one or five minutes, and the attribute of the request used to identify the rate, such as IP address, JA3 fingerprint, or a combination of both as this often improves accuracy. Once the attributes are selected, the chart displays the distribution of request rates for the top 50 unique clients (identified as unique IPs or JA3s) observed during the chosen time interval in descending order.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7iXu3aai6ibY25UWhtYUT1/9bef2b03e884668efbba3d8251cd4882/image2-1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the dashboard highlighting Rate limit analysis tab within Security Analytics view\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1571\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>You can use the slider to determine the impact of a rule with different thresholds.

For example, did the IP 192.0.2.23 exceed the rate of 20 requests per minute? Then block (or log) all requests from this IP for, let’s say, 10 minutes.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2VKfUoWJSGACGOz50fEsof/00da159c12b659159a2f883b81988a4d/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-11.16.42.png\" alt=\"Fixed action: once a threshold is reached, the action is performed for a customer-defined time duration.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1392\" height=\"230\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In some situations, this type of penalty is too severe and risks affecting legitimate traffic. For example, if a device in a corporate network (think about NAT) exceeds the threshold, all devices sharing the same IP will be blocked outright.</p><p>With <i>throttling</i>, rate limiting selectively drops requests to maintain the rate within the specified threshold. It’s like a leaky bucket behavior (with the only difference that we do not implement a queuing system). For example, throttling a client to 20 requests per minute means that when a request comes from this client, we look at the last 60 seconds and see if (on average) we have received less than 20 requests. If this is true, the rule won’t perform any action. If the average is already at 20 requests then we will take action on that request. When another request comes in, we will check again. Since some time has passed the average rate might have dropped, making room for more requests.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5nguPmj1apYY1lehsrbybF/3b954929b65a06a4e509ddc67689a874/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-11.17.18.png\" alt=\"Throttle behavior: for every request we assess whether the average rate is within the defined limit; if it is then we allow the request.\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1404\" height=\"216\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Throttling can be used with all actions: block, log, or challenge.
