	<p>The weather usually starts to become sunnier in most of the Northern Hemisphere in April. Springtime is here, and national holidays give people more time off. Between April 7 and 10, 2023, Easter was celebrated in dozens of countries worldwide. One week later, on April 16, it was time for the Orthodox Easter. Did the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter">Christian holiday</a> have an impact on Internet traffic trends?</p>
	<p>Spoiler alert: in several countries, it did. In Italy, Poland, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, the US, Mexico, and Australia, the Easter long weekend, with or without chocolate Easter bunnies or eggs, had one of the days with the least traffic of 2023 so far, more than 100 days into the year.</p>
	<p>If we had to pick “winners”, in terms of Easter online impact, we would have an Easter Sunday podium with: <b>Poland (22% drop in traffic), Italy (18%), France (16%)</b>. Mexico and Spain have special mentions, given that both were impacted during the “Semana Santa”, Holy Week.</p>
	<p>In terms of the Easter Sunday lunch, Italy seems to have no match, given that traffic dropped 38% at around 13:00 local time. Spain took the Good Friday lunch Internet impact prize (28% drop ~13:00).</p>
	<p>To do this comparison, we’re using Cloudflare’s worldwide data that could be seen and used in action (live) on <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Radar</a>, given that we help more than 20% of websites on the Internet. Although the charts presented are in UTC, we’re using local time in the text for local clarity.</p>
	<p>Next, we are selecting countries where Christianity is prominent, and there are clear Easter “egg” Internet trends. It will become evident that there are Easter days more impactful in some countries than Easter Sunday itself. We also show some Orthodox Easter (where Greece is most impacted), Ramadan and Passover trends. This is a year when several of the religious celebrations occurred around the same time, something that is not common, although it also happened last year. The last time before that was <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/rare-calendar-alignment-easter-passover-ramadan-2022-converge-1698384">33 years</a> prior.</p>

	<p>In 2023, Good Friday and Easter Saturday had a greater impact on Internet traffic in Italy than Easter Sunday. Specifically, traffic dropped by 16% on Good Friday compared to the previous week, making it more popular in terms of affecting Internet traffic.</p>
	<p>Easter Sunday is not in the top five of days. <a href="https://www.escuela-hablamos.com/en/easter-in-spain">Apparently</a>, it is not as significant as the “Viernes Santo” (Good Friday) and the “Semana Santa” (Holy Week), that started on Sunday, April 2, in most regions of Spain. Given that, it’s not surprising that Internet traffic was 28% lower than in the previous week at ~13:00 local time on Good Friday, April 7.</p>
	<p>Usually, mobile device traffic distribution is higher than desktop traffic only on the weekends, but during the “Semana Santa”, it was higher right after Wednesday, April 5 (“Jueves Santo”), until Monday, April 10. Although it's not a national holiday in Spain, it is in several regions.</p>

	<p>So far in 2023, Easter Saturday was the second day in the UK with the fewest Internet traffic requests after January 1. Usually, Saturdays are the days with the least traffic in the country. The Easter four-day long weekend generally had less traffic, particularly after the Good Friday holiday (traffic was 19% lower at 14:00 local time). Another curious trend about the UK that could show that people were missing the Internet: Tuesday, April 11, the day after the Monday Easter holiday, was the day with the most Internet traffic in the UK in 2023, so far.</p>

	<p>Similar to Spain, "Semana Santa," which takes place from April 2 to April 8, is a significant event in Mexico. This suggests that those days hold greater relevance in terms of Christian traditions there than Easter Sunday does — in Mexico, the Monday after is not a holiday. After January 1, Saturday, April 8, was the next day with the fewest traffic requests in the country. Unsurprisingly, we observed reduced traffic throughout that entire week. For example, on Thursday, April 6, during "Semana Santa," there were 13% fewer traffic requests compared to the previous week. Typically, in 2023, Sundays are the days with the least traffic in the country.</p>

	<p>In <b>Colombia</b>, another country with a predominantly Christian population, Easter weekend did not rank among the top five days with the least traffic.

	<p>Orthodox Easter is celebrated by Orthodox Christian communities on a different date than Easter, given that it follows the Julian calendar, instead of the Gregorian one. This year, it was celebrated this past Sunday, April 16 (on the Gregorian calendar). Predominantly Orthodox countries include Greece, Ukraine, Russia, Cyprus, and Serbia, among others, and are the world's <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/orthodox-christians-around-the-world-celebrate-easter/a-65340477">third largest</a> group of Christians.</p>
	<p>In Ukraine, traffic was 5% lower on April 16, Orthodox Easter, compared with April 9, Sunday Easter. Although those two days are not in our Top five list of 2023 days with the lowest traffic, so far, April 16 was the second Sunday with the least traffic since January, only matched by March 26. Bear in mind that with the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/one-year-of-war-in-ukraine">war, attacks on energy infrastructure</a> also have played a role in drops in the country’s Internet traffic. On Orthodox Easter, during lunch and dinner time, traffic was also lower than usual (compared to the previous Sunday), with a 10% drop at around 15:00 and 20:00 local time.</p>
	<p>In Greece, there’s no doubt whatsoever: April 16, Orthodox Easter, is the day in 2023, so far, with the lowest traffic. The Top five list of days with the least traffic, include four days of the Easter week:</p>
	<p><i>#1. Orthodox Easter, April 16 (-26%, compared with the previous week)</i>#2. January 1<i>#3. April 14</i><i>#4. April 15</i><i>#5. April 13</i></p>

	<p>And on Orthodox Easter, at ~14:00 local time, traffic was 42% lower than on the previous Sunday, and was 31% lower at ~21:00 on the same day.</p>
	<p>In Serbia, although Orthodox Easter was not one of the days with the lowest traffic so far, there was a 3% decrease in traffic compared to the previous Sunday, and during the past week, we saw less traffic than in the previous one. Also: at around 15:00 local time, on Orthodox Easter, traffic was 10% lower than on the previous Sunday.</p>

	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover">Passover</a>, known as Pesach in Hebrew, is one of the most important and widely observed Jewish holidays. It commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Ancient Egypt. Like Easter or Ramadan, the dates are not fixed. This year, it’s celebrated from April 5 at sundown, up to April 13. Internet traffic trends in the country clearly show that impact: April 5 was the #1 day with the least traffic in Israel so far.</p>

	<p>The highlight of Passover is the Seder, a ritual meal held on the first one or two nights of the holiday, in this case on Wednesday, April 5 and Thursday, April 6. The first day was clearly the one with the greatest impact, although the second is in our Top 15 days with the least traffic.</p>

	<p>The first Passover evening and the first Seder meal clearly had an impact on Internet traffic in Israel, given that between 19:00 and 20:00 local time, traffic dropped ~56% compared with the previous week. Typically, Fridays are the days with the least traffic in the country.</p>

	<p>Ramadan began three weeks ago, on the evening of March 22, and will last until April 21. For Muslims, it is a period of introspection, communal prayer and also of fasting every day from dawn to sunset. That means that people only eat at night (Iftar is the first meal after sunset that breaks the fast and often serves as a family or community event), and also before sunrise (Suhur).</p>
	<p>Last year, we wrote a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-ramadan-shows-up-in-internet-trends">trends deep dive blog post</a> about it over the month period, and unsurprisingly, we’re seeing similar trends this year. The impact on Internet traffic in some countries is clear. Traffic decreases during Iftar, the first meal after sunset, and increases before sunrise, as people wake up to eat.</p>
	<p>Now, let's see if the trend is consistent in 2023 for some countries. Looking at Turkey, on March 23 around 19:00 local time, traffic was 23% lower than the previous week, and was 74% higher at around 05:00. It’s similar in Syria, where there’s less traffic during the day.</p>

	<p>While in Turkey, we can also show the daily impact of the February 5 late night, magnitude 7.8 earthquake, on the Internet traffic of the country. We’ve followed that for a few weeks in our Radar Twitter account, and also in our latest <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q1-2023-internet-disruption-summary">Internet disruptions overview for Q1 2023 blog post</a>. The daily drop in traffic from Sunday, February 5, to the next day, was 26%, and it was 19% lower compared to the same day of the previous week. This next chart also shows that the #2 day with the least traffic in March, was March 23, when Ramadan started.</p>

	<p>Moving on to the United Arab Emirates, for example, Internet traffic on March 23 was 18% lower around 18:00 local time than in the previous week. And it was 42% higher at around 05:00, before sunrise. Usually, at least in the last month, traffic in the country is lower on Sundays.</p>

	<p>Internet traffic in Indonesia, the country with the largest Muslim population, sees similar patterns. On March 23, traffic dropped 20% at 18:00 local time and rose 31% at 04:00 before sunrise. Traffic is slightly lower than usual during the day since Ramadan started.</p>

	<p>Through Cloudflare’s view of the Internet, something that enables us to keep security, performance and privacy at a high level, we’ve seen how ancient traditions, beliefs and cultures continue to play a role in different countries on Earth, in 2023.</p>
	<p>It could be Easter, Passover or Ramadan, those traditions change Internet traffic patterns in several countries on Earth, simply because the Internet was made by and for humans, and is used by us every day. Sure, we’re not alone, we “live” there with bots and AI systems — in the past month, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com">29.5%</a> of traffic we saw was categorised as bots, the rest was human.</p>
