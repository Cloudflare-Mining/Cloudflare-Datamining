That’s why we are excited to announce that beginning today, anyone on CloudFlare can secure their traffic with DNSSEC in just one simple step.</p><p>This follows one year after <a href=\"/introducing-universal-ssl/\">we made SSL available for free</a>, and in one week, more than doubled the size of the encrypted web. Today we will do the same with DNSSEC, and this year, we’ll double the size of the DNSSEC-enabled web, bringing DNSSEC to millions of websites, for free.</p><p>If DNS is the phone book of the Internet, DNSSEC is the unspoofable caller ID. DNSSEC ensures that a website’s traffic is safely directed to the correct servers, so that a connection to a website is not intercepted by an on-path attack.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"solving-a-decades-old-vulnerability-in-dns\">Solving A Decades-Old Vulnerability In DNS</h3>\n            <a href=\"#solving-a-decades-old-vulnerability-in-dns\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Every website visit begins with a DNS query. When I visit cloudflare.com, my browser first needs to find the IP address:</p><p><code>cloudflare.com. 272 IN A 198.41.215.163</code></p><p>When DNS was invented in 1983, the Internet was used by only a handful of professors and researchers, and no one imagined that there could be foul play. Thus, DNS relies on sheer trust to operate; no matter what IP address you receive in return, your browser blindly trusts it and attempts to establish a TCP connection with that server.</p><p><code>cloudflare.com. 272 IN A **6.6.6.6**</code></p><p>A malicious wifi network, an attacker on your router, a compromised ISP, or any other on-path attack can manipulate this decades-old vulnerability in DNS to connect you to any server they choose. This lack of authentication in DNS has been exploited by countries to block banned websites, by intelligence agencies to intercept traffic, by service providers to inject ads, and by attackers to phish visitors and serve malware.</p><p>If we want to build an Internet we can trust, we must eliminate the possibility of this type of attack. The proven solution is DNSSEC. Our goal is to have DNSSEC enabled on every website on CloudFlare. It should be the expectation, not the exception, that DNS is secured by DNSSEC.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-trust-is-delegated-in-dnssec-and-how-it-should-be-automated\">How Trust Is Delegated In DNSSEC, And How It Should Be Automated</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-trust-is-delegated-in-dnssec-and-how-it-should-be-automated\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>In DNSSEC, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/\">trust is chained</a> down from the root zone, to the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/top-level-domain/\">Top Level Domain (TLD)</a>, to the domain, and then to any subdomain.

Therefore, to activate DNSSEC, a website owner needs to:</p><ul><li><p>Copy the keys from CloudFlare’s dashboard</p></li><li><p>Paste them in the registrar’s dashboard</p></li><li><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name-registrar/\">registrar</a> then updates the information contained in the registry with the new keys</p></li></ul><p>This part is problematic -- copying and pasting opens up the possibility to human error, and prevents the spread of DNSSEC on the web if the registrar still hasn’t added support in their interface for the protocol or our DNSSEC cipher choice.</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/puntcat\">@puntcat</a> can you guys *please* add support for algorithm 13 for DNSSEC so I can use <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudFlare\">@CloudFlare</a>?</p><p>— Evan Kinney (@evankinney) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evankinney/status/659115663752044545\">October 27, 2015</a></p></blockquote><p>If CloudFlare could instead communicate directly with the registry, we could activate DNSSEC for every website on CloudFlare automatically, a full <a href=\"http://www.datanyze.com/market-share/DNS/\">42% of managed DNS</a>.
