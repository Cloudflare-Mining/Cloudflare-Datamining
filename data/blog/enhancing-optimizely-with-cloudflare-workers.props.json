The test is designed via the Optimizely WYSIWYG editor, and is live within minutes. Common use cases include style updates, image swaps, headlines and other text changes. You can also write any custom JavaScript or CSS you want.</p><p>With client-side A/B testing, the browser downloads JavaScript that modifies the page as it’s loading.  To avoid “flash-of-unstyled-content” (FOUC), developers need to implement this JavaScript synchronously in their  tag.  This constraint, though, can lead to page performance issues, especially on slower connections and devices.  Downloading and executing JavaScript in the browser has a cost, and this cost increases if the amount of JavaScript is large.  With a normal Optimizely Web implementation, all experiments are included in the JavaScript loaded on every page.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1QMd8nkUV19B2n7iPIlIL4/7c38d11e9f19c543f69d7a37e6d3aa2e/Screen-Shot-2019-06-03-at-9.26.52-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1820\" height=\"1022\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>A traditional Optimizely implementation</p><p>With Workers, Optimizely can support many of these same use cases, but hoists critical logic to the edge to avoid much of the performance cost.

With Workers, you can implement feature rollouts by running the Optimizely JavaScript SDK at the edge.  The Worker is effectively a <a href=\"https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/content-delivery-networks#section-1-make-decisions-on-the-edge\">decision service</a>.  Instead of installing the JS SDK inside each <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/\">application service</a> where you might need to gate or roll out features, centralize instantiation in a Worker.</p><p>From your application, simply hit the Worker and the response will tell you whether a feature is enabled for that particular user.  In the example below, we supply via query parameters a <code>userId</code>, <code>feature</code>, and account-specific SDK <code>key</code> and the Worker responds with its decision in <code>result</code>.  Below is a sample Cloudflare Worker:</p>\n            <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">import { createManager } from &#039;../index&#039;\n\n/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;es2015&quot; /&gt;\n/// &lt;reference lib=&quot;webworker&quot; /&gt;\n\naddEventListener(&#039;fetch&#039;, (event: any) =&gt; {\n  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))\n})\n\n/**\n * Fetch and log a request\n * @param {Request} request\n */\nasync function handleRequest(request: Request): Promise&lt;Response&gt; {\n  const url = new URL(request.url)\n  const key = url.searchParams.get(&#039;key&#039;)\n  const userId = url.searchParams.get(&#039;userId&#039;)\n  const feature = url.searchParams.get(&#039;feature&#039;)\n  if (!feature || !key || !userId) {\n    throw new Error(&#039;must supply &quot;feature&quot;, &quot;userId&quot; and &quot;key&quot;&#039;)\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const manager = createManager({\n      sdkKey: key,\n    })\n\n    await manager.onReady().catch(err =&gt; {\n      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ status: &#039;error&#039; }))\n    })\n    const client = manager.getClient()\n\n    const result = await client.feature({\n      key: feature,\n      userId,\n    })\n\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(result))\n  } catch (e) {\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ status: &#039;error&#039; }))\n  }\n}</pre></code>\n            <p>This kind of setup is common for React applications, which may update store values based on decisions returned by the Worker. No need to force a request all the way back to origin.</p><p>All in all, using Workers as a centralized decision service can reduce the complexity of your Full Stack implementation and support applications that rely on heavy caching.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"how-to-improve-your-experimentation-setup\">How to Improve Your Experimentation Setup</h3>\n            <a href=\"#how-to-improve-your-experimentation-setup\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Both of the examples above demonstrate how Workers can provide speed and flexibility to experimentation and feature flagging.  But this is just the tip of the iceberg!  There are plenty of other ways you can use these two technologies together.
