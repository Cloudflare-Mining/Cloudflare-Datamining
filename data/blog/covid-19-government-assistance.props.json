As businesses, organizations and government agencies adjust to this new normal, we recognize the strain that this pandemic has put on the groups working to assist in virus mitigation and provide accurate information to the general public on the state of the pandemic.</p><p>At Cloudflare, this means ensuring that these entities have the necessary tools and resources available to them in these extenuating circumstances. On March 13, we <a href=\"/cloudflare-during-the-coronavirus-emergency/\">announced</a> our Cloudflare for Teams products will be free until September 1, 2020, to ensure Cloudflare users and prospective users have the tools they need to support secure and efficient remote work. Additionally, we have removed usage caps for existing Cloudflare for Teams users and are also providing onboarding sessions so these groups can continue business in this new normal.</p><p>As a company, we believe we can do more and have been thinking about ways we can support organizations and businesses that are at the forefront of the pandemic such as health officials and those providing relief to the public. Many organizations have reached out to us with COVID-19 related initiatives including the creation of symptom tracking websites, medical resource donations, and websites focused on providing updates on COVID-19 cases in specific regions.</p><p>During this time, we have seen an increase in applications for Project Galileo, an initiative we started in 2014 to provide free services to organizations on the Internet including humanitarian organizations, media sites and voices of political dissent. Project Galileo was started to ensure these groups stay online, as they are repeatedly targeted due to the work they do. Since March 16, we have seen a 40% increase in applications for the project of organizations related to COVID-19 relief efforts and information. We are happy to assist other organizations that have started initiatives such as these with ensuring the accessibility and resilience of their web infrastructure and internal team.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1zyVbOCpQGJJxWI6eNBuYC/4fdd5ebbb4afa64c523dda511068f3cf/40-increase-galileo.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1287\" height=\"636\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"risks-faced-to-government-agencies-web-infrastructure-due-to-covid-19-pandemic\">Risks faced to Government Agencies Web Infrastructure due to COVID-19 pandemic</h3>\n            <a href=\"#risks-faced-to-government-agencies-web-infrastructure-due-to-covid-19-pandemic\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>As COVID-19 has disrupted our lives, the Internet has allowed many aspects of our life to adapt and carry on. From health care, to academia, to sales, a working Internet infrastructure is essential for business continuity and the dissemination of information. At Cloudflare, we’ve witnessed the effects of this transition to online interaction. <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/builtforthis/\">In the last two months,</a> we have seen both a massive increase in Internet traffic and a shift in the type of content users access online. Government agencies have seen a 100% increase in traffic to their websites during the pandemic.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5bNkra5mfhn97Ym0gytmWs/6943bb762f51a6efe2aab40aa37cc954/image1-16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1019\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>This unexpected shift in traffic patterns can come with a cost. Essential websites that provide crucial information and updates on this pandemic may not have configured their systems to handle the massive surges in traffic they are currently seeing. Government agencies providing essential health information to citizens on the COVID-19 pandemic have temporarily gone offline due to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/u-s-health-agency-suffers-cyber-attack-during-covid-19-response\">increased traffic</a>. We’ve also seen examples of public service announcements and the sites of local governments providing unemployment resources unable to serve their traffic. In New Jersey, <a href=\"https://cbs6albany.com/news/coronavirus/new-yorkers-struggle-to-file-for-unemployment-as-coronavirus-closes-non-essential-business\">New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/coronavirus-outage-systems-traffic-unemployment\">Ohio</a>, websites that provide unemployment benefits and health insurance options for people who have recently been laid off have crashed due to large amounts of traffic and unprecedented demand.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2TFByMWK4K0a3pVyuMvi6Q/67e30126bc9086ff879a813746750b4d/image3-13.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1582\" height=\"1062\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p><i>To help process claims for unemployment benefits, New Jersey’s Department of Labor &amp; Workforce Development has created a schedule for applicants.</i></p><p>During the spread of COVID-19, government agencies have also experienced cyberattacks.</p><p>The Australian government’s digital platform for providing welfare services for Australian citizens, known as Mygov, was slow and inaccessible for a short period of time.
