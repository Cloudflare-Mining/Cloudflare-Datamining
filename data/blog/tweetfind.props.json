When I&#39;m not working on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/tweetfind\">@TweetFind.com</a>, a Twitter directory to bring Consumers and Businesses together, I work as a Computer Administrator for a High School in Santa Barbara, CA.</p><h3>How did you hear about CloudFlare?</h3><p>I heard about CloudFlare from a September 2010 Post on <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/cloudflare-wants-to-be-a-cdn-for-the-masses-and-takes-five-minutes-to-set-up/\">TechCrunch</a> when CloudFlare launched at <a href=\"http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/2010-sf/\">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a> The post mentioned how you can activate CloudFlare for your website in five minutes.</p><h3>Why did you join CloudFlare?</h3><p>From everything that I read, CloudFlare sounded really good. The articles said CloudFlare can have a big impact on improving your <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/overview.html\">siteperformance</a> instantly including faster page loading times, while also getting some <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans.html\">website security</a> features to your site.</p><h3>How many sites have you added to the CloudFlare network?</h3><p>I have hooked up <a href=\"http://www.tweetfind.com/\">TweetFind</a>, which is my largest website, and plan on connecting the rest of my sites in 2011.</p><h3>What kind of performance improvements have you seen with CloudFlare?</h3><p>I have seen tremendous improvements with TweetFind. My analytics shows that I&#39;ve shaved approximately 2 seconds off of my page loading time since joining CloudFlare. A few days after I joined CloudFlare, a number of my regular visitors emailed me to let me know that the site loaded much faster. Seeing all these positive results, I opted for the <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/plans.html\">Pro account</a> for only $20 per month, which is a great bargain.</p><h3>What&#39;s been the biggest surprise for you using Cloudflare?</h3><p>One of my biggest surprises is how easy it is to get up and running on CloudFlare. The process to add a domain and <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22047501-What-is-DNS-\">change my name servers</a> only took me about five minutes.</p><h3>What&#39;s your favorite CloudFlare feature?</h3><p>One of my favorite things about CloudFlare has been the support. Support has been very speedy from day one. The CloudFlare support team has been the best I&#39;ve seen in my 20+ years in the computer industry.[</p><p>](<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/damonbillian/5368614258/\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/damonbillian/5368614258/</a> &quot;Tweetfind CloudFlare Analytics by dbillian, on Flickr&quot;)If I have to pick one feature of CloudFlare that I enjoy the most, I would say the <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/forums/21319496-Reporting-Threat-Control-and-Analytics-\">web analytics</a> would be my favorite because Pro accounts update every 15 minutes. The analytics are easy to understand, let me capture other information that other web analytics programs don&#39;t, and let me see how much bandwidth I&#39;m saving by using CloudFlare.</p><h3>What would you recommend that new users to CloudFlare know?</h3><p>New users should try a free account first to see the benefits of beingpart of the CloudFlare community. Once new customers see the analyticsand benefits after a few days, they will see how the $20.00 per monthPro account is a bargain for more speed and protection.</p>",
