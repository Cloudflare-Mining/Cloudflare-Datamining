What this address looks like depends on the version of IP being used: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_4\">IPv4</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6\">IPv6</a>.</p><p>IPv4 was first deployed in 1983. It’s the IP version that gave birth to the modern Internet and still remains dominant today. IPv6 can be traced back to as early as 1998, but only in the last decade did it start to gain significant traction — rising from less than 1% to somewhere between 30 and 40%, depending on who’s reporting and what and how they’re measuring.</p><p>With the growth in connected devices far exceeding the number of IPv4 addresses available, <a href=\"/amazon-2bn-ipv4-tax-how-avoid-paying/\">and its costs rising</a>, the much larger address space provided by IPv6 should have made it the dominant protocol by now. However, as we’ll see, this is not the case.</p><p>Cloudflare has been a strong advocate of IPv6 <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2011/cloudflare-announces-the-automatic-ipv6-gateway/\">for many years</a> and, through <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a>, we’ve been closely following IPv6 adoption across the Internet. At three years old, Radar is still a relatively recent platform. To go further back in time, we can briefly turn to our friends at <a href=\"https://stats.labs.apnic.net/ipv6/XA\">APNIC</a><sup>1</sup> — one of the five Regional Internet Registries (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry\">RIRs</a>). Through their data, going back to 2012, we can see that IPv6 experienced a period of seemingly exponential growth until mid-2017, after which it entered a period of linear growth that’s still ongoing:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/37xEnfcqqKABkXWhnETnXK/30e3c5afa1d14896deb307d028785913/pasted-image-0--7--2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"700\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>IPv6 adoption is slowed down by the lack of compatibility between both protocols — devices must be assigned both an IPv4 <i>and</i> an IPv6 address — along with the fact that virtually all devices on the Internet still support IPv4. Nevertheless, IPv6 is critical for the future of the Internet, and continued effort is required to increase its deployment.</p><p>Cloudflare Radar, like APNIC and most other sources today, publishes numbers that primarily reflect the extent to which Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have deployed IPv6: the <i>client side</i>. It’s a very important angle, and one that directly impacts end users, but there’s also the other end of the equation: the <i>server side</i>.</p><p>With this in mind, we invite you to follow us on a quick experiment where we aim for a glimpse of server side IPv6 adoption, and how often clients are actually (or likely) able to talk to servers over IPv6. We’ll rely on DNS for this exploration and, as they say, the results may surprise you.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"ipv6-adoption-on-the-client-side-from-http\">IPv6 Adoption on the Client Side (from HTTP)</h3>\n            <a href=\"#ipv6-adoption-on-the-client-side-from-http\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>By the end of October 2023, from Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage?dateStart=2023-08-01&dateEnd=2023-10-31\">perspective</a>, IPv6 adoption across the Internet was at roughly <b>36%</b> of all traffic, with slight variations depending on the time of day and day of week. When excluding bots the estimate goes up to just over 46%, while excluding humans pushes it down close to 24%.

But large websites and content sources also have a critical role to play in enabling IPv6-capable clients to use IPv6 more often, as <b>39.2%</b> of queries for domains in the Radar <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains\">Top 100</a> (representing over half of all A and AAAA queries to 1.1.1.1) are still limited to IPv4-only responses.</p><p>On the road to full IPv6 adoption, the Internet isn’t quite there yet. But continued effort from all those involved can help it to continue to move forward, and perhaps even accelerate progress.</p><p><i>On the server side, Cloudflare has been helping with this worldwide effort for many years by providing free </i><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/network/understanding-and-configuring-cloudflares-ipv6-support/\"><i>IPv6 support</i></a><i> for all domains. On the client side, the </i><a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/\"><i>1.1.1.1 app</i></a><i> automatically enables your device for IPv6 even if your ISP doesn’t provide any IPv6 support. And, if you happen to manage an IPv6-only network, 1.1.1.1’s </i><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/infrastructure/ipv6-networks/\"><i>DNS64 support</i></a><i> also has you covered.</i></p><p>***</p><p><sup>1</sup>Cloudflare’s public DNS resolver (1.1.1.1) is operated in partnership with APNIC. You can read more about it in the original <a href=\"/dns-resolver-1-1-1-1/\">announcement blog post</a> and in 1.1.1.1’s <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/\">privacy policy</a>.</p><p><sup>2</sup>There’s more information on how DNS works in the “<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/\">What is DNS?</a>” section of our website. If you’re a hands-on learner, we suggest you take a look at Julia Evans’ “<a href=\"https://messwithdns.net/\">mess with dns</a>”.</p><p><sup>3</sup>Any recursive resolver will already know the IP addresses of the <a href=\"https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers\">13 root servers</a> beforehand. Cloudflare also participates at the topmost level of DNS by <a href=\"/f-root/\">providing anycast service to the E and F-Root instances</a>, which means 1.1.1.1 doesn’t need to go far for that first lookup step.</p><p><sup>4</sup>When using the <a href=\"https://one.one.one.one/\">1.1.1.1 app</a>, all four IP addresses are configured automatically.</p><p><sup>5</sup>For simplification, we assume the amount of IPv6-only clients is still negligibly small. It’s a reasonable assumption in general, and other datasets available to us confirm it.</p><p><sup>6</sup>1.1.1.1, like other recursive resolvers, returns adjusted TTLs: the record’s original TTL minus the number of seconds since the record was last cached. Empty A and AAAA answers get cached for the amount of time defined in the domain’s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-soa-record/\">Start of Authority</a> (SOA) record, as specified by RFC 2308.</p>",
