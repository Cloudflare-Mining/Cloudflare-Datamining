Workers integrates with other Cloudflare offerings helping you route requests, take action on bots, <a href=\"/sending-email-from-workers-with-mailchannels\">send an email,</a> or <a href=\"/announcing-route-to-workers\">route and filter emails</a>, just to name a few.</p><p>There are times when you’ll want to use multiple Workers to perform an action, Workers now have the ability to <a href=\"/service-bindings-ga\">call another Worker</a>. And while that Worker is sitting idly you aren’t charged. If serverless computing is about paying for what you use, why should you be charged when a Worker is waiting for a response?</p><p>Serverless compute works great for an application that’s in production, but what about when you’re in development?  You need the ability to run and test locally, that’s why we’ve announced that the <a href=\"/workers-open-source-announcement\">Workers runtime will be available via an open-source license</a> later this year.</p><p>But it’s not just the flexibility to run locally that’s important, the worry of vendor lock-in is real. You need the ability to move your application without significant efforts, that’s where the <a href=\"/introducing-the-wintercg\">WinterCG</a> comes in. Cloudflare is working with core contributors from Deno and Node.js to create server-side API standards to enable just this.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h3 id=\"storage\">Storage</h3>\n            <a href=\"#storage\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        <p>Applications, of course, cannot exist without storage. And when it comes to storage, there is no one-size-fits-all solution: <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-object-storage/\">object storage</a> is great for images, but maybe not for storing user information; meanwhile, databases are great for storing user information, but not videos, and even when it comes to databases, there are so many kinds.  Developers need a variety of storage solutions, there’s no one-size-fits all storage offering.</p><p>As of Platform Week we expanded our storage products, to include <a href=\"/r2-open-beta\">R2 (which is now in beta)</a>, and <a href=\"/introducing-d1\">D1 SQLite database</a>. These are in addition to the existing products, such as Workers KV, Durable Objects, and even Cloudflare’s cache!</p><p>You have the flexibility to choose the right tool for the task.

Too much time is spent waiting. Waiting for builds to compile, when only a few lines of code were changed only to find out there was an error. Pages now reduces your waiting time with a <a href=\"/cloudflare-pages-build-improvements/\">new build infrastructure</a>, and the ability to view logs as a build is in progress to immediately see if something has gone wrong. (And speaking of logs, did you know you can <a href=\"/logs-r2\">store your logs on R2</a>?)</p><p>To get started with Pages, you can either use our Git-integrations or <a href=\"/cloudflare-pages-direct-uploads\">deploy pre-built assets directly.</a> Functionality on your static sites can be extended via Workers or the new <a href=\"/cloudflare-pages-plugins\">Pages Plugins</a>.</p><p>If you don’t have a Jamstack application, we still have services related to media (which is an essential part of any website). Store, resize, and optimize your Images or <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/solutions/live-streaming/\">deliver live streams</a>.</p><p>In addition to building and delivering the applications there is a host of observability solutions to view how everything is performing. The reliability of your systems is impacted when you don’t have visibility into how they are performing.
