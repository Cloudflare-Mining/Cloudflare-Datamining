	<p>Recently, I spoke at the <a href="http://www.dotgo.eu">dotGo 2014</a> conference in Paris and my colleague (and creator of OpenResty) Yichun Zhang spoke at the first <a href="http://nginx.com/nginxconf">NGINX conference</a> in San Francisco.</p>
	<p>If you need to take a break, go grab a drink and enjoy one of these two talks.</p>
	<h4>The Latest and Greatest from ngx_lua: New Features &amp; Tools</h4>
	<p>Tired of writing NGINX C-modules or setting-up back-end application servers? The ngx_lua module was created to save time and pain, while opening up new possibilities in the world of NGINX. The ngx_lua module embeds the Lua dynamic language into the NGINX core, turning NGINX into a highly scriptable proxy server. Many use it as a non-blocking full-stack web application server as well--also known as OpenResty.</p>
	<p>Led by ngx_lua co-creator and sole-maintainer, CloudFlare’s Yichun Zhang, this presentation will introduce all the latest features implemented in the ngx_lua module as well as other new tools. Yichun will focus on features including: light threads, websockets, timers, NGINX worker initialization hooks, SSL/TLS coroutine-based sockets (or “cosockets”), full-duplex cosockets and more.</p>
	<p>The session wraps-up covering new advanced tools to troubleshoot and profile ngx_lua-based systems including dynamic tracing utilities based on Systemtap and GDB extension commands.</p>
	<h4>I came for the easy concurrency; I stayed for the easy composition</h4>
	<p>In this talk I told the story of a small Go program written to solve a problem at CloudFlare and how it evolved.</p>
