	<p>As a large data processing country, Germany is at the forefront of security and privacy regulation in Europe and sets the tone for other countries to follow. Analyzing and meeting the requirements to participate in Germany’s cloud security industry requires adherence to international, regional, and country-specific standards. Cloudflare is pleased to announce that we have taken appropriate organizational and technical precautions to prevent disruptions to the availability, integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of Cloudflare’s production systems in accordance with BSI-KritisV. TÜViT, the auditing body tasked with auditing Cloudflare and providing the evidence to BSI every two years. Completion of this audit allows us to comply with the NIS Directive within Germany.</p>
	<h3 id="why-do-cloud-companies-operating-in-germany-need-to-go-through-a-bsi-audit">Why do cloud companies operating in Germany need to go through a BSI audit?</h3>
	<p>In 2019, Cloudflare registered as an Operator of Essential Services’ under the EU Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive). The NIS Directive is cybersecurity legislation with the goal to enhance cybersecurity across the EU. Every member state has started to adopt national legislation for the NIS Directive and the criteria for compliance is set individually by each country. As an ‘Operator of Essential Services’ in Germany, Cloudflare is regulated by the <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html" target="_blank">Federal Office for Information Security</a> (The BSI) and must adhere to the requirements set by The BSI.</p>
	<h3 id="what-does-the-audit-prove">What does the audit prove? </h3>
	<p>This audit includes a thorough review of Cloudflare’s security controls in the following areas:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Asset Management</li>
		<li>Risk Analysis</li>
		<li>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</li>
		<li>Personnel and Organizational Security</li>

		<li>Network Security</li>
		<li>Security Authentication</li>
		<li>Incident Response</li>

	</ul>
	<p>In addition to an audit of Cloudflare’s security controls in the aforementioned areas, TÜViT also conducted a thorough review of Cloudflare’s Information Security Management System (ISMS).</p>
	<p>By having these areas audited, German customers can rest assured that Cloudflare respects the requirements put forth by the governing bodies tasked with protecting their data.</p>
	<h3 id="are-there-any-additional-german-specific-audits-on-the-horizon">Are there any additional German-specific audits on the horizon?</h3>
	<p>Yes. Cloudflare is currently undergoing an independent third-party audit for the Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalog (C5) certification. The C5 was introduced by BSI Germany in 2016 and reviews operational security within cloud services. Industries that place a high level of importance on C5 include cloud computing and German federal agencies.
