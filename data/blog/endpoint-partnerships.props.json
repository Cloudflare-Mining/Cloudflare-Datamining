The terms endpoint security, device security, device health, or device posture are often used interchangeably, but all mean the same — they are a collection of signals that help decide whether a particular device, say a laptop or a mobile phone, is secure or not. This includes signals and attributes like version of the operating system, date of the last patch, disk encryption status, inventory of installed applications, status of anti-malware or endpoint security provider, and date of the last malware scan.</p><p>Understanding these signals, especially across all company issued devices — also known as the device fleet — is important and allows security and IT teams to find devices that are outdated and require patching, or when a malware infection has occurred and needs remediation. Using Cloudflare for Teams, these signals can also be used to make network access decisions. For example, to restrict non-company issued devices from accessing sensitive applications, an access policy can be created that compares the device’s serial number with the company’s device inventory. Only if the serial number matches is the user granted access.</p><p>Our WARP client already checks for some of these attributes, like serial number and device location, and ensures traffic is encrypted with WARP. With our new integrations, customers get an additional layer of security by requiring that a device runs, for example, a CrowdStrike or VMware Carbon Black agent before granting the device access to a resource protected by Cloudflare. By combining signals from WARP and our partners’ endpoint security platforms, we can ensure that a device is both company sanctioned and free of malware, and therefore considered a secured device.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/39EkDER3TfWZHOlXczGHpo/f3f03d60df2a763289c5686843919cd2/image6-13.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1202\" height=\"505\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><blockquote><p>In today’s work-from-anywhere business culture, the risk of compromise has substantially increased as employees and their devices are continuously surrounded by a hostile threat environment outside the office walls. Through our integration with Cloudflare, organizations can leverage the power of the CrowdStrike Falcon platform to accurately allow dynamic conditional access to applications, delivering end-to-end Zero Trust protection across endpoints, workloads and applications to stop attacks in real-time.— <b>Patrick McCormack, Senior Vice President, Cloud Engineering, CrowdStrike</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The VMware Carbon Black Cloud consolidates multiple endpoint and workload security offerings into a single, cloud native platform. Leveraging VMware Carbon Black Cloud, Cloudflare can help customers secure and manage devices connecting to their cloud and Zero Trust networks.<b>— Tom Corn, Senior Vice President, Security Business Unit, VMware</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Enterprises have come to terms with the notion of a disintegrating traditional perimeter. The distributed and dynamic perimeter of today requires a fundamentally new approach to security. In partnership with Cloudflare, our AI-powered cybersecurity platform offers modern enterprises a more robust zero trust security solution that spans the devices, the network, and the mission critical applications enterprises rely on.<b>— Chuck Fontana, SVP Business &amp; Corporate Development, SentinelOne</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Zero Trust security architectures started at the network level with segmentation and enforcement, but as corporate resources and data increasingly live on endpoints, a zero trust architecture must take both the endpoint and the network into consideration. Knowing the identity of the endpoint, as well as knowing that it’s up-to-date, hardened against security threats and hasn’t been compromised, is paramount in ensuring secure access to an organization&#39;s resources.<b>— Pete Constantine, Chief Product Officer, Tanium</b></p></blockquote>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#how-does-it-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>Our integrations are simple.

Once the rules are in place, WARP will check to see if the endpoint security software is running on the device and communicate the status to Access. Access will then use the status of the device’s endpoint security software to either allow or deny access to the secured application. If the device is running your organization&#39;s endpoint security software, access will be granted.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5KSL1Otc0UCyVrqmI7dP0U/1b49e07e5e56d93ca6a6cab5a441481a/image7-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1868\" height=\"918\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>These Zero Trust checks can be layered with features like MFA and User Identity to thwart stolen credentials or other malicious access attempts.</p>\n    <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n      <h2 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n      <a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n        <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <p>In future releases, we will integrate additional security signals from our newly launched partners — such as <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/white-papers/falcon-zero-trust-risk-score/\">CrowdStrike’s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.carbonblack.com/resources/understanding-the-kenna-security-vulnerability-risk-score/\">VMware Carbon Black’s</a> risk scores — to provide even more fine-grained control over which devices can get access to protected applications.
