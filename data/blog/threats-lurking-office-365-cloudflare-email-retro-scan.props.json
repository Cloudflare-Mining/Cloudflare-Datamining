Organizations have an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/\">email security tool</a> or use Microsoft’s built-in protection but do not understand how effective their current solution is. We find that these tools often let malicious emails through their filters increasing the risk of compromise within the company.</p><p>In our pursuit to help build a better Internet, we are enabling Cloudflare customers to use Retro Scan to scan messages within their inboxes using our advanced machine learning models for free. Our Retro Scan will detect and highlight any threats we find so that customers can clean up their inboxes by addressing them within their email accounts. With this information, customers can also implement additional controls, such as using Cloudflare or their preferred <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/email-security-services/\">solution</a>, to prevent similar threats from reaching their mailbox in the future.</p>\n          <div class=\"flex anchor relative\">\n            <h2 id=\"running-a-retro-scan\">Running a Retro Scan</h2>\n            <a href=\"#running-a-retro-scan\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"relative sm:absolute sm:-left-5\">\n              <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\"></path></svg>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <p>Customers can navigate to the Cloudflare dashboard where they will see under the Area 1 tab the Retro Scan option:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2Ts8XaDTCCbeQnXHaLcDvB/90603b4320dc814a1c9ffa9c9d98ee06/image4-20.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1921\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>To be able to access the messages to scan, Cloudflare needs authorization to be able to scan messages.
