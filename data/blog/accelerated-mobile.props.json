		"html": "<p>In 2017, we&#39;ve predicted that more than half of the traffic to Cloudflare&#39;s network will come from mobile devices. Even if they are formatted to be displayed on a small screen, the mobile web is built on traditional web protocols and technologies that were designed for desktop CPUs, network connections, and displays. As a result, browsing the mobile web feels sluggish compared with using native mobile apps.</p><p>In October 2015, the team at Google announced <a href=\"http://ampproject.org\">Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)</a>, a new, open technology to make the mobile web as fast as native apps. Since then, a large number of publishers have adopted AMP. Today, 600 million pages across 700,000 different domains are available in the AMP format.</p><p>The majority of traffic to this AMP content comes from people running searches on Google.com. If a visitor finds content through some source other than a Google search, even if the content can be served from AMP, it typically won&#39;t be. As a result, the mobile web continues to be slower than it needs to be.</p><h4>Making the Mobile Web App-Quick</h4><p>Cloudflare&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/website-optimization/accelerated-mobile-links/\">Accelerated Mobile Links</a> helps solve this problem, making content, regardless of how it&#39;s discovered, app-quick. Once enabled, Accelerated Mobile Links automatically identifies links on a Cloudflare customer&#39;s site to content with an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/website-optimization/accelerated-mobile-links/\">AMP</a> version available. If a link is clicked from a mobile device, the AMP content will be loaded nearly instantly.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5ieCvJzcYWwJ2YOKbUrKFZ/1fac6ae0fc5cd83b6e7936a1050baeeb/amp-configuration-1.png\" alt=\"Enabling Accelerated Mobile Links on Cloudflare\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1548\" height=\"514\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>To see how it works, try viewing this post from your mobile device and clicking any of these links:</p><ul><li><p><b>TechCrunch:</b> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/11/cloudflare-explains-how-fbi-gag-order-impacted-business/\">Cloudflare explains how FBI gag order impacted business</a></p></li><li><p><b>ZDNet:</b> <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/cloudflare-offers-http2-server-push-to-boost-internet-speeds/\">CloudFlare figured out how to make the Web one second faster</a></p></li><li><p><b>The Register:</b> <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/21/cloudflare_apologizes_for_telia_screwing_you_over/\">CloudFlare apologizes for Telia screwing you over</a></p></li><li><p><b>AMP 8 Ball:</b> <a href=\"https://amp8ball.com/\">Ask The Amp Magic 8-Ball A Yes Or No Question.</a></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4LVE0NPtwr0c0kluYKwhAR/d4e766255a880d8b82cfa4fdcfbe4328/AML_animated_demo.gif\" alt=\"Accelerated Mobile Links animated demo\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"378\" height=\"666\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure></li></ul><h4>Increasing User Engagement</h4><p>One of the benefits of Accelerated Mobile Links is that AMP content is loaded in a viewer directly on the site that linked to the content. As a result, when a reader is done consuming the AMP content closing the viewer returns them to the original source of the link. In that way, every Cloudflare customers&#39; site can be more like a native mobile app, with the corresponding increase in user engagement.</p><p>For large publishers that want an even more branded experience, Cloudflare will offer the ability to customize the domain of the viewer to match the publisher&#39;s domain. This, for the first time, provides a seamless experience where AMP content can be consumed without having to send visitors to a Google owned domain. If you&#39;re a large publisher interested in customizing the Accelerated Mobile Links viewer, you can contact <a href=\"mailto:amp-publisher@cloudflare.com\">Cloudflare&#39;s team</a>.</p><h4>Innovating on AMP</h4><p>While Google was the initial champion of AMP, the technologies involved are <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml\">open</a>. We worked closely with the Google team in developing Cloudflare&#39;s Accelerated Mobile Links as well as our own AMP cache. Malte Ubl, the technical lead for the AMP Project at Google said of our collaboration:</p><p><i>&quot;Working with Cloudflare on its AMP caching solution was as seamless as open-source development can be. Cloudflare has become a regular contributor on the project and made the code base better for all users of AMP. It is always a big step for a software project to go from supporting specific caches to many, and it is awesome to see Cloudflare’s elegant solution for this.&quot;</i></p><p>Cloudflare now powers the only <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-cache-guidelines.md\">compliant</a> non-Google AMP cache with all the same performance and security benefits as Google.</p><p>In the spirit of open source, we&#39;re working to help develop updates to the project to address some of publishers&#39; and end users&#39; concerns. Specifically, here are some features we&#39;re developing to address concerns that have been expressed about AMP:</p><ul><li><p>Easier ways to share AMP content using publisher&#39;s original domains</p></li><li><p>Automatically redirecting desktop visitors from the AMP version back to the original version of the content</p></li><li><p>A way for end users who would prefer not to be redirected to the AMP version of content to opt out</p></li><li><p>The ability for publishers to brand the AMP viewer and serve it from their own domain</p></li></ul><p>Cloudflare is committed to the AMP project. Accelerated Mobile Links is the first AMP feature we&#39;re releasing, but we&#39;ll be doing more over the months to come. As of today, Accelerated Mobile Links is available to all Cloudflare customers for free. You can enable it in your <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/a/performance/\">Cloudflare Performance dashboard</a>. Stay tuned for more AMP features that will continue to increase the speed of the mobile web.</p>",
