<p><strong>About the role</strong></p>
<p>Cloudflare's dashboard is how millions of customers experience our network — from their first deployment to managing global infrastructure at scale. As the Senior Product Manager for Dashboard Growth and Adoption, you will lead the reinvention of this experience for an AI-first world.</p>
<p>This isn't a role about adding AI features to an existing product. It's about rethinking the dashboard from first principles: What does a great customer experience look like when AI can understand intent, take action, and handle complexity on behalf of the user? How does the interface evolve when agents — not just humans — will eventually be the primary actors? Your job is to answer those questions by shipping, measuring, and iterating fast.</p>
<p>You will use AI tools for the majority of your own work — prototyping, debugging, writing specs, analyzing experiments — and you will build products that bring that same leverage to our customers. This role sits on the Platform Product team.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h3><strong>Problems you may face:</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Time to value: How do we get users — from solo developers to enterprise teams — from sign-up to their first successful outcome as fast as possible, across dozens of complex use cases?</li>
	<li>Natural language as interface: To what extent do we evolve the dashboard from a traditional UI to one where users can manage their entire infrastructure through conversation? Where does natural language win, and where does it get in the way? How to maximize customer outcomes by partnering with other teams?</li>
	<li>AI-first (and soon, Agent-first) design: How do we redesign the dashboard for humans who direct and supervise AI and agents to act on their behalf, not just humans who click through forms?</li>
	<li>AI-powered velocity: How do you use AI coding agents to prototype, ship experiments faster than traditional development cycles, and to make better decisions to take customer experience to the next level?</li>
	<li>Platform as canvas: How can the dashboard give Cloudflare's internal product teams a powerful, flexible foundation to deliver great experiences — without the platform becoming a constraint?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Key Competencies:</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>AI-first builder. You start every task with AI tools. You're comfortable feeding error logs into agents, building your own internal tools, and acting as a rigorous reviewer for AI-generated code and content. You use AI to move faster — and you hold the output to a high standard.</li>
	<li>Agent-first product thinking. You don't just think about what users do today — you think about what happens when agents do it for them. You have a point of view on how interfaces, workflows, and trust models change in an agentic world, and you can translate that into a concrete roadmap.</li>
	<li>UX for AI interfaces. You know the difference between a natural language interface that feels magical and one that feels like a chatbot bolted onto a form. You prioritize how it works over how it looks. You are committed to ending "shipping the org chart" and instead building workflows centered on user intent.</li>
	<li>Experimentation and velocity. You thrive on A/B testing and rapid prototyping. You make data-informed decisions and constantly measure impact on retention and adoption. You don't wait for perfect — you ship, learn, and iterate.</li>
	<li>Data fluency: You can build your own dashboards and write your own SQL. You don't wait for an analyst to tell you if an experiment worked.</li>
	<li>Technical taste and discretion. You understand that AI can build quickly, but you ensure every feature shipped is elegant and actually solves a customer problem. You have a high bar for craft and can define and communicate a clear UX vision to engineers and designers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Points:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Coding proficiency: You're comfortable using coding agents to build functional prototypes or fix bugs yourself, rather than just filing tickets.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>UX credibility: You understand the modern frontend stack well enough to hold your own with engineers. An engineering background or experience shipping your own web product is a strong signal.</li>
	<li>At Cloudflare it’s pretty helpful to understand how the Internet really works at layers 2 through 7. If you don’t have this, be prepared to speak with mastery about another realm of similar complexity.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>
