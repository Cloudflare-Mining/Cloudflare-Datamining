<p><strong>About Product Management at Cloudflare&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As a<strong> Senior Product Manager at Cloudflare</strong>, you are responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare sit at the intersection of software development, design, and business strategy. We shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, create a launch plan with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, or pair with an engineer on implementation. We have ultimate responsibility for understanding our client needs, influencing business strategy, feature specification, and working with engineering to develop our software.</p>
<p>As a Senior Product Manager within the Application Performance team, you will own a critical part of our comprehensive platform that ensures web properties, applications, and networks are fast, reliable, and intelligent. This portfolio spans foundational capabilities like CDN optimization and Origin Shielding, advanced low-latency application delivery, and customer-facing data products built on real-world usage. You will set the strategic direction for how Cloudflare eliminates latency and provides the authoritative source of truth on performance for applications running across our global network.</p>
<h4>About the role</h4>
<p>As Senior Product Manager <strong>on the Application Performance team</strong>, you’ll help shape a key part of our core product experience. This role requires a candidate who can navigate complex technical domains—from TCP/IP protocols and caching architectures to data analytics and user experience—and translate those into clear, marketable features. You will define the roadmap for one or more core services that impact every byte of traffic processed by Cloudflare. You will collaborate closely with engineering teams to leverage our massive network footprint and unique traffic insights to deliver features that fundamentally change how the internet operates, ultimately accelerating adoption for customers ranging from individual developers to the world's largest enterprises.</p>
<p><strong>What you'll do</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Own your space. You will own the priorities and scope, partnering with a high performing engineering team focused on one of Cloudflare’s Application Performance products.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Connect the pieces. Product managers are a nerve center at Cloudflare, responsible for connecting engineering, program management, marketing, revenue, and partners to make sure that our ships go out on time and with the maximum impact.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Excel across teams. Enterprise capabilities cut across all of our product verticals, so you should be comfortable working with product managers across the company to prioritize systemic improvements that our enterprise customers need.</li>
	<li>Be customer obsessed. You will be responsible for directly engaging with customers and understanding how they use our products. You’ll bring these insights back to the team to build a great roadmap.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Be data driven. You should be comfortable working with data, and analyzing data to quantify the impact of problems and opportunities in your space.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
