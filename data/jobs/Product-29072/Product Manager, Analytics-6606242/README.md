<h4>About the Role</h4>
<p>Cloudflare runs one of the largest networks in the world, and the telemetry we gather from that network is broad in variety and deep in cardinality. We're looking for a Product Manager who can help build an Analytics experience that enables customers to achieve unparalleled visibility into their users, applications, and networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Analytics PM will be responsible for building a set of analytics, logging, and reporting features that allow Cloudflare customers to quickly and intuitively answer questions about their Cloudflare One deployments. You will partner closely with many stakeholders across Cloudflare One to understand their product’s unique needs and create a consistent data-driven throughline. You will own creating Cloudflare One’s visibility story transforming this into a differentiator within the rapidly developing SASE landscape. You'll work with engineering and design providing clear requirements to create outcome-based dashboard experience that provides an authoritative perspective on the data that matters while also being extensible to any question a customer may have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a member of a growing team of analytics and monitoring product managers your responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>

	<li>Evangelize the vision so that all stakeholders are aligned, have context and understand where we are going.</li>
	<li>Measure success. Own the measures used to define success for your product. Success measures must be defined at the inception of a product and tracked throughout its lifecycle. Make measures visible to all stakeholders and interpret them into actionable conclusions and new hypotheses.</li>
	<li>Manage the roadmap. Make tough tactical prioritization decisions while helping the company think long-term. Build trust with stakeholders by maintaining an understandable, accurate roadmap.</li>
	<li>Author use cases and prioritize requirements. Translate observations and customer feedback into a prioritized product backlog. Author use cases based on specific real-world product applications and extrapolate detailed product requirements for the scenarios.</li>
