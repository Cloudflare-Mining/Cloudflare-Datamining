<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>Cloudflare Registrar is a core part of the Cloudflare experience, offering customers a simple and&nbsp; secure way to register and manage their domains. Using Cloudflare, customers register and renew domains at-cost and do not pay any mark up fees.</p>
<p>As the product leader for Cloudflare Registrar, you will own the vision, strategy, and execution for this key service, directly contributing to Cloudflare's mission and growth. This is not a typical product manager role. Not only will you be responsible for the product strategy and vision, but also the overall success of the registrar business.</p>
<p>Problems you may face:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How can we deliver a best-in-class domain registration and management experience that seamlessly integrates with Cloudflare's broader suite of security, performance, and reliability services?</li>
	<li>How do we drive adoption and encourage domain transfers into Cloudflare, while also recognizing that registering a domain is often our customers’ first step in their Cloudflare journey?</li>
	<li>How do we strategically position Cloudflare Registrar in a competitive market, leveraging our unique strengths while ensuring sustainable growth?</li>
	<li>How can we streamline the complexities of domain transfers, renewals, and compliance across various TLDs and registry requirements?</li>
	<li>How do we effectively manage the operations and financial performance of the Registrar business, working closely with finance and registry partners?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As the Senior Product Manager for Registrar, you’ll partner closely with dedicated engineering, design, legal, compliance, finance, and go-to-market teams. You will own the Registrar business, collaborating extensively with Finance to ensure its financial health and strategic alignment. At the same time, you’ll be expected to contribute to a high-performance culture and citizenship at Cloudflare - sharing your knowledge and energy to accelerate the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Key Competencies</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for someone who is curious, customer-centered, can learn quickly, think creatively, and work cross-functionally. Key responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Business &amp; Product Vision and Strategy:</strong> Define and communicate the vision, strategic direction, and goals for Cloudflare Registrar.</li>
	<li><strong>Roadmap Prioritization:</strong> Develop and maintain a product roadmap that balances core registrar functionality, user experience improvements, new feature development, compliance requirements, integrations, and financial objectives.</li>
	<li><strong>Operation and Financial Oversight:</strong> Work closely with finance and registry partners to manage costs, forecasting, and reporting for the Registrar business.</li>
	<li><strong>Champion of the customer:</strong> Conduct qualitative user research through customer calls and surveys to understand the needs, workflows, and challenges of domain owners. Additionally, gather feedback internally from various channels and customer-facing teams to develop insights on customer challenges and new product requirements.</li>
	<li><strong>Cross-functional Partnership:</strong> Collaborate with engineering, product design, and context experience design to draft and review product requirement documents, design specs, and engineering specs. Partner extensively with Finance, Legal, Compliance, Marketing, Sales, Customer Support, and Business Intelligence to ensure successful product launches, user adoption, regulatory adherence, and financial success.</li>
	<li><strong>Data-informed Decisions:</strong> Create dashboards to analyze user behavior, registration/transfer/renewal funnels, experiment results, and key financial metrics (revenue, margin, costs). Collaborate with the business intelligence team to analyze backend metrics impacted by new features and business initiatives.</li>
	<li><strong>First-class Execution:</strong> Gets things done and has a track record of driving excellence, impact, and managing complex projects end-to-end.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Strong history of impact</li>
	<li>Experience managing a product line with P&amp;L responsibility and experience collaborating closely with finance teams&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Deep understanding of the domain name system (DNS), ICANN policies, registry operations, and the broader domain registration industry.</li>
	<li>Data-fluency - there is no team of analysts at Cloudflare. Can you work directly with data yourself to build confidence in your views and can you use that same data to persuade others?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Engineering fluency - while it’s not required, we tend to find success with candidates who have a technical background, formal or otherwise. You don’t need a CS degree but building credibility with our engineering teams is critical and so some history of technical acumen would be super helpful</li>
	<li>At Cloudflare it’s pretty helpful to understand how the Internet really works at layers 2 through 7. If you don’t have this, be prepared to speak with mastery about another realm of similar complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>
<p>Compensation may vary based on location and level. This role is eligible to participate in Cloudflare's equity (RSU) program.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>New York, Seattle, &amp; Washington D.C. estimated salary: $192,000 - $234,000 (Senior Level)</li>
	<li>Austin &amp; Colorado estimated salary: $170,000 - $208,000 (Senior Level)</li>
</ul>
