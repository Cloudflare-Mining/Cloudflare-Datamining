<h4><strong>About the Department</strong></h4>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you are responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare sit at the intersection of software development, design, and business strategy. We shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, create a launch plan with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation. We have ultimate responsibility for understanding our client needs, influencing business strategy, feature specification, and working with engineering to develop our software.</p>
<h4><strong>About the Role</strong></h4>
<p>Cloudflare provides a turnkey Bot Management solution that protects customers from unwanted automated traffic. As attackers have evolved, more sophisticated attacks that specifically target high value endpoints (like login, account creation, or checkout pages) involve humans working in conjunction with automation. We are hiring an experienced Product Manager both to help us launch a new product directly targeted at solving these fraud use cases, as well as helping lead a team or product managers working to improve our existing bot management offerings.</p>
<p>As Group Product Manager for Fraud, your job will be to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ensure customers are able to easily identify whether behavior is coming from valid users, or threat actors that have compromised user accounts.</li>
	<li>Build innovative solutions to customers’ application security problems that leverage the unique strengths of Cloudflare: a massive, highly interconnected network spanning the world, threat intelligence distilled from an unparalleled vantage point on the Internet, and a high-velocity engineering organization that ships early and often.</li>
	<li>Harness cutting edge machine learning (ML) techniques to build solutions that detect and mitigate application security threats with minimal customer involvement.</li>
	<li>Think through how to make a great, easy-to-use product that customers love, and drive the full product life cycle from core user needs discovery through to pricing and packaging. Ship continuous software and process improvements to support your products’ sustained growth.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></h4>
<p>As a member of the growing team of product managers your responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Own the product vision for your area. Ensure that it aligns with the overall product and company vision.</li>
	<li>Be an expert on the domain, the market, the trends. Evangelize the vision constantly so all stakeholders are aligned, have context and understand where we are going.</li>
	<li>Represent the customer. Be the champion and voice of customers. Build intimate, personal customer relationships. Bring the customer's voice into the creation process.</li>
	<li>Manage the roadmap. Make tough tactical prioritization decisions while helping the company think long-term. Build trust with stakeholders by maintaining an understandable, accurate roadmap.</li>
	<li>Author use cases and prioritize requirements. Translate market observations and customer feedback into a prioritized product backlog. Author use cases based on specific real-world product applications and extrapolate detailed product requirements for the scenarios.</li>
	<li>Collaborate across teams. We win or lose as a team. Product managers play a critical role in creating alignment between engineering teams and other stakeholders. A collaborative attitude is essential to the job.</li>
	<li>Measure success. Own the measures used to define success for your product. Success measures must be defined at the inception of a product and tracked throughout its lifecycle. Make measures visible to all stakeholders and interpret them into actionable conclusions and new hypotheses.</li>
	<li>Develop new opportunities. With your finger on the pulse of the market, the customers and the engineering teams, you are uniquely positioned to bring new products to market that solve real customer problems.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience</strong></h4>
<p>You are entrepreneurial-minded and thrive in a fast-paced and goal-driven environment. You have outstanding communication and collaboration skills and are able to work with a diverse group, get consensus, and drive the product forward. You are execution focused and emphasize getting things done while paying attention to important details. You have several years of experience working with enterprise, SaaS, or security technologies. You have a passion for building SaaS products and want to solve the problems of performance, security, and reliability of the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<li>Must be able to define and manage complex process and/or product issues of a broad scope using independent judgment.</li>
	<li>Experience balancing execution, agility, and culture at a fast growing business.</li>
	<li>Strong technical abilities. You are intimately familiar with modern software development practices used to build and deploy applications and data systems. You've preferably been working full time on a software delivery team.</li>
	<li>Deep customer and stakeholder empathy. You must be not only the voice of the customer, but at various times the voice of marketing, finance, engineering, support and ops. You must be able to channel many points of view.</li>
