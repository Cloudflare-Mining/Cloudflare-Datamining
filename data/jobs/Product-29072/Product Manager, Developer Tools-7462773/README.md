<p><strong>About Product Management at Cloudflare</strong></p>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you will be responsible for building products and workflows that help us improve the way the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, collaborate with other PMs, conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation.</p>
<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>As a Senior Product Manager for Developer Tools, your primary goal is to help improve the efficiency and happiness of Cloudflare’s internal engineering teams. You’ll work closely with a strong team of Engineers to build tools and processes that make developers' lives better.</p>
<p>You’ll be responsible for the long-term strategy, roadmap, and delivery of internal developer tools and platforms. You will give our developers the firepower they need to improve the 20% of the web that runs on Cloudflare products. This includes areas such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Developer productivity:</strong> Identifying and removing friction in the development workflow—from code commit to production deployment</li>
	<li><strong>Developer insights and SDLC:</strong> Metrics, dashboards, and tooling that help teams understand their own velocity, quality, and bottlenecks</li>
	<li><strong>Developer infrastructure:</strong> Build systems, CI/CD pipelines, source control workflows, and deployment automation</li>
	<li><strong>AI-assisted development:</strong> Enabling engineers with AI tooling—code generation, automated code review, intelligent debugging, and workflow automation</li>
	<li><strong>Cloudflare on Cloudflare:</strong> Championing the use of our own customer-facing developer platform for internal use, and improving those products through dogfooding</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Own the DevTools roadmap:</strong> Define priorities, make tradeoffs, and maintain a clear view of what we’re building and why.</li>
	<li><strong>Run discovery with engineering teams:</strong> Conduct regular research with internal developers to identify pain points, validate solutions, and measure adoption.</li>
	<li><strong>Define and track success metrics:</strong> Establish measurable outcomes for developer productivity initiatives—build times, deployment frequency, developer satisfaction, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Write PRDs and specs:</strong> Author clear product documentation that frames the problem, success criteria, and constraints—while leaving room for engineering to determine the best approach.</li>
	<li><strong>Partner with engineering leadership:</strong> Collaborate on quarterly planning, staffing allocation, and cross-team dependencies.</li>
	<li><strong>Communicate across the org:</strong> Keep stakeholders informed on progress, decisions, and upcoming changes. Evangelize new tools and drive adoption.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Competencies</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Problem-first thinking:</strong> You understand problems deeply before jumping to solutions. You bring the team along on the journey—sharing context, inviting input, and building shared understanding before arriving at a solution.</li>
	<li><strong>Outcomes orientation:</strong> You define success in terms of measurable impact, not activities or deliverables. You ask “How will we know it worked?” before building.</li>
	<li><strong>Cross-functional partnership:</strong> You collaborate effectively with engineering, design, and other product teams. You work well asynchronously and respect people’s time.</li>
	<li><strong>Data-informed decision making:</strong> You use data to inform product decisions and measure impact—but you know when data is insufficient and judgment is required.</li>
	<li><strong>Technical credibility:</strong> You can hold your own in conversations with engineers about architecture, tradeoffs, and implementation approaches.</li>
	<li><strong>AI fluency:</strong> You actively use AI tools in your own work and stay current on how AI is changing software development. You can separate signal from hype and focus on what actually improves developer outcomes.</li>
	<li><strong>Clear communication:</strong> You write and speak with precision. You prefer outcomes over activities, and direct feedback over hedging.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>An engineering background or experience building software yourself. This gives you credibility with engineering teams and helps you understand their world.</li>
	<li>Experience with developer productivity tools, build systems, or CI/CD pipelines—either as a PM or as a user.</li>
	<li>Comfort with ambiguity. Internal platform work often lacks the clear market signals of customer-facing products. You’ll need to define success criteria and prioritize without perfect information.</li>
	<li>Experience thoughtfully applying Generative AI to improve developer workflows—not just hype, but real impact on efficiency or quality.</li>
	<li>Familiarity with how the Internet works (layers 2–7). If not, be prepared to speak with depth about another domain of similar complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
