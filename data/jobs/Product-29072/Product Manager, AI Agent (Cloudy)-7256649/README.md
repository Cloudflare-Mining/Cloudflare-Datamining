<h2>About Product Management at Cloudflare</h2>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you are responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare sit at the intersection of software development, design, and business strategy. We shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, create a launch plan with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, or pair with an engineer on implementation. We have ultimate responsibility for understanding our client needs, influencing business strategy, feature specification, and working with engineering to develop our software.</p>
<h3>About the Role</h3>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you will be responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, collaborate with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation.</p>
<p>We are seeking an innovative and customer-centric Product Manager to own the vision, strategy, and execution of Cloudy, our conversational AI agent. In this role, you will be at the forefront of changing how customers and security teams interact with our platform, transforming complex tasks into simple, conversational workflows. You will lead the development of Cloudy as a core platform technology, focusing on enabling other teams to innovate and build upon it. You will work horizontally across the product organization to provide robust tools, APIs, and services that expand our ecosystem's value. As a foundational pillar of this work, you will also own the core application security use cases: designing agent interactions for services like WAF to both simplify security operations and demonstrate the platform's power.</p>
<p><strong>You will:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Own your space. You will own the priorities and scope for a high performing engineering team focusing on authentication.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Connect the pieces. Product managers are a nerve center at Cloudflare, responsible for connecting engineering, program management, marketing, revenue, and partners to make sure that our ships go out on time and with the maximum impact.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Excel across teams. Enterprise capabilities cut across all of our product verticals, so you should be comfortable working with product managers across the company to prioritize systemic improvements that our enterprise customers need.</li>
	<li>Be customer obsessed. You will be responsible for directly engaging with customers and understanding how they use our products. You’ll bring these insights back to the team to build a great roadmap.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Join pre-sales and post-sales calls with customers, sales, support, etc., to assist with, and help understand all phases of the customer lifecycle</li>
	<li>Be data driven. You should be comfortable working with data, and analyzing data to quantify the impact of problems and opportunities in your space.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key qualifications and skills</h3>
<ul>
	<li>4+ years of experience as a product manager, technical program manager, or equivalent delivering solutions in the cloud at scale for a technical audience&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Customer focus. At Cloudflare, we serve the needs of customers large and small, and our product managers need to be comfortable understanding how to design for enterprises without compromising the experience for individuals and small businesses.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Technical Acumen and Domain Knowledge: The ability to grasp complex technical concepts, particularly in the security, cloud infrastructure, or SaaS space. You must be comfortable engaging in deep technical discussions with engineering teams.</li>
	<li>Prompt Engineering and LLM Customisation: A practical, hands-on understanding of prompt engineering techniques or experience working with fine-tuning models for specific enterprise use cases. This demonstrates a deeper, more practical grasp of the underlying technology.</li>
	<li>Cross-Functional Leadership: Demonstrated ability to influence and align cross-functional teams (Engineering, Design, Marketing, other PMs) around a shared vision and roadmap without direct authority.</li>
	<li>Data-Driven: You ground your decisions in data and qualitative user feedback, with a relentless focus on solving real-world problems for security operators and platform administrators.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bonus points</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Experience with Generative AI Products: Proven experience managing and shipping products powered by AI, Machine Learning, or Natural Language Processing (NLP). Direct experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) and conversational interfaces is highly desirable.</li>
	<li>Understanding of Enterprise Software - the products, the buyers, the opportunities and challenges specific to providing solutions to some of the largest companies in the world.</li>
	<li>Platform and API-First Mindset: A strong understanding of platform dynamics, with experience defining requirements for APIs and services that serve multiple internal and external customers. You can think in terms of systems, not just features.</li>
	<li>Zero-to-One Product Experience: Experience taking a brand new product from the initial concept phase all the way to a successful launch (0 to 1), especially within a larger organization, shows they can navigate ambiguity and build momentum from scratch.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
