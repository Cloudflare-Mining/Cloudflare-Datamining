<p><strong>About the Department</strong></p>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you are responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare sit at the intersection of software development, design, and business strategy. We shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, create a launch plan with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation. We have ultimate responsibility for understanding our client needs, influencing business strategy, feature specification, and working with engineering to develop our software.</p>
<p><strong>About The Team</strong></p>
<p>Cloudflare’s Rules and Insights team helps customers migrate their configurations to the Cloudflare edge, and give those customers the tools they need to understand what happens to their web traffic at every step of the journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through widely adopted products like the Rules suite and Trace, the team create products, features and tools that allow customers to migrate existing workloads to Cloudflare, and run their operations solely on Cloudflare rather than using on premise software or competitors. Recent team successes include <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-snippets-alpha/">Snippets</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/traffic-transparency-unleashing-cloudflare-trace/">Trace</a>.</p>
