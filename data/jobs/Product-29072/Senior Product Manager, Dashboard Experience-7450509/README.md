<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>Cloudflare’s Dashboard plays a central role in helping Cloudflare reach $5 billion revenue in the next few years and to accelerate our mission of helping to build a better Internet. As the product manager leading the Cloudflare Dashboard, you will be a technical leader that pushes the boundaries of growth, prototyping, and customer experience in order to measure and grow the engagement of customers and prospects with our products and with Cloudflare itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problems you may face:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>What’s the best way to set up our customers for success and show them the magic of Cloudflare when there are dozens of jobs-to-be-done and use cases? How do we do that while elevating the craft and customer experience for everyone at the same time?</li>
	<li>How can the dashboard provide individual product teams at Cloudflare with a powerful canvas to deliver world-class experiences? Can we maintain a tech stack and common design language that empowers teams to build great experiences rather than constrain them?</li>
	<li>Can we simultaneously educate customers about our products, convince them to pay, then onboard and upsell them to new offerings, as well as encourage them to onboard their colleagues and friends?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Can we manage adjacent cost drivers like customer support and outbound sales? Can we be confident that moving the needle on these fronts is doing more good than harm?</li>
</ul>
<p>As the Senior Product Manager, Dashboard, you’ll partner with a committed set of engineering, design, and go-to-market teams as well as product teams from around the company to meet these challenges. At the same time, you’ll be expected to contribute to a high performance culture and citizenship at Cloudflare - sharing your knowledge and energy to accelerate the organization.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Key Competencies</strong></h4>
<p>We want to find someone who is curious, can learn quickly, think creatively, and work cross-functionally with engineering, design and other teams. A few key responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>First-class execution and impact: Gets things done and has a track-record of driving excellence and impact.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A/B experimentation and prototyping: High velocity tests and prototyping to maximize learnings. Comfortable with to prototype, ship, and measure progress continuously.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Product sense and strategy: Have world-class UX sense and a high bar for craft. Define and communicate the vision and strategic direction for the Cloudflare Dashboard, prioritizing investment in specific, high-leverage platform capabilities</li>
	<li>Roadmap prioritization: Develop and maintain a product roadmap that balances short-term dashboard improvements with projects that contribute to the long-term strategic vision</li>
	<li>Data-informed decisions: Run thoughtful experiments, create dashboards to analyze user behavior and experiment results, and collaborate with the business intelligence team to analyze backend metrics impacted by new dashboard features</li>
	<li>Voice of the customer: Conduct qualitative user research through customer calls and surveys to understand the needs, workflows, and challenges of different Cloudflare Dashboard users.

	<li>Data-fluency - there is no team of analysts at Cloudflare. Can you work directly with data yourself to build confidence in your views and can you use that same data to persuade others?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>At Cloudflare it’s pretty helpful to understand how the Internet really works at layers 2 through 7. If you don’t have this, be prepared to speak with mastery about another realm of similar complexity.</li>
