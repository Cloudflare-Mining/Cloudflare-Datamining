<h4>About the Role</h4>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you will be responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, collaborate with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation.</p>
<p>As a product manager on the Identity and Access Management team, you will be responsible for helping to build the capabilities that our largest customers demand that will help them effectively use Cloudflare’s connectivity cloud to secure their important apps and services. You will:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Own your space. You will own the priorities and scope for a high performing engineering team focusing focused on identity and access management.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Connect the pieces. Product managers are a nerve center at Cloudflare, responsible for connecting engineering, program management, marketing, revenue, and partners to make sure that our ships go out on time and with the maximum impact.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Excel across teams. Enterprise capabilities cut across all of our product verticals, so you should be comfortable working with product managers across the company to prioritize systemic improvements that our enterprise customers need.</li>
	<li>Be customer obsessed. You will be responsible for directly engaging with customers and understanding how they use our products. You’ll bring these insights back to the team to build a great roadmap.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Be data driven. You should be comfortable working with data, and analyzing data to quantify the impact of problems and opportunities in your space.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key qualifications</h4>
<ul>
	<li>4+ years of experience as a product manager, technical program manager, or equivalent delivering solutions in the cloud at scale for a technical audience&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Customer focus. At Cloudflare, we serve the needs of customers large and small, and our product managers need to be comfortable understanding how to design for enterprises without compromising the experience for individuals and small businesses.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>User experience sense. You’re comfortable working with product designers to translate the requirements into an elegant user experience.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Strong written and verbal communication skills for both an internal and external audience as appropriate.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bonus points</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Prior experience as a product manager for a team focused on identity and access management, authentication, authorization, role based access control (RBAC), or SaaS authentication systems like OAuth, or OIDC.</li>
	<li>Data-fluency - Can you work directly with data yourself to build confidence in your views and can you use that same data to persuade others?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Engineering fluency - while it’s not required, we tend to find success with candidates who have a technical background, formal or otherwise. You don’t need a CS degree but building credibility with our engineering teams is critical and so some history of technical acumen would be super helpful</li>
</ul>
<p>At Cloudflare it’s pretty helpful to understand how the Internet really works at layers 2 through 7. If you don’t have this, be prepared to speak with mastery about another realm of similar complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
