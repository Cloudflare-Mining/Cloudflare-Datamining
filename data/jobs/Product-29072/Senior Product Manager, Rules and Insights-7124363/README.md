<h2>About Product Management at Cloudflare</h2>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you are responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare sit at the intersection of software development, design, and business strategy. We shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, create a launch plan with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, or pair with an engineer on implementation. We have ultimate responsibility for understanding our client needs, influencing business strategy, feature specification, and working with engineering to develop our software.</p>
<h2>About the role</h2>
<p>As Product Manager for <strong>Rules &amp; Insights</strong>, you’ll help shape a key part of our core product experience. Our customers use Rules to configure the flow of information in and out of Cloudflare - every request to every site we manage flows through this rules engine (nearly 20% of the global internet every day).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this role, you’ll support the development and evolution of this product, helping define and communicate the product vision, gathering user feedback, and contributing to the roadmap. You’ll collaborate closely with engineers, designers, and security experts to deliver features that support customers of all different types, processing every request we see. Additionally, you will:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Own your space. You will own the priorities and scope for a high performing engineering team focused on Cloudflare’s Rules Product.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Connect the pieces. Product managers are a nerve center at Cloudflare, responsible for connecting engineering, program management, marketing, revenue, and partners to make sure that our ships go out on time and with the maximum impact.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Excel across teams. Enterprise capabilities cut across all of our product verticals, so you should be comfortable working with product managers across the company to prioritize systemic improvements that our enterprise customers need.</li>
	<li>Be customer obsessed. You will be responsible for directly engaging with customers and understanding how they use our products. You’ll bring these insights back to the team to build a great roadmap.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Be data driven. You should be comfortable working with data, and analyzing data to quantify the impact of problems and opportunities in your space.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>What you'll do</h2>
<p>In this role, you’ll contribute to shaping one of our core request processing products - <strong>Rules</strong> - a centralized hub that lets administrators create, test and deploy sophisticated logical conditions that apply to all inbound and outbound requests at global scale.</p>
<p>You’ll work closely with engineering, design, and cross-functional teams to deeply understand user needs, uncover friction points, and design intuitive, logical and powerful experiences that enable our users to manage the flow of information for the sites they manage with us. You’ll help define and track key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure user engagement, product adoption, and the long-term effectiveness of behavior-driven workflows.</p>
<h2>Key qualifications</h2>
<p>At Cloudflare, Product Managers are measured both on outcomes (“the what”) and how they accomplish results. Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5+ years of experience in product management, solutions engineering, or related roles</li>
	<li>Familiarity with designing or contributing to habit-forming product experiences</li>
	<li>Experience defining and tracking KPIs to measure product or user behavior impact</li>
	<li>Strong collaboration skills and experience working with engineering and design teams</li>
	<li>Comfort operating in fast-paced, evolving environments</li>
	<li>A passion for user empathy and delivering customer-centric solutions</li>
	<li>Excellent communication skills and attention to detail</li>
	<li>Curiosity and a strong desire to learn technical topics, especially in security or observability</li>
	<li>Engineering fluency - while it’s not required, we tend to find success with candidates who have a technical background, formal or otherwise. You don’t need a CS degree but building credibility with our engineering teams is critical and so some history of technical acumen is a key part of the role.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Bonus points</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Prior experience as a product manager for a team focused on building conditional/branching logic editor type products.</li>
	<li>Prior experience delivering cloud infrastructure products at global scale.</li>
	<li>Data fluency - Can you work directly with data yourself to build confidence in your views and can you use that same data to persuade others?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
