		<p>At Cloudflare, we are on a mission to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><strong>About the Role</strong></h4>
<p>Cloudflare’s Dashboard plays a central role in helping Cloudflare 5x its revenue in the next 5 years. As the product leader of the Cloudflare Dashboard, you will measure and grow the engagement of customers and prospects with our products and with Cloudflare itself.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Problems you may face:&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
	<li>How can the dashboard provide individual product teams at Cloudflare with a powerful canvas to deliver world-class experiences? Can we maintain a tech stack and common design language that empowers teams to build great experiences rather than constrain them?</li>
	<li>Can we simultaneously educate customers about our products, convince them to pay, then onboard and upsell them to new offerings, as well as encourage them to onboard their colleagues and friends?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Can we manage adjacent cost drivers like customer support and outbound sales? Can we be confident that moving the needle on these fronts is doing more good than harm?</li>
</ul>
<p>As the Product Manager, Dashboard, you’ll partner with a committed set of engineering, design, and go-to-market teams as well as product teams from around the company to meet these challenges. At the same time, you’ll be expected to contribute to a high performance culture and citizenship at Cloudflare - sharing your knowledge and energy to accelerate the organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key Competencies</strong></p>
<p>We want to find someone who is curious, can learn quickly, think creatively, and work cross-functionally with engineering, design and other teams. A few key responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Product vision and strategy: Define and communicate the vision and strategic direction for the Cloudflare Dashboard, prioritizing investment in specific, high-leverage platform capabilities</li>
	<li>Roadmap prioritization: Develop and maintain a product roadmap that balances short-term dashboard improvements with projects that contribute to the long-term strategic vision</li>
	<li>Data-informed decisions: Run thoughtful experiments, create dashboards to analyze user behavior and experiment results, and collaborate with the business intelligence team to analyze backend metrics impacted by new dashboard features</li>
	<li>First-class execution: Gets things done and has a track-record of driving excellence and impact</li>
	<li>Voice of the customer: Conduct qualitative user research through customer calls and surveys to understand the needs, workflows, and challenges of different Cloudflare Dashboard users. Additionally, gather feedback internally from various channels and customer-facing teams to develop insights on customer challenges and new product requirements</li>
	<li>Cross-functional partnership: Collaborate with engineering, product design, and context experience design to draft and review product requirement documents, design specs, and engineering specs. Also, partner with marketing, sales, customer support, business intelligence, and other cross-functional teams to ensure successful product launches, user adoption, and experiment analysis</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Bonus Points</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Understanding the modern UX stack with enough fidelity to hold your own with engineers will be highly beneficial. An engineering background would be helpful. An alternate source of credibility on this front might come from having developed a web property yourself.</li>
	<li>Data-fluency - there is no team of analysts at Cloudflare. Can you work directly with data yourself to build confidence in your views and can you use that same data to persuade others?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>At Cloudflare it’s pretty helpful to understand how the Internet really works at layers 2 through 7. If you don’t have this, be prepared to speak with mastery about another realm of similar complexity.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>
<p>Compensation may be adjusted depending on work location.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Colorado-based hires: Estimated annual salary of $140,000 - $172,000</span></p>
