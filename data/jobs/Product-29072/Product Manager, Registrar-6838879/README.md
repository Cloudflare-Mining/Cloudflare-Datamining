<p>Problems you may face:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How can we deliver a best-in-class domain registration and management experience that seamlessly integrates with Cloudflare's broader suite of security, performance, and reliability services?</li>
	<li>How do we drive adoption and encourage domain transfers into Cloudflare, while also recognizing that registering a domain is often our customers’ first step in their Cloudflare journey?</li>
	<li>How do we strategically position Cloudflare Registrar in a competitive market, leveraging our unique strengths while ensuring sustainable growth?</li>
	<li>How can we streamline the complexities of domain transfers, renewals, and compliance across various TLDs and registry requirements?</li>
	<li>How do we effectively manage the operations and financial performance of the Registrar business, working closely with finance and registry partners?</li>
