<p><strong>About the Department</strong></p>
<p>The Finance &amp; BizOps team provides the financial insights and strategic guidance to shape Cloudflare's growth, profitability, and investment strategy. We’re partners who embed across the business—connecting strategy to execution, driving planning and analysis, and collaborating with cross-functional leaders to develop and deliver key priorities. This team of passionate problem-solvers thrives in a fast-paced environment, designing and implementing high-quality, scalable solutions.</p>
<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for a highly strategic, analytical, and forward-looking leader to join our team as the Senior Director, Strategic Modeling &amp; Planning. This leader will drive modeling advancements while translating complex outputs into clear, actionable narratives for the executive team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be responsible for designing, owning, and governing the core logic, methodology, and forecast quality of our revenue model, and using this expertise to drive more insightful and impactful modeling techniques across the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a pivotal leadership role that will also directly own how we enhance our planning and forecasting capabilities and drive scalability with Anaplan.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What You'll Do</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Own the Corporate Revenue Engine:</strong> Own and elevate the end-to-end design, execution, and continuous improvement of our revenue forecast. You will lead our monthly, quarterly, and annual revenue planning processes, including variance analysis, scenario planning, and executive-level reporting for all topline metrics<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Lead Strategic &amp; Scenario Modeling: </strong>&nbsp;Build and maintain robust, multi-scenario models that connect operational KPIs to the financial forecast, enabling real-time scenario planning, delivering high-value insights, and supporting long-range planning, investment prioritization, and executive "what-if" analysis.</li>
	<li><strong>Lead the System &amp; Modeling Roadmap: </strong>Directly manage the Anaplan COE and own the long-term vision for our finance system. You are responsible for the COE's dual mandate: executing the build of a scalable, automated revenue model while also broadly enabling the entire finance organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Drive AI &amp; Transformation: </strong>Research, prototype, and champion the adoption and implementation of advanced analytics and AI tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Drive Executive-Level Storytelling: </strong>Translate complex and often incomplete financial data into a clear, actionable topline narrative. You will be responsible for creating and presenting insights for the executive leadership team, board, and earnings preparation.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Be a Talent Magnet &amp; Leader:</strong> Recruit, lead, and mentor a high-performing team, fostering a culture of excellence and innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br></strong><strong>Examples Of Desirable Skills, Knowledge And Experience:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>15+ years of progressive experience in a highly analytical, strategic capacity (e.g., Investment Banking, Private Equity, Top-Tier Consulting) or a similar corporate "builder" role, with deep experience in a high-growth, public company SaaS environment.</li>
	<li>Financial Modeling Expertise: You are a true master modeler. You must have extensive, from-scratch experience architecting complex, integrated, three-statement financial models for high-growth public companies.</li>
	<li>Systems-Thinker &amp; Architect: You think in terms of data pipelines, logic layers, and product roadmaps, not just spreadsheets. You must have deep experience with financial planning applications (Anaplan strongly preferred) and a strong grasp of data structures to effectively design and implement new, scalable systems.</li>
	<li>Proven Leader-of-Leaders: Demonstrated success in building and leading high-performance, highly-analytical teams.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>World-Class Executive Presence: You must be able to distill complex modeling architecture and simulation outputs into simple, consumable, and actionable takeaways for a C-suite and Board-level audience.</li>
	<li>Intellectually Curious &amp; Rigorous: You have a problem-solving orientation and can apply rigorous, first-principles logic to solve multi-faceted problems. You are not satisfied with easy or convenient answers.</li>
	<li>BA/BS in a quantitative field</li>
