	<li>Support the development of a strategy for automating control testing using Oracle’s reporting capabilities and advanced tools such as AI and data analytics.</li>
	<li>Maintain and update SOX documentation, including risk-control matrices (RCMs), narratives, and process flows in response to system and process changes.</li>
	<li>Coordinate walkthroughs, testing activities, and remediation plans in collaboration with internal stakeholders and external auditors.</li>
	<li>Track SOX program milestones, manage status reporting, and drive timely completion of testing and issue resolution.</li>
