	<div>
		<p>At Cloudflare, we are on a mission to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>About Cloudflare's Security Team</strong></p>
<p>Security is at the heart of Cloudflare’s mission to help build a better Internet. Anytime we push code, it automatically affects the millions of Internet properties (powering websites, remote teams, APIs, mobile apps, etc.) running on our global network. Cloudflare's network is one of the largest in the world, spanning over 330 cities in more than 125 countries, and operating within 50 milliseconds of 95% of the Internet-connected population.</p>
<p>Security Engineering spans across the <em>Cyber Defense &amp; Engineering</em> and <em>CloudforceOne Threat Intelligence &amp; Research</em> teams within the Security group under our Chief Security Officer. Security at Cloudflare ensures that this massive flow of traffic remains secure and resilient against evolving threats. While our core engineering teams build the software that handles traffic, our security engineers build the systems that protect it. Technologies we use to defend the Internet include Go, Rust, Python, and C/C++.</p>
