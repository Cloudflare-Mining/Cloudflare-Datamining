<p><strong>Available Location: Lisbon, Portugal<br><br></strong><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>Cloudflare is seeking an intern to support a key project focused on gathering intelligence across the team to enhance data and reporting capabilities. Working closely with our Operations Manager, the intern will engage with team members across EMEA and globally to identify reporting requirements that drive better results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project will follow a structured approach, beginning with a discovery phase where the intern will meet with stakeholders to gather insights on reporting needs and data requirements. This will be followed by analysis and categorisation, organising and prioritising the collected information into clear areas of focus. The next step involves validation, where findings will be reviewed with stakeholders to confirm accuracy and refine requirements. The intern will then collaborate with the analytics team to assess existing data sources and identify gaps. Finally, they will compile detailed recommendations for immediate action and develop a roadmap for future improvements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This internship offers an excellent opportunity to build analytical, stakeholder engagement, and problem-solving skills while gaining hands-on experience in data-driven decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
