Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare.

<p><strong>About The Role</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be responsible for driving, building and shipping some of the most critical services at Cloudflare, including <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/">Workers KV</a> (a globally distributed key-value store) and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/">Hyperdrive</a>, which turns regional databases into globally distributed ones.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Workers KV underpins a large number of critical-path customer applications and Cloudflare-internal applications, and is one of the highest traffic services we have today. A tremendous number of customers rely on KV to store and serve configuration, routing and authentication data for every client they serve.</li>
	<li><a href="https://hyperdrive-demo.pages.dev/">Hyperdrive</a> enables developers to connect to existing relational databases in any other cloud (or on-prem) from Cloudflare Workers without incurring the overhead of establishing new connections and by caching frequent reads close to the client so that hot queries can be returned in milliseconds, not hundreds.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll be responsible for growing all of these products, ensuring they are highly reliable, and engaging directly with developers from organizations of all sizes to understand how we can address their problems.</p>
<p><strong>The Team</strong></p>
<p>We announced Cloudflare Workers in 2017&nbsp; — since then it’s played a key role in Cloudflare’s strategy for entering the compute market. Until the launch of Workers, as Cloudflare was ramping up its capabilities in the performance and security spaces, it became clear that developers needed more ways to control the edge than rules engines could support.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Workers has grown from a simple functions-as-a-service option into a fully blown full-stack platform. With any application, however, in addition to serverless compute, you need to be able to manage state and connect to data you already have.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Drive the strategy, roadmap &amp; represent your products across the organization</li>
	<li>Lead projects from ideation through launch, and continuing through ongoing maintenance and support</li>
	<li>Develop and nurture relationships with engineering and coordinate closely to ensure successful delivery of product</li>
	<li>Partner with other departments such as Product Marketing, Marketing, Community &amp; developer advocacy, Sales, and Customer Support to drive adoption and gather feedback from customers and prospects</li>
	<li>Ruthlessly prioritize across a complex environment of diverse customers, stakeholders and objectives</li>
	<li>Represent the company externally as needed, including meetings with customers and prospects and analysis</li>
	<li>Delve into market research to drive new investments opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples Of Desirable Skills, Knowledge And Experience</strong></p>
<p>The ideal candidate is entrepreneurial-minded and thrives in a fast-paced and goal-driven environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have outstanding communication and collaboration skills and are able to work with a diverse group, get alignment, and drive the product forward. You are execution focused and emphasize getting things done while paying attention to important details.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Proven track record of shipping developer-facing products from ideation to launch</li>
	<li>Experience distilling complex topics into easily understood written documents for stakeholders across levels and functions.</li>
	<li>Developer focus — you’ll be working directly, and often be a part of the customers team in helping them get their initial implementation off the ground</li>
	<li>BS/MS in a technology field.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Professional product management experience (3-4 years)</li>
	<li>Strong technical abilities. You are intimately familiar with modern software development practices used to build and deploy applications. You are capable of wading into the details &amp; understanding engineering decisions’ impact on the product, but can also drive 30k foot view</li>
	<li>A desire to sweat the details and ship great developer experiences</li>
	<li>Experience using developer tools (such as source-control management tools, CLIs, etc)</li>
	<li>A love for talking to developers at organizations both large and small on a daily basis so that you can build and ship products that solve real problems.</li>
	<li>Scripting/programming experience (Javascript, Rust, Go, etc.) and/or experience with using Cloudflare Workers or other serverless runtimes are considered a significant bonus.</li>
