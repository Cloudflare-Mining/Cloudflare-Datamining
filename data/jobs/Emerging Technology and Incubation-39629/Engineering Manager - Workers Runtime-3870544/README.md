	<div>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><strong>About the Department</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging Technologies &amp; Incubation (ETI) is where new and bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a massively successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers. Cloudflare’s edge and network make it possible to solve problems at massive scale and efficiency which would be impossible for almost any other organization.</span></p>
<h4><strong>About The Team</strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">We announced Cloudflare Workers in 2017&nbsp; — since then it’s played a key role in Cloudflare’s strategy for entering the developer market. As Cloudflare was ramping up its capabilities in the performance and security spaces, it became clear that developers needed more ways to control the edge than the rules engines could support. The Cloudflare Workers platform has empowered developers to add programmability to the edge— through code.&nbsp;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, the Workers platform has grown from a simple functions-as-a-service option into a full-blown full-stack platform, with storage options like Workers KV, Durable Objects and R2. The Workers platform also includes a rich suite of tools to support it: the wrangler CLI, the edge development environment (wrangler dev), and observability tools. On top of the foundational compute and storage building blocks, Cloudflare has built out best-in-class developer experience products with specific use cases in mind. Cloudflare Pages is wholly built on top of the foundational building blocks for seamless, opinionated web development with the Cloudflare portfolio.&nbsp;</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are truly just getting started. Our opportunity is both huge and unique. With the combination of owning the hardware and investing heavily in developer experience, we’re positioned as the next big evolution of cloud computing.&nbsp;</span></h4>
<h4><strong>What you’ll do</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for an Engineering Manager to join our team. You will lead a team of passionate, talented engineers that are building innovative products that bring security and speed to millions of internet users each day. You will play an active part in shaping product strategy based on what’s technically possible. You will make sure our company hits our ambitious goals from an engineering standpoint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You bring a passion for meeting business needs with building technically innovative solutions, and excel at shifting between the two—understanding how big-picture goals inform technical details, and vice-versa.

Most importantly, you will have a track record of having past teams respect you as both a technical leader and manager.</span></p>
