	<div>
		<p>At Cloudflare, we are on a mission to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>About the department</strong></p>
<p>Emerging Technology and Incubation (ETI) helps shape the future of the Internet. Cloudflare secures, accelerates, and powers millions of destinations on the Internet from small blogs to 35% of the Fortune 500. ETI is responsible for shipping the technologies we think those customers, and the rest of the Internet, will need over the next decade.</p>
<p>We created ETI years ago as a small, autonomous team that could equip Cloudflare to break into new markets and industries as the Internet evolves. The team is not just a home for science experiments. ETI takes new research and applies it to build something people want - or will want in the future. Ultimately, the success of the team is measured by its ability to both create new revenue streams for the company and to help Cloudflare secure and connect an increasing percentage of the Internet.</p>
<p>The team operates independently from Cloudflare’s core Product and Engineering team (though those partner teams are “Customer Zero” for anything that we build inside of ETI). The group relies on separate processes, structure, and timelines that allow it to move with greater flexibility.</p>
<p>ETI consists primarily of engineers and some Product Managers working alongside a handful of designers. The Product Managers in ETI are the first “go-to-market” advocates for what is built inside of ETI until those solutions mature to a point that the Cloudflare revenue team is ready to sell them widely.</p>
<p>The mission of ETI is to help prepare Cloudflare for the future, but that broad objective leaves plenty of room for flexibility and ambition. The scope of problems tackled by ETI range from shipping free tools that help build a better Internet, like our 1.1.1.1 resolver, to launching the foundations of products trusted by some of the world’s largest organizations like our Zero Trust suite. ETI’s leaders and team members must be ready to adapt accordingly.</p>
<p>New products that started inside of ETI include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/">industry-leading Developer Platform</a> products like our serverless compute solution, our storage offering, and our AI inference and services layer.</li>
	<li>Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/">best-in-class Zero Trust product line</a>, including our Zero Trust Access product, our Secure Web Gateway, our private networking technology, our data loss prevention suite, and our mobile and desktop clients.</li>
	<li>Cloudflare’s privacy solutions, like our <a href="https://one.one.one.one/">1.1.1.1 DNS resolver</a>, our consumer VPN product <a href="https://one.one.one.one/">WARP</a>, and the technologies we build with <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/icloud-private-relay/">partners like Apple</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/key-transparency/">Meta</a> to preserve privacy on the Internet.</li>
	<li>Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/media-and-entertainment/">Media products</a>, including our video streaming platform and real-time calls solution.</li>
	<li>Building blocks that change the economics of traditional costs on the Internet like our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/">domain registrar</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all products built inside of ETI go on to become core Cloudflare offerings. That is by design. We task ETI with taking “shots on goal” - running many small experiments, rapidly, to determine what works and what does not.</p>
<p>We believe that ETI is a critical component to our competitive edge as a business. Innovation happens in every department at Cloudflare, but it is the job of the ETI team to relentlessly push all of us forward so that existing and new customers continue to bet on us. The success of ETI is a leading indicator for the success of Cloudflare as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>About the role</strong></p>
<p>You will lead ETI at Cloudflare. You will be responsible for shipping the products and technologies we expect customers will need tomorrow. You will own the roadmap, the execution, and the initial customer traction for the next generation of Cloudflare solutions.</p>
<p>You will be a player coach alongside some of the best engineers and product people in the industry. The success of ETI relies on its people and you will also be expected to recruit and retain great talent.</p>
<p>In this role, you will also be a trusted resource to other executives. Leaders in other functions at the company will rely on your technical judgment as we evaluate the right decisions to make and places to focus.</p>
<p>Beyond just ETI, you will be a champion for Cloudflare as a whole to the industry. Many of the first customers to adopt new products built in ETI are existing customers who rely on Cloudflare’s core existing product set. You should build relationships with those customers and help them find value from their existing deployments so that you can earn their trust to try new services from ETI.</p>

	<li>Be the first champion and seller of new products built inside of ETI to internal and external customers. Be customer support when needed.</li>
	<li>Help your team and Cloudflare as a whole distinguish between what is a “good” idea and what is a “great” idea when we decide how to allocate the bets that Cloudflare makes for the next decade and beyond.</li>
	<li>Be hands on to help Product leaders prioritize the right problems and to help Engineering leaders make the right decisions so that they can move fast. Be available to help debug customer problems, internal errors, or broken user flows.</li>
	<li>Edit what is being built. Help teams inside of ETI focus, remove the non-essential, define the right scope to move quickly.</li>
	<li>Do your best to predict the future. Follow industries on the Internet as they evolve or appear. Connect with other leaders on the Internet who are also helping shape what its future looks like. Be an early adopter of new technologies as we evaluate what those mean for Cloudflare.</li>
	<li>Hunt down and remove the blockers that get in the way of shipping great software.</li>
	<li>Give structure to products as they evolve from ideas to prototypes to mainline Cloudflare solutions. Equip your teams to navigate pricing, packaging, marketing and the customer success of new products as they mature inside of ETI and eventually graduate into our core Product and Engineering organization.</li>
	<li>Embrace the ambiguity of the unknown. Don’t wait to be told what to build. Seek out and explore the areas where you think we should move.</li>
