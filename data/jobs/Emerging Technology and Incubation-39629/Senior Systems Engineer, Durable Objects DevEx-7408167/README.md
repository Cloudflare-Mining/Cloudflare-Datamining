<h3><strong>Available Location: Austin, Lisbon, London</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Role Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Cloudflare is building the future of the Internet, and the Workers platform is at the forefront of that mission. We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join the team behind <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/">Durable Object</a>, our globally-distributed, strongly-consistent coordination and state primitive, focusing on the Developer Experience. You will be responsible for the entire developer journey, from their first line of code to their production deployment and debugging. You’ll work with the Workers engineering and product teams to build the APIs, Javscript SDKs, and observability features that make building stateful applications on the edge intuitive, reliable, and maybe even a little bit fun. We’re looking for a pragmatic, product-minded engineer who is obsessed with developer ergonomics and has felt the pain of deploying complex applications in the cloud.</p>
<h3><strong>Role Responsibilities</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Design, build, and maintain the primary developer-facing surfaces for Durable Objects, including our command-line tooling (wrangler), APIs, SDKs, and dashboard.</li>
	<li>Own the end-to-end developer workflow, from creating intuitive local testing and simulation environments to building powerful debugging and observability tools for a globally distributed system.</li>
	<li>Act as a technical leader and mentor on the team, driving engineering quality through rigorous code and design reviews.</li>
	<li>Innovate on solutions to the unique challenges of managing and migrating state at the edge, ensuring developers can deploy with confidence.</li>
	<li>Collaborate closely with product managers, developer advocates, and support engineers to translate developer feedback into a concrete product roadmap.</li>
	<li>Author high-quality technical documentation, tutorials, and example applications that inspire developers and accelerate their time-to-production.</li>
	<li>Triage, investigate, and resolve complex bugs and performance issues reported by the large and growing community of developers building on Durable Objects.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Role Requirements</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Must-Have Skills</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>5+ years of professional software engineering experience, with a significant portion dedicated to building developer-facing tools, APIs, or cloud infrastructure.</li>
	<li>Deep, hands-on experience building, deploying, and operating applications on at least one major cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, or Cloudflare Workers).</li>
	<li>Strong proficiency in TypeScript/JavaScript and an interest in C++/Rust.</li>
	<li>A "product-first" mindset and a strong sense of empathy for developers; you get annoyed when tools are hard to use, and you're driven to fix them.</li>
	<li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to articulate complex distributed systems concepts to a wide range of audiences.</li>
	<li>A proven track record of taking ownership of complex projects and delivering them from inception to production in a distributed, asynchronous team environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Nice-to-Have Skills</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Direct experience building applications with Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects (we’d love to see what you’ve built!).</li>
	<li>Experience with distributed systems concepts, particularly actor-based models (like Erlang/OTP or Akka), consensus algorithms, or distributed databases.</li>
	<li>Active contributions to open-source developer tools or libraries.</li>
</ul>
