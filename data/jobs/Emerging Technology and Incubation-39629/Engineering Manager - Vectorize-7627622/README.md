<h3><strong>About the Team</strong></h3>
<p>The Cloudflare Vectorize team builds our managed, global vector database designed to power the next generation of AI-driven applications. Vectorize enables developers to store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings, providing the "long-term memory" required for Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic search. Integrated directly into the Cloudflare Workers and Workers AI ecosystem, Vectorize allows developers to build full-stack AI applications—from generating embeddings to performing similarity searches—entirely on Cloudflare’s global network.</p>
<p>Vectorize is a critical component of our Developer Platform and features:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>High-Performance Vector Search:</strong> Optimized for low-latency similarity search using Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms (like HNSW).</li>
	<li><strong>Metadata Filtering:</strong> Support for storing and filtering on metadata alongside vectors to provide precise, context-aware query results.</li>
	<li><strong>Global Distribution:</strong> Built on top of Cloudflare’s distributed infrastructure to ensure that AI applications remain fast and responsive regardless of where the user is located.</li>
</ul>
<p>The team is geographically located in the UK.</p>
<h3><strong>What you'll do</strong></h3>
<p>We are looking for an Engineering Manager to join the Vectorize team. You will lead a group of engineers who are defining how stateful AI applications are built at the edge. You will play a pivotal role in scaling Vectorize to support billions of vectors and hundreds of thousands of indexes while maintaining the performance and reliability Cloudflare is known for.</p>
<p>You will work closely with product and engineering teams to implement cutting-edge indexing strategies and improve the developer experience for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) workflows. You bring a passion for making complex AI infrastructure accessible to every developer. You thrive in a fast-paced environment where you are building the foundations of the AI era. Most importantly, you have a track record of leading technical teams with a focus on high-quality execution and engineer career development.</p>
<h3><strong>Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Strong communication skills</strong> – Ability to build a shared understanding of complex topics like vector quantization, indexing trade-offs, and distributed state.</li>
	<li><strong>Leading Distributed Systems</strong> – Experience leading and hiring teams that build and operate high-availability distributed databases or search engines.</li>
	<li><strong>Navigating the AI Landscape</strong> – Comfort working in the rapidly evolving world of AI/ML, understanding how vector databases fit into the broader LLM and RAG ecosystem.</li>
	<li><strong>Execution &amp; Predictability</strong> – Excel at planning, roadmap execution, and managing the lifecycle of a high-growth developer product.</li>
	<li><strong>Developer-First Mindset</strong> – Experience building APIs and tools that simplify complex backend operations for frontend and full-stack developers.</li>
	<li><strong>Technical Leadership</strong> – A track record of leading teams through hiring, onboarding, and mentorship. You can explain the "why" behind architectural decisions to both engineers and stakeholders.</li>
	<li><strong>Systems Programming</strong> – Professional experience with <strong>Rust, Go, or TypeScript</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bonus Points</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Search &amp; Indexing Expertise</strong> – Experience with vector search libraries (e.g., Faiss, HNSWlib) or traditional search engines (e.g., Elasticsearch, Lucene).</li>
			<li><strong>AI/ML Infrastructure</strong> – Experience building or managing platforms that serve machine learning models or manage embeddings at scale.</li>
			<li><strong>Database Internals</strong> – Familiarity with storage engines, query optimization, or distributed consistency models.</li>
			<li><strong>Serverless Ecosystem</strong> – Experience working with Cloudflare Workers or other serverless platforms to build stateful applications.</li>
		</ul>
