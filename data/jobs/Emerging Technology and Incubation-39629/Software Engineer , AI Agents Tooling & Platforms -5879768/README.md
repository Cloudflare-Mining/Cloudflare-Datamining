Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About the Department</strong><strong><br></strong>Emerging Technologies &amp; Incubation (ETI) is where new and bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a hugely successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers. Cloudflare’s edge and network make it possible to solve problems at massive scale and efficiency which would be impossible for almost any other organization.</p>
<p><strong>About the Team</strong><strong><br></strong>We’re building the foundational tooling and platform capabilities that power the next generation of AI agents on the Cloudflare Developer Platform. Our goal is to make it easier for AI agents to communicate, interact with the web, and work together - all while maintaining performance, scalability, and security.</p>
<p>Our team is leading efforts to ship core platform primitives for AI agent orchestration, including the Cloudflare Browser Rendering API, which enables efficient, headless browsing for agents. We're also focused on AI auditability and traceability for site owners, along with creating frameworks for seamless Agent-to-Agent interactions. Working closely with other Cloudflare platform teams, we’re shaping the future of how software engineers build, deploy, and manage intelligent agents at scale.</p>
<p>We are a tight-knit team that communicates and collaborates regularly. We celebrate our achievements, support one another through challenges, and hold both our work and each other to the highest standard.</p>
<p><strong>What you'll do</strong><strong><br></strong>In this role, you will join world-class engineers in shaping new products built entirely on Cloudflare’s global network, while continuing to nurture the growing impact of existing offerings—ensuring continual reliability, best-in-class performance, and the implementation of new features and functionality.</p>
<p>You will be encouraged to bring your ideas forward and own your code from inception to release, delivering solutions at every layer of the software stack to empower Cloudflare customers. On any given day, you might:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Write a design document outlining your strategy to tackle a specific challenge.</li>
	<li>Ship a new feature that integrates multiple technologies.</li>
	<li>Architect and deliver innovative API primitives for our AI agent platforms, including enhancements to the Cloudflare Browser Rendering API.</li>
	<li>Fix a bug affecting how our user experience renders.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can expect to work with a variety of languages and technologies including, but not limited to, TypeScript, Go, and Rust. We use Cloudflare Workers heavily and creatively. If applicable to ongoing projects, you will also help maintain the health and availability of services by participating in an on-call rotation.</p>
<p><strong>About you</strong><strong><br></strong> We want you to love it here! This role is a great fit for you if:</p>

	<li>You are excited to collaborate and communicate with engineers across Cloudflare, contributing to many layers of the stack.</li>
	<li>You take pride in shipping effective, reliable code.</li>
	<li>You are energized by learning new skills, tackling challenging debugging sessions, and sharing your knowledge with others.</li>
	<li>You believe that thorough documentation is just as important as delivering code.</li>
	<li>You want to join a team that upholds a culture of support, open and honest communication, and collaborative problem-solving.</li>
	<li>You are keen to explore emerging AI technologies and are excited by the opportunity to integrate AI agent platform primitives into our product suite.</li>
