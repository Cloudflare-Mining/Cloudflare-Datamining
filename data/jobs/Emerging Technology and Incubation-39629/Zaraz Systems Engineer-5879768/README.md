As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About the Department</strong></p>
<p>Emerging Technologies &amp; Incubation (ETI) is where new and bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a massively successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers. Cloudflare’s edge and network make it possible to solve problems at massive scale and efficiency which would be impossible for almost any other organization.</p>
<p><strong>About the Team</strong></p>
<p>Cloudflare Zaraz allows engineers and product teams to fuel the growth of their web applications using 3rd party tools while maintaining high performance metrics, minimizing security risks, and respecting privacy obligations. In doing so, the team helped establish the open source Managed Components initiative as a new Internet standard to improve how third party code is packaged for inclusion in digital products across a range of devices.</p>
<p>Building on its successful adoption so far, we’re looking to expand the Cloudflare Zaraz category &amp; catalog with a fresh complement of growth tools to continue removing obstacles in the path to develop thriving Internet properties.</p>
<p>We are a tight-knit team, communicating &amp; collaborating regularly. We like to celebrate our achievements, support each other when we make mistakes, and hold each other and our work to the highest standard.</p>
<p><strong>What you'll do</strong></p>
<p>In this role, you will join world class engineers in shaping new products built entirely on Cloudflare’s global network, while continuing to nurture the growing impact of Cloudflare Zaraz on the Internet - ensuring continual reliability, maintaining best-in-class performance, and implementing new features and functionality.</p>
<p>You will be encouraged to bring ideas and own your code from inception to release, delivering solutions at all layers of the software stack to empower Cloudflare customers. On any given day, you might write a design document that outlines how you plan to solve a specific problem, ship a new feature layered upon 3 different technologies, or fix a bug in how our user experience renders. You can expect to interact with a variety of languages and technologies including, but not limited to Typescript, Go, Rust. We use Workers heavily and creatively.</p>
