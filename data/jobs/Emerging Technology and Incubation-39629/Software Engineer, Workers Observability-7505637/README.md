<p><strong>Role Summary</strong></p>
<p>Workers Observability (WOBS) Team provides a growing suite of tools to monitor, troubleshoot and optimize applications on the Cloudflare Developer platform. These tools increasingly work across Cloudflare products to provide complete visibility into user applications. We aim to make these tools not only best-in-class but also frictionless and intuitive to use. All this within the context of Cloudflare's scale and globally distributed infrastructure.</p>
<p>Team members help design and ship core software features across the observability stack - including the frontend customer experience, integrations with other Cloudflare primitives, and our internal data stores and ingestion pipelines. You will own code across the development lifecycle from design to release including QA, incident management, and performance optimization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Systems Engineer role is a full-stack position which requires extensive cross-functional collaboration. On a given day you might incorporate frontend feedback from a customer, run a Clickhouse query to diagnose a data ingestion bug, and propose a better tracing integration with another product on the Workers platform.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Customer Focus:</strong> Be responsive to customer escalations, bug reports, and product feedback, and participate in pager duty for our production systems.</li>
	<li><strong>Software Development:</strong> Efficiently and reliably deliver high-quality software that meets the performance requirements of Cloudflare’s systems.</li>
	<li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> Address complex and subtle issues on our platform, which may require debugging across multiple systems, languages, and datastores.</li>
	<li><strong>Communication:</strong> Maintain clear written communication across a range of platforms as part of a globally distributed team (from US West Coast to UK) and across a range of different engineering and support teams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expertise: Success in this role will depend on becoming an expert not just on the observability platform, but on the Cloudflare Developer Platform as a whole.&nbsp;<br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Role Requirements (Must-Have Skills)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Must-Have Skills</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Strong proficiency in at least one programming language, preferably a typed language (e.g. Go, TypeScript, Rust) as well as SQL</li>
	<li>Experience building high-volume distributed systems using cloud primitives (AWS, GCP, CF), including queues, key-value stores, relational databases, blob storage, and serverless compute</li>
	<li>Experience troubleshooting distributed data systems including working with logs and data stores.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nice-to-Have Skills</strong></p>
<p>The following are nice-to-haves:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Working with lower level languages like Rust or C++</li>
	<li>Building frontend application in Typescript and React</li>
	<li>Building applications on the Cloudflare platform</li>
