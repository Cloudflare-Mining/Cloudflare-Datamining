<p><strong>About the department</strong></p>
<p>The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Cloudflare is responsible for setting technical direction, leading innovation, and shipping great technology. The CTO’s team at Cloudflare includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Emerging Technology and Incubation</strong>: Cloudflare’s department focused on shipping new products, built on our network, that place many small bets on the future of our industry.</li>
	<li><strong>Developer Platform</strong>: Cloudflare’s compute, storage, media, and AI layer where millions of developers build their applications.</li>

	<li><strong>Cloudflare Privacy</strong>: the products built at Cloudflare that help make the Internet more private for all of its users.</li>
</ul>
<p>The team operates independently from Cloudflare’s core Product and Engineering team (though those partner teams are “Customer Zero” for anything built inside of the CTO’s organization). The CTO’s team consists primarily of engineers, researchers, and Product Managers.</p>
<p>The scope of problems tackled by the CTO range from investigating frontier technologies, like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/">post-quantum cryptography</a>, to shipping free tools that help build a better Internet, like our 1.1.1.1 resolver, to launching the foundations of products trusted by some of the world’s largest organizations like our Zero Trust suite.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/">industry-leading Developer Platform</a> products like our serverless compute solution, our storage offering, and our AI inference and services layer.</li>
	<li>Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/">best-in-class Zero Trust product line</a>, including our Zero Trust Access product, our Secure Web Gateway, our private networking technology, our data loss prevention suite, and our mobile and desktop clients.</li>
	<li>Cloudflare’s privacy solutions, like our <a href="https://one.one.one.one/">1.1.1.1 DNS resolver</a>, our consumer VPN product <a href="https://one.one.one.one/">WARP</a>, and the technologies we build with <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/icloud-private-relay/">partners like Apple</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/key-transparency/">Meta</a> to preserve privacy on the Internet.</li>
	<li>Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/media-and-entertainment/">Media products</a>, including our video streaming platform and real-time calls solution.</li>
	<li>Building blocks that change the economics of traditional costs on the Internet like our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/">domain registrar</a>.</li>

Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.</span></p>
	<p><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"><strong>1.1.1.1</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We released</span><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1.1.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver.
