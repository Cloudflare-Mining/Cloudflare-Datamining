<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>About the Department</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Media Platform is part of Emerging Technologies &amp; Incubation (ETI), where new and bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a massively successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers. Cloudflare’s edge and network make it possible to solve problems at massive scale and efficiency which would be impossible for almost any other organization.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>About the Team</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Cloudflare Data Platform team is building a complete, serverless solution for ingesting, storing, and querying analytical data at a petabyte scale. We are moving toward an aggressive General Availability (GA) date in Summer 2026, and we are looking for a frontend expert to define how users interact with their data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our platform consists of three core pillars:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Cloudflare Pipelines:</strong> Receives events via Workers or HTTP, transforms them with SQL, and ingests them into Iceberg or R2.</span></li>
	<li style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>R2 Data Catalog:</strong> Manages Iceberg metadata and performs automated maintenance and compaction to ensure peak query performance.</span></li>
	<li style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>R2 SQL:</strong> Our in-house distributed SQL engine, designed to perform petabyte-scale queries over data stored in R2.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>About the role</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As a Senior Frontend Engineer for the Data Platform, you will have a massive scope to shape the UI/UX across our entire ecosystem. This isn't just about building dashboards; it’s about creating a seamless developer experience across the Cloudflare Dashboard, the Wrangler CLI, Terraform, and Python notebooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You will be the primary owner of the visual and interactive surface area for our data products, ensuring that complex analytical workflows feel intuitive, fast, and powerful.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>What you’ll do day-to-day:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
	<li style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Own the end-to-end user experience within the Cloudflare Dashboard for Pipelines, R2 Data Catalog, and our custom R2 SQL editor.</span></li>

	<li style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Build Workers Bindings for R2 Data Catalog and R2 SQL, making it effortless for developers to query their data directly from the edge.</span></li>
	<li style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Work closely with our distributed systems engineers to bridge the gap between our high-performance SQL engine and the end-user interface.</span></li>

	<li style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">While you are a frontend specialist, you have a solid understanding of SQL and the data lifecycle (ingestion, storage, and querying).</span></li>
