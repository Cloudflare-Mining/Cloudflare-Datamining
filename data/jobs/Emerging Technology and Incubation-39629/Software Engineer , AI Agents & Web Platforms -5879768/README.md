		<p>At Cloudflare, we are on a mission to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies.

Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;</p>

We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare.

<p><strong>About the Department</strong><strong><br></strong> Emerging Technologies &amp; Incubation (ETI) is where new and bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a hugely successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers. Cloudflare’s edge and network make it possible to solve problems at massive scale and efficiency which would be impossible for almost any other organization.</p>
<p><strong>About the Team</strong><strong><br></strong> Our team is focused on helping developers fuel the data-driven growth of their Internet properties while respecting privacy. We build on top of the Cloudflare development platform, pushing its limits to deliver tooling that ranges from open source contributions to high-impact, Enterprise-grade product solutions for massive-traffic volumes and bespoke customer requirements.</p>
<p>Originally starting with Cloudflare Zaraz—to enable engineers and product teams to integrate 3rd party tooling while maintaining high performance and minimizing security risks—our remit has since expanded. We now manage CDNJS, drive the open source Managed Components initiative, and lead a variety of special projects. Most notably, our team is now responsible for shipping cutting-edge AI agent platform primitives, including the Cloudflare Browser Rendering API, which is designed to deliver seamless, efficient rendering and interaction for AI-driven applications.</p>
<p>We are a tight-knit team that communicates and collaborates regularly. We celebrate our achievements, support one another through challenges, and hold both our work and each other to the highest standard.</p>
<p><strong>What you'll do</strong><strong><br></strong> In this role, you will join world-class engineers in shaping new products built entirely on Cloudflare’s global network, while continuing to nurture the growing impact of existing offerings—ensuring continual reliability, best-in-class performance, and the implementation of new features and functionality.</p>
<p>You will be encouraged to bring your ideas forward and own your code from inception to release, delivering solutions at every layer of the software stack to empower Cloudflare customers. On any given day, you might:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Write a design document outlining your strategy to tackle a specific challenge.</li>
	<li>Ship a new feature that integrates multiple technologies.</li>
	<li>Architect and deliver innovative API primitives for our AI agent platforms, including enhancements to the Cloudflare Browser Rendering API.</li>
	<li>Fix a bug affecting how our user experience renders.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can expect to work with a variety of languages and technologies including, but not limited to, TypeScript, Go, and Rust. We use Cloudflare Workers heavily and creatively. If applicable to ongoing projects, you will also help maintain the health and availability of services by participating in an on-call rotation.</p>
<p><strong>About you</strong><strong><br></strong> We want you to love it here! This role is a great fit for you if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You have a passion for meeting business needs while building technically innovative solutions, and you excel at balancing big-picture goals with technical detail.</li>
	<li>You are bold and persistent in your efforts to get your work across the finish line.</li>
	<li>You are excited to collaborate and communicate with engineers across Cloudflare, contributing at many layers of the stack.</li>
	<li>You take pride in shipping effective, reliable code.</li>
	<li>You are energized by learning new skills, tackling challenging debugging sessions, and sharing your knowledge with others.</li>
	<li>You believe that thorough documentation is just as important as delivering code.</li>
	<li>You want to join a team that upholds a culture of support, open and honest communication, and collaborative problem-solving.</li>
	<li>You are keen to explore emerging AI technologies and are excited by the opportunity to integrate AI agent platform primitives into our product suite.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>5+ years of experience working with high-volume software applications, with a strong focus on the TypeScript programming language.</li>
	<li>Ability to scope, work on, and independently deliver initiatives.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of at least one modern, strongly-typed programming language such as Go, Rust, or C++.</li>
	<li>Strong written communication skills for contributing to both internal and public-facing technical documentation, as well as authoring blog posts.</li>
