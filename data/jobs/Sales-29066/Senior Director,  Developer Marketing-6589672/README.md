	<li><strong>Build and manage a high-performing team</strong> of developer marketers, demand generation experts, and field marketers.</li>
	<li><strong>Refine our messaging and positioning</strong> to better communicate Cloudflare’s value to developers across different segments (from individual devs to enterprise engineering teams).</li>
	<li><strong>Develop a high-impact content strategy</strong>, ensuring our blog, documentation, and community resources align with developer needs and discovery patterns.</li>
	<li><strong>Drive end-to-end go-to-market (GTM) strategy</strong> for new developer-focused products, features, and launches.</li>
	<li><strong>Collaborate with Product, Engineering, and Sales</strong> to ensure developer marketing efforts align with company priorities and revenue goals.</li>
	<li><strong>Own the multi-year narrative</strong> with technology analysts, positioning Cloudflare as a leader in edge computing and modern cloud infrastructure.</li>
	<li><strong>Measure and optimize performance</strong> across all developer marketing efforts using data and experimentation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We’re Looking For</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Proven leadership experience</strong> in <strong>developer marketing, growth marketing, or demand generation</strong> for a <strong>developer-focused product</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Strong team leadership skills</strong>—experience hiring, managing, and scaling high-performing teams.</li>
	<li><strong>Deep understanding of developers</strong>—how they discover, evaluate, and adopt new technologies.</li>
	<li><strong>Track record of executing full-funnel marketing strategies</strong>—from awareness to engagement to revenue impact.</li>
	<li><strong>Experience driving measurable impact</strong> through campaigns, community engagement, and product-led growth.</li>
	<li><strong>Technical fluency</strong>—you understand modern software development practices and can speak credibly with engineers.</li>
	<li><strong>Excellent storytelling and positioning skills</strong>, with the ability to refine messaging for different developer segments.</li>
</ul>
