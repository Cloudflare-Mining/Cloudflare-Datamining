<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>Cloudflare is seeking an experienced, strategic, and technically savvy Public Relations Director to own the communications landscape for our developer ecosystem and the game-changing Workers platform.&nbsp;This isn't your standard PR gig. You won't just be amplifying; you'll be a strategic storyteller for a platform that is redefining scale, speed, and reliability—from serverless functions to AI inference at the edge. We need a communicator with the technical depth to earn the trust of the most sophisticated developers and the strategic vision to position Cloudflare as the definitive platform for builders.</p>
<p>You’ll be the critical bridge between our engineering innovation and the global technical community, directly shaping perception across mainstream, tech and developer media.</p>
<p>This role will report to the Senior Director of Public Relations and will collaborate with multiple teams including Developer Relations, Customer Advocacy, Product Marketing, Partnerships, Sales, Analyst Relations and Social Media. You’ll have the opportunity to build strong relationships with a range of product and engineering leaders and will work closely with our top executives to craft bylines, press releases, speaking submissions/talks, and media material.&nbsp; You will drive communications for pivotal product launches and developer announcements and craft proactive, organic moments on key trends to educate the market on Cloudflare’s technology and developer platform. You’ll also lead these activities with our global PR agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Your Mission&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Own the Cloudflare Developer Story: </strong>Become the comms leader for the Workers platform, driving the narrative around the hottest topics: serverless, edge computing, full-stack development, and generative AI.</li>
	<li><strong>Fuel the Fire: </strong>Partner closely with Developer Relations, Product Marketing, and our visionary engineering and product leaders. You'll translate technical deep-dives into compelling, high-impact press releases, bylines, and speaking submissions that resonate globally.</li>
	<li><strong>Executive Ghostwriter: </strong>Work directly with our top executives and technical VPs (CTOs, VPs of Engineering) to craft authentic, authoritative thought leadership that moves markets.</li>
	<li><strong>Strategic Campaign Design: </strong>Drive communications for massive product launches and developer announcements. Beyond the launch, you’ll craft proactive, organic moments on key trends to educate the market and create conversation—not just join it.</li>
	<li><strong>Global Command: </strong>Coordinate across our global PR agencies and international teams to ensure a unified, high-impact message worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You’ll Bring&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Deep Tech Credibility:</strong> Proven experience in technology and product communications, ideally combining in-house leadership (or high-growth startup experience) with agency expertise.</li>
	<li><strong>Technical Fluency: </strong>You're not just familiar with the terms—you understand the&nbsp;<em>implications</em> of edge computing, serverless, microservices, and modern AI/ML workloads. You can hold your own in a conversation with a Principal Engineer.</li>
	<li><strong>Trendspotter &amp; Translator:</strong> The ability to not only identify trending developer topics but to confidently communicate and pitch Cloudflare’s unique, game-changing angle to drive conversation and Tier 1 coverage.</li>
	<li><strong>Demonstrated DevRel Partnership:</strong> Deep, demonstrable experience working directly with technical, developer-focused media, and a successful track record of translating complex, developer-centric stories for mainstream business and trade audiences. You know the developer media landscape–the publications, newsletters, podcasts, and influencers–and this is where you get your news daily.</li>
	<li><strong>The Go-Getter Ethos: </strong>Highly creative, proactive, and resilient. You thrive in a dynamic, high-growth environment where you operate independently, manage chaos, and possess a strong "make it happen" attitude.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>
<p>Compensation may be adjusted depending on work location.</p>
<ul>
	<li><span data-sheets-root="1">For Bay Area based hires: Estimated annual salary of $185,000 - $235,000</span></li>
