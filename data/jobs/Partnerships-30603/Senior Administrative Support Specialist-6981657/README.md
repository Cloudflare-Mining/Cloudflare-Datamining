<p><strong>About the role</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This role is to support two senior leaders, requiring meticulous attention to detail, expert travel &amp; logistics planning skills, and the ability to anticipate needs with minimal direction. It also requires the ability to work with team members at all levels, sometimes under pressure. A high level of integrity and discretion in handling confidential information is important, as is a positive attitude. The ideal candidate is a seasoned EA who understands the value in cultivating relationships and prides themselves on being a career EA. The role involves complex itinerary management, visa processing, and the ability to quickly adapt to changing circumstances. Confidentiality and a proactive approach are paramount.</p>

Ensure the leaders are equipped with all the necessary meeting information and manage inbound and outbound requests. If you enjoy “playing Tetris” with different Time Zones and schedules to help people get together, that would be a plus!</li>
