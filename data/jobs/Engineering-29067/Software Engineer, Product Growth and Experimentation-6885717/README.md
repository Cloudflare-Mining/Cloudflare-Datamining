<h4><strong>About the Department</strong></h4>
<p>The Growth Engineering team is responsible for building world-class experiences that help the millions of Cloudflare self-service customers get what they need faster, from acquisition and onboarding all the way through to adoption and scale up. Our team is focused on high velocity experimentation and thoughtful optimizations to that experience on Cloudflare’s properties.</p>
<p>This team has a dual mandate, also focusing on evolving our current marketing attribution, customer event ingress and experimentation capabilities that process billions of events across those properties to drive data-driven decision making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an engineer for the team responsible for Data Capture and Experimentation, your job will be to deliver on those growth-driven features and experiences while evolving our current marketing attribution, consumer event ingress and experimentation setup across these experiences, and partner with many teams on implementations.</p>
<h4><strong>About the Role</strong></h4>
<p>We are looking for experienced full-stack engineers to join the Experimentation and Data Capture team. The ideal candidate will have experience working with large-scale applications, familiarity with event-driven data capture, and strong understanding of system design. You must care deeply not only about the quality of your and the team's code, but also the customer experience and developer experience. We have a great opportunity to evolve our current data capture and experimentation systems to better serve our customers.</p>
<p>We are also strong believers in dog-fooding our own products. From cache configuration to Cloudflare Access, Cloudflare Workers, and Zaraz, these are all tools in our engineer's tool belt, so it is a plus if you have been a customer of ours, even as a free user.</p>
<p>The Experimentation and Data Capture Engineering Team will be responsible for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Technical delivery for Experimentation and Data Capture capabilities intended for all of our customer-facing UI properties, driving user acquisition, engagement, and retention through data-driven strategies and technical implementations</li>
	<li>Collaborate with product, design and stakeholders to establish outcome measurements, roadmaps and key deliverables</li>
	<li>Own and lead execution of engineering projects in the area of web data acquisition and experimentation</li>
	<li>Work across the entire product lifecycle from conceptualization through production</li>
	<li>Build features end-to-end: front-end, back-end, IaC, system design, debugging and testing, engaging with feature teams and data processing teams</li>
	<li>Inspire and mentor less experienced engineers</li>
	<li>Work closely with the trust and safety team to handle any compliance or data privacy-related matters</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Comfort with building reusable SDKs and UI components with TypeScript/JavaScript required, comfort/familiarity with other languages (Go/Rust/Python) a plus.</li>
	<li>Experience building with high-scale serverless systems like Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, etc.</li>
	<li>Design and execute A/B tests and experiments to optimize for business KPIs, including user onboarding, feature adoption, and overall product experience. Create reusable components for other developers to leverage.</li>
	<li>Experience with publishing-to and querying-from data lake/warehouse products like Clickhouse, Apache Iceberg, to evaluate experiments. Familiarity with commercial analytics systems (Adobe Analytics, Google BigQuery, etc) a plus.</li>
	<li>Implement tracking and attribution systems to understand user behavior and measure the effectiveness of growth initiatives.</li>
	<li>Familiarity with event driven architectures, high-scale data processing, issues that can occur and how to protect against them.</li>
	<li>Familiarity with global data privacy requirements governed by laws like GDPR/CCPA/etc, and the implications for data capture, modeling, and analysis.</li>
	<li>Desire to work in a very fast-paced environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>
<p>Compensation may be adjusted depending on work location.</p>
