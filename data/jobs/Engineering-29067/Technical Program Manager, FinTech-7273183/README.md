<p>Here are a few tips:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Role Requirements (Must-Have Skills)</strong></p>

<p>Other important information includes education, experience, certifications and knowledge of specific platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Nice-to-Have Skills</strong></p>
<p>If there are any other qualities that are nice to have, include those here. Don’t feel like you have to include this section, but it may help candidates know what to include in the application or interview to stand out. This section is lower priority and should have fewer bullet points.</p>
