<p>Cloudflare’s Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles large amounts of requests on the Internet today. We also build and run the internal tools and platforms that run that software. Individual engineering teams are typically responsible for large areas with considerable impact, and able to execute autonomously within that space to deliver value to their customers - be they internal or external.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of Cloudflare’s critical internal services run on Kubernetes. These services include those responsible for Cloudflare’s control plane and APIs, data analytics and other internal tools used to manage our global network. These Kubernetes platforms are purpose-built from the ground up and run on bare metal Linux in different regions around the world. The scale we work at involves tens of thousands of containers and terabits per second of network traffic. The team takes pride in knowing this platform helps run parts of the global Internet.</p>
<p><strong>About the team and the role</strong></p>
<p>The Engineering Platform and Productivity team has a charter to build a self-service, resilient, and scalable platform using a combination of Open Source projects, intellectual property, and internal infrastructure. The charter includes to build tools and services that help easily integrate a base set of capabilities into Cloudflare’s products. These services have cross cutting concerns that 100s of fellow engineers use as the building blocks at Cloudflare. The team also writes services that is redundant for each product development team to build and that serve high volumes of requests every day.</p>
