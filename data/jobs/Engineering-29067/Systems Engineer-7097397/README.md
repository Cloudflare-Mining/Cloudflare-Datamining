<p><strong>Systems Engineer</strong></p>
<p><strong>About the Department</strong></p>
<p>Emerging Technologies &amp; Incubation (ETI) is where new and bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a hugely successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers. Cloudflare’s edge and network make it possible to solve problems at massive scale and efficiency which would be impossible for almost any other organization.</p>
<p><strong>About the Team</strong></p>
<p>Our team builds on top of the Cloudflare development platform, pushing its limits to deliver tooling ranging from open source dev-tooling contributions to bespoke Enterprise-grade product solutions for massive-traffic volumes and bespoke customer demands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What started with Cloudflare Zaraz - a solution that made third-party tooling safer, faster, and more privacy-conscious - has grown into a broader mandate. Today, our scope has broadened to include stewardship of CDNJS, the open source Managed Components project, and a range of strategic initiatives focused on empowering developers with more control over data privacy and analytics.</p>
<p>At our core, we’re building new ways to help web application owners streamline development and accelerate growth on the Internet.</p>
<p>We are a tight-knit team, communicating &amp; collaborating regularly. We like to celebrate our achievements, support each other when we make mistakes, and hold each other and our work to the highest standard.</p>
<p><strong>What you'll do</strong></p>
<p>In this role, you will join world-class engineers in shaping new products built entirely on Cloudflare’s global network, while continuing to nurture the growing impact of existing offerings - ensuring continual reliability, best-in-class performance, and the implementation of new features and functionality.</p>
<p>You will be encouraged to bring your ideas forward and own your code from inception to release, delivering solutions at every layer of the software stack to empower Cloudflare customers. On any given day, you might:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Write a design document outlining your strategy to tackle a specific challenge.</li>
	<li>Ship a new feature that integrates multiple technologies.</li>
	<li>Fix a bug affecting how our user experience renders.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can expect to work with a variety of languages and technologies including, but not limited to, TypeScript, Go, and Rust. We use Cloudflare Workers heavily and creatively. If applicable to ongoing projects, you will also help maintain the health and availability of services by participating in an on-call rotation.</p>

	<li>You take pride in shipping effective, reliable code.</li>
	<li>You are energized by learning new skills, tackling challenging debugging sessions, and sharing your knowledge with others.</li>
	<li>You believe that thorough documentation is just as important as delivering code.</li>
	<li>You want to join a team that upholds a culture of support, open and honest communication, and collaborative problem-solving.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of Desirable Skills, Knowledge, and Experience</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>2+ years of experience working with high-volume software applications, with a strong focus on the TypeScript programming language.</li>

	<p><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"><strong>1.1.1.1</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We released</span><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1.1.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our</span><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver"> privacy commitment</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.</span></p>
