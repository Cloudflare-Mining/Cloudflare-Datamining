<p><strong>Role Summary</strong></p>
<p>Back in 2014, Cloudflare launched Universal SSL to provide all of our customers with the security of encrypted traffic between visitors and Cloudflare’s network. On the day we flipped the switch, we doubled the amount of sites using SSL/TLS on the internet. Since then, we’ve been working on providing even more ways to encrypt traffic easier and more effectively. To better serve our customers, we’re constantly improving our systems for issuing, managing, and deploying TLS certificates. By joining Cloudflare’s SSL/TLS Team, you can help ensure that every site owner has the ability to provide their users with a secure connection.</p>
<p>Your code will help ensure millions of websites have access to encryption. As such, the results of your code will be felt by millions of site owners and billions of visitors every day. We’re continuously providing technology to site owners that was previously only available to the largest organizations. Your contributions will help make the web a faster, safer, better, and more heavily encrypted place.</p>
