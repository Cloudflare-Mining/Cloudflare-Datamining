<p><strong>About Role</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for experienced and highly motivated engineers to join our DATA Org and help build the future of data at Cloudflare. Our organisation is responsible for the entire data lifecycle - from ingestion and processing to storage and retrieval - powering the critical logs and analytics that provide our customers with real-time visibility into the health and performance of their online properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our mission is to empower customers to leverage their data to drive better outcomes for their business. We build and maintain a suite of high-performance, scalable systems that handle more than a billion events in a second. As an engineer in our organisation, you will have the opportunity to work on complex distributed systems challenges across different parts of our data stack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Data Organisation is strategically composed of several key teams, each focusing on a distinct aspect of our comprehensive data platform:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Data Delivery / Data Pipeline: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">This team is responsible for the design, development, and operation of our distributed data delivery pipeline. This system is a high-throughput, low-latency powerhouse, primarily written in Go, and is tasked with ingesting, processing, and intelligently routing massive volumes of data originating from across Cloudflare’s vast global network to multiple core destinations. This involves handling diverse data types and ensuring reliable, timely delivery to various downstream systems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

This team is dedicated to building and maintaining a high-performance, scalable database platform meticulously optimised for the immense analytical workloads generated by all of Cloudflare’s products and services. This includes ensuring data integrity, query optimisation, and continuous platform scalability to meet ever-growing demands.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Data Retrieval (Customer-Facing Products): </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">This department is focused on building and continuously improving our customer-facing products, making data not only accessible but also genuinely actionable for our users. This department comprises two main groups:</span></li>
	<ul>
		<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Analytics and Alerts: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of this group are at the forefront of developing our public APIs such as the GraphQL Analytics API, providing customers and internal Cloudflare teams with flexible access to their data. They will also work on our alerting platform, empowering users to configure and receive near real-time alerts based on the critical logs and metrics observed by our robust data platform. This includes designing intuitive alerting mechanisms and ensuring the reliability of notification systems.</span></li>
		<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Logs and Audit Logs: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">This specialised team is dedicated to building a robust and easy-to-use logging platform that powers reliable data delivery and seamless integrations with customer destinations. The team’s mission is to make it simple for customers to access, manage, and use their log data — ensuring that critical datasets, including comprehensive audit logs, are delivered securely and efficiently to their preferred storage and analysis platforms. The work spans developing intuitive connectors, ensuring data integrity, optimising delivery pipelines, and upholding strict standards for compliance, performance, and usability.</span></li>
