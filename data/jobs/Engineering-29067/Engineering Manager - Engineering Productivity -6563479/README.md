		<p>At Cloudflare, we are on a mission to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies.

Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare.

<h4><strong>This Role is available in the following Locations:&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>London, UK</p>
<p>Lisbon, Portugal&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>About the Department</strong></h4>
<p>Cloudflare’s Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles large amounts of requests on the Internet today. We also build and run the internal tools and platforms that run that software. Individual engineering teams are typically responsible for large areas with considerable impact, and able to execute autonomously within that space to deliver value to their customers - be they internal or external.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>What you'll do</strong></h4>
<p>You will lead a team of passionate, talented engineers that are building innovative products that touch billions of web requests each day. In this role, you will introduce tools and processes to make our engineers’ lives better. You will play an active part in shaping product strategy based on what’s technically possible. You will make sure our company hits our ambitious goals from an engineering standpoint.</p>
<p>You bring a passion for meeting business needs with technically innovative solutions and excel at shifting between the two—understanding how big-picture goals inform technical details, and vice-versa. You thrive in a fast-paced iterative engineering environment and have experience in delivering scalable distributed systems. Most importantly, you have a track record of past teams who respect you as both a technical leader and manager.</p>
<p><strong>About the team</strong></p>
<p>The Engineering Productivity Team has a charter to build tools and services that help easily integrate a base set of capabilities into Cloudflare’s products. These services have cross cutting concerns that 100s of fellow engineers use as the building blocks at Cloudflare. The team also writes customer-facing software that is redundant for each product development team to build and serve high volumes of requests every day.</p>
<h3><strong>Desirable skills, knowledge and experience</strong></h3>

	<li>Demonstrate a track record of managing a team including hiring, onboarding, and professional development. You inspire your team to reach higher. You’re as good as explaining “why” as you are “how”</li>
	<li>Experience implementing tools, process, internal instrumentation, methodologies and resolving blockages</li>
	<li>Comfortable managing teams/projects with competing priorities and short release cycles</li>
	<li>Familiarity with networking terminology, tooling, patterns, and technologies.</li>

	<p><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"><strong>1.1.1.1</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We released</span><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1.1.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our</span><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver"> privacy commitment</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.</span></p>
