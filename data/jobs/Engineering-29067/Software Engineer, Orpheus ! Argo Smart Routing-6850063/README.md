<p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p>
<p>The Orpheus team was formed to own a very important aspect of Cloudflare's systems: enable more reliable network connectivity for Cloudflare’s products than the Internet itself provides.<br><br>Almost all products in Cloudflare’s portfolio are or will be powered by Orpheus technology, including CDN, Spectrum, Magic Transit, Stream, Workers, Workers AI, R2, WARP, and more. As a member of the Orpheus team, you’ll be a key technical contributor to the cutting edge network software infrastructure used by those products.</p>
<p>You will work closely with various Engineering teams to translate their requirements into new capabilities on the platform. Likewise you will partner with Network Engineering and SRE to ensure that the technology makes the best use of Cloudflare's world-class edge network.</p>
<p>You will participate in all stages of the software development lifecycle, from designing and documenting systems, to writing code and automated tests, to planning, managing, and monitoring production software deployments. You will work with a wide range of technologies and programming languages, including Rust, Go, Linux networking, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, Grafana, Kubernetes, and more.</p>
<p>Engineering teams at Cloudflare operate a Run What You Build model, including ours. We are responsible for the health of our system and participate in our team's on-call rotation as part of operational responsibilities.</p>
<p>Because you’ll be solving problems of massive scale and significance, you are a growth-oriented individual who enjoys being outside of your comfort zone. You are comfortable in a fast-paced but sensible work environment. You value curiosity and empathy and lead with these values.</p>

	<p><strong>What Makes Cloudflare Special?</strong></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.</span></p>
	<p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/protecting-free-expression-online/"><strong>Project Galileo</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.</span></p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/">Athenian Project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.</span></p>
	<p><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"><strong>1.1.1.1</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We released</span><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1.1.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our</span><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver"> privacy commitment</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.</span></p>
