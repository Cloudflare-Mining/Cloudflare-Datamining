Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare.

<p><strong>Role Summary</strong></p>
<p>The mission of the Traffic team is to build software systems that improve the performance and reliability of Cloudflare's network. The scope of our work is significant and has a broad impact across our portfolio of products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such system is a control plane service that ingests a diverse set of data in order to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/meet-traffic-manager/">load-balance customer traffic</a> through directly instructing our network infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Role Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>As a member of the Traffic team you will build and extend various traffic management and supporting systems. You will work closely with Network Engineering, Product Engineering, Network Strategy, and other teams to translate their requirements into new capabilities on our platform.&nbsp;</p>

You will work with a wide range of technologies and programming languages, including Go, Python, Rust, ClickHouse, Salt, PostgreSQL, Grafana, Kubernetes, NETCONF, and more.</p>
<p>Our team at Cloudflare operates under a "Run What You Build" model. This means we are responsible for the health of our systems and actively participate in our team's on-call rotation as part of our operational duties.</p>
<p>Because you’ll be solving problems of massive scale and significance, and shaping the future of reliability and performance on the Internet, you are a growth-oriented individual who enjoys being outside of your comfort zone.

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/">Athenian Project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.</span></p>
	<p><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"><strong>1.1.1.1</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We released</span><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1.1.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our</span><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver"> privacy commitment</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.</span></p>
