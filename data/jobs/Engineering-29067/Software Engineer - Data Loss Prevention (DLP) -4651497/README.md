		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare.

<p><strong>About the Team</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare helps build the future of the Internet. We started Cloudflare to solve one half of every IT organization's challenge: how do you ensure the resources and infrastructure that you expose to the Internet are safe from attack, fast, and reliable. We saw that the world was moving away from hardware and software to solve these problems and instead wanted a scalable service that would work around the world. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To deliver that, we built one of the world's largest networks. Today our network spans more than 250 cities worldwide and is within milliseconds of nearly everyone connected to the Internet. We have built the capacity to stand up to nation-state scale cyberattacks and a threat intelligence system powered by the immense amount of Internet traffic that we see.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are now expanding Cloudflare’s product offerings to solve the other half of every IT organization's challenge: ensuring the people and teams within an organization can access the tools they need to do their jobs and are safe from malware and other online threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do that, we released </span><a href="https://teams.cloudflare.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare for Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Zero Trust platform built on Cloudflare’s network to secure users, devices, and data in organizations of any size. Cloudflare for Teams consists of multiple products that deliver a comprehensive solution. Those products include</span></p>
