		<p>At Cloudflare, we are on a mission to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>About the team</h3>
<p>We are a team of software engineers who build distributed systems critical to keeping Cloudflare’s network operating smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<p>We work with the latest Linux network technologies and low-level details of network protocols. But we're also responsible for sophisticated automated control systems.&nbsp; The code we write runs on thousands of servers in hundreds of data centres around the world.</p>
<p>As the scale of Cloudflare's network and the variety of services we offer continue to grow, so do the challenges we tackle.</p>
<h3>What you'll do</h3>
<p>You’ll participate in the<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/"> ongoing development of a load distribution system that works</a> at the scale of Cloudflare’s edge network. Millions of users and customers depend upon this system every hour of every day, even if it isn’t visible to them. You’ll take on challenging projects that require focus and determination, pragmatism and innovation, and careful consideration of risk. You’ll get to know the details of Cloudflare’s software and hardware infrastructure in order to design software that behaves well even when failures occur. You’ll collaborate with engineers across the company, from operations teams to the teams that build our customer-facing products. You’ll inspect the production behaviour of our systems, to check that they are working as intended and spot opportunities for improvement. You’ll be part of the on-call rota for the occasional cases when our operations teams need to escalate problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/">Athenian Project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.</span></p>
	<p><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"><strong>1.1.1.1</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We released</span><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1.1.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our</span><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver"> privacy commitment</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.</span></p>
