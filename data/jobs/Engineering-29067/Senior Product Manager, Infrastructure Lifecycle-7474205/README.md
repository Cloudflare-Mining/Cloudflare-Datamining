<p><strong>Available Locations: Austin TX, Denver CO and Washington DC</strong></p>
<p><strong>About the role</strong></p>
<p>Cloudflare’s network protects over 20% of the Internet which translates to over trillions of requests per month. We’re looking for a product manager who will help build the systems and processes that allow us to order, deploy, and manage our infrastructure at scale to meet the needs of our rapidly increasing customer base.</p>
<h4><strong>What you'll do</strong></h4>
<p>The Infrastructure Lifecycle PM will build systems and processes that will enable us to grow efficiently. You will lead the transformation by driving critical initiatives like comprehensive ERP integration and building improvements to dramatically reduce hardware deployment time and accelerate our growth. Another key focus will be achieving perfect visibility, mastering the challenge of asset accuracy by implementing systems to know the exact location and status of every piece of hardware, which will maximize in-service time through strategic repair programs and minimize wasteful idle inventory. Additionally, you will empower stakeholders by improving visibility into asset inventory to support crucial capacity planning and provide essential, real-time metrics on compliance and security to all teams. Finally, you will ensure resilience and business continuity by elevating our operational standards to ensure all maintenance processes are completely non-impacting to customers, mandating that every product has a robust failure strategy aligned with business continuity, and building the necessary tools to enforce these customer requirements across every product failure domain in our infrastructure.</p>
<p>As a member of a growing team of infrastructure product managers your responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Represent the customer, be it internal or external. Be the champion and voice of customers. Build intimate, personal customer relationships. Bring the customer's voice into the creation process.</li>

	<li>Evangelize the vision so that all stakeholders are aligned, have context and understand where we are going.</li>
	<li>Make data-driven roadmap decisions.&nbsp; Make tough tactical prioritization decisions based off of data you collect, curate, and disseminate.&nbsp; Build trust with stakeholders by ensuring that your roadmap is understandable and sensible based on the data you present.</li>
	<li>Measure success. Own the measures used to define success for your product. Success measures must be defined at the inception of a product and tracked throughout its lifecycle. Make measures visible to all stakeholders and interpret them into actionable conclusions and new hypotheses.</li>
	<li>Author use cases and prioritize requirements. Translate observations and customer feedback into a prioritized product backlog.&nbsp; Author use cases based on specific real-world product applications and extrapolate detailed product requirements for the scenarios.</li>
	<li>Collaborate across teams. We win or lose as a team. Product managers play a critical role in creating alignment between engineering teams and stakeholders. A collaborative attitude is essential to the job.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h4>
<p>The ideal candidate is customer-focused, data-driven, methodical and thrives in a goal-oriented and data-driven environment.&nbsp; You have a deep technical understanding of the observability space and outstanding communication and collaboration skills.&nbsp; You are able to work with a diverse group, get consensus, and drive the product forward.&nbsp; You are execution focused, you emphasize getting things done while paying attention to important details.

	<li>Experience presenting new products and features to customers – whether as a developer, analyst or product manager. You are enthusiastic about taking something you have helped build and sharing it with the world</li>
	<li>Strong customer and stakeholder empathy. You must be the voice of engineering, customers, support, or ops at any given time. You must be able to channel many points of view into a strategic roadmap and deliverables that provide elegant solutions to all requirements.</li>
