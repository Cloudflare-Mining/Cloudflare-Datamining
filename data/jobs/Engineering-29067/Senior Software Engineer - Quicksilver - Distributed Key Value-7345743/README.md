<p>Quicksilver is Cloudflare’s globally distributed key-value store. It replicates our data all around the world, over tens of thousands of servers and over 500 data centers. It handles all kinds of network conditions and serves billions of keys per second.&nbsp;In this role, you can expect to see&nbsp;challenges like unexpected network issues, hardware failures, kernel bugs and still have to deliver the data to the edge in a fast and reliable way. Along with the rest of the team,&nbsp;you will own and support the whole stack: the code base, the unit and integration test, deployment and rollback plans, operations, monitoring, alerting, debugging and on-call.&nbsp;Quicksilver is written in Go and C.&nbsp;If working at this scale excites you and you are intrigued by very tricky bugs, rather than being scared by them, you might be a match for this role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your daily duties will be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Working on our distributed large scale key-value store, you will write new features in Go and reviewing pull request</li>
	<li>Improving performance, CPU, memory usage, etc.</li>
	<li>Improving our monitoring and our tools, all written in Go</li>
	<li>Help with debugging and investigating hard to reproduce problems</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>You have previous experience writing robust systems, code quality, performance and technical debt. You understand the tradeoffs that doing rigorous engineering requires.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You have proven experience with storage systems, peer to peer systems, large scale distributed systems or simply system programming in general.</li>
	<li>You have previous experience of chasing problems through multiple layers of our software stack. You can be flexible and you are very curious.</li>
	<li>You are flexible and very autonomous. You won’t be micromanaged in this role and will be looked to have experience thinking out of the box and coming up with simple and smart designs for complex issues.</li>
	<li>You have a previous track record of being pragmatic and believe in the value of simple solutions.</li>
	<li>You equally enjoy low-level and high-level programming. You have a taste for programming languages.</li>
	<li>You enjoy being a part of a team that challenges each other's designs -- you are good at taking and giving constructive criticism with a goal of producing the best solution.</li>
	<li>You are not afraid of engaging in outages on anti-social hours.</li>
</ul>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/">Athenian Project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.</span></p>
	<p><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"><strong>1.1.1.1</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We released</span><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1.1.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our</span><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver"> privacy commitment</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.</span></p>
