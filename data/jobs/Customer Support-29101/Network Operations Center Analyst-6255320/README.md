The NOC service will focus on monitoring, alerting, and addressing issues related to availability and latency degradation in Layer 7 traffic, as well as handling basic security escalations and offering recommendations to mitigate fundamental attacks. The NOC system will monitor HTTP requests for alert-able conditions, and our NOC team will alert customers about problems as soon as they are found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOC Engineers analyze the alerts, inform the customer of any material impact, and proactively put in motion a remediation path to resolving the degraded service, whether that be by moving traffic through a new route or working with the Systems Reliability Engineering team for a quick product fix or to declare a broader incident.
