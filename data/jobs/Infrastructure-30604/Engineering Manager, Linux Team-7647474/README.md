<p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lead and Mentor:</strong> Manage a high-performing team of kernel and systems engineers, fostering a culture of "collaboration-first" and continuous knowledge sharing both internally and with the global open-source community.</li>
	<li><strong>Own the OS Lifecycle:</strong> Oversee the end-to-end delivery of the Linux Kernel and core OS components. Your goal is a fully automated continuous delivery pipeline that moves from merge to 100% production in less than 30 days.</li>
	<li><strong>Drive Technical Vision:</strong> Steer the Cloudflare kernel development roadmap. You will balance the need for cutting-edge features with the absolute requirements of production stability, security, and performance.</li>
	<li><strong>Upstream Advocacy:</strong> Promote a "minimal patch" philosophy by ensuring your team is a top contributor to the Linux Kernel. You will support engineers in becoming upstream maintainers for critical subsystems.</li>
	<li><strong>Cross-Functional Collaboration:</strong> Act as a consultant to hardware and service teams, helping them onboard new hardware and optimize workloads for our OS. You’ll lead a "virtual team" environment where any engineer at Cloudflare can contribute to the kernel.</li>
	<li><strong>Innovate Debugging:</strong> Tackle the "impossible" challenges of kernel-level debugging. You will lead the development of automated systems that collect critical telemetry when a system crashes, even when traditional debuggers cannot run.</li>
	<li><strong>Measure Success:</strong> Use DORA metrics and team-specific capabilities - such as the "time to fix a kernel issue" and upstream commit volume - to track and improve team impact.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You’ll Bring</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Systems Leadership:</strong> 5+ years of experience managing engineering teams, ideally in low-level systems, kernel development, or large-scale infrastructure environments.</li>
	<li><strong>Low-Level Expertise:</strong> A deep understanding of Linux Kernel internals, x86/ARM architecture, and OS design fundamentals. You should be comfortable discussing memory management, schedulers, and network stacks.</li>
	<li><strong>Automation Mindset:</strong> Experience building or managing CI/CD pipelines for foundational software. You believe that "toil" is a bug and automation is the feature.</li>
	<li><strong>Open Source Pedigree:</strong> A proven track record of engaging with the open-source community. You understand the nuances of upstreaming and how to navigate community dynamics effectively.</li>
	<li><strong>Operational Empathy:</strong> An understanding of the unique challenges of a global "reboot-limited" production environment. You prioritize stability and have experience with pre-production QA and synthetic workload evaluation.</li>
	<li><strong>Strategic Communication:</strong> The ability to translate complex kernel-level obstacles into actionable business insights for stakeholders across the company.</li>
	<li><strong>Resilience:</strong> You aren't intimidated by the "impossible." Whether it's a non-reproducible race condition or an unwelcoming upstream thread, you lead your team through the challenge with a pragmatic, solution-oriented mindset.</li>
</ul>
