<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>Are you passionate about the intersection of technology, market strategy, and business growth? Do you thrive in a fast-paced environment and enjoy tackling complex, high-impact problems? Cloudflare is looking for a driven and analytical Summer 2026 MBA Strategy Intern to join our team.</p>
<p>This is a unique opportunity to work alongside Cloudflare's leadership and gain hands-on experience in shaping the future direction of a global, mission-driven company. You will contribute to projects that directly inform executive-level decision-making and Cloudflare's long-term corporate strategy.</p>
<p>The deadline to submit an application is February 22, 2026 at 11:59 PM PT.</p>
<h4><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h4>
<p>The MBA Strategy Intern will contribute to high-priority strategic initiatives across the company. While the exact projects will depend on Cloudflare’s internal priorities at the time of the internship, potential areas of focus include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>International Expansion:</strong> Conducting market and opportunity assessments, developing strategic options, and contributing to the creation of a 3-year international growth plan.</li>
	<li><strong>Regulatory Certifications:</strong> Analyzing global regulatory requirements, prioritizing certifications based on Go-to-Market (GTM) and Sales needs, and balancing resourcing within Engineering to develop a 1–2 year implementation roadmap.</li>
	<li><strong>Strategic Partnerships:</strong> Facilitating cross-functional workshops and brainstorming sessions with potential GTM or infrastructure partners in priority markets to identify and develop joint partnership options.</li>
	<li><strong>Competitive Landscape Analysis:</strong> Deep diving into emerging competitive threats and market shifts within key Cloudflare product areas (e.g., AI/ML, security, networking) to produce actionable recommendations for product and sales strategy.</li>
	<li><strong>New Product/Market Entry:</strong> Performing a strategic assessment of a potential new product category or emerging customer segment, including sizing the opportunity, evaluating entry options, and outlining a potential launch plan.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The projects listed above are examples of the high-impact work we focus on. <strong>None of these projects are guaranteed.</strong> The actual internship project(s) will be assigned based on Cloudflare's most critical business priorities at the time of the Summer 2026 internship.</p>
<h4><strong>Ideal Qualifications</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Currently enrolled in a top-tier MBA program or a Master's degree program in a relevant field (e.g., Strategy, Finance, Technology Management).</li>
	<li>Exceptional analytical and quantitative skills, with a proven ability to structure complex problems, conduct rigorous analysis (market sizing, financial modeling, competitive analysis), and synthesize findings into clear, concise, and compelling narratives.</li>
	<li>Strong communication and presentation skills, comfortable engaging with senior leaders and facilitating cross-functional discussions.</li>
	<li>A self-starter with a high degree of intellectual curiosity and a proactive approach to problem-solving.</li>
	<li>Prior experience in management consulting, corporate strategy, investment banking, or a high-growth technology company is a plus.</li>
	<li>A passion for Cloudflare's mission to help build a better Internet and a genuine interest in the underlying technologies (networking, security, edge computing, AI).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Desirable Skills, Knowledge, and Experience:</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Self-starter who enjoys working in a fast-paced, collaborative, and innovative high-growth environment.</li>
