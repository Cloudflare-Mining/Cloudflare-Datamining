<p><strong>Available Locations:&nbsp;</strong>Lisbon, Portugal&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>Cloudflare is seeking a Summer Intern to join our Infrastructure team. We build tools and systems that help plan and automate how Cloudflare’s global infrastructure grows over time. Our work connects real hardware—servers, switches, racks, power, and space—with software that models supply, demand, and deployment schedules.</p>
<p>As an intern, you’ll write code to improve internal planning workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and make infrastructure data more accessible to partner teams. This role is a great fit for students interested in data analytics and gaining exposure to real-world systems and operations.</p>
<p>This internship blends software engineering with real-world infrastructure problems. You’ll ship code that helps accelerate physical deployment at global scale, not just simulated or theoretical projects.</p>
<h4><strong>What You'll Do</strong></h4>
<p>You will contribute to areas such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Building scripts, services, or small applications to automate planning and lifecycle tasks</li>
	<li>Working with data related to infrastructure capacity and deployments</li>
	<li>Creating internal tools or dashboards to improve visibility and support decision-making</li>
	<li>Improving data quality and reducing manual processes</li>
	<li>Collaborating with engineers to integrate planning logic into existing systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects are scoped to support learning, mentorship, and iteration throughout the internship.</p>
<p><strong>Who You’ll Work With</strong></p>
<p>You will collaborate with engineers and planners across:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Infrastructure Capacity Planning</li>
	<li>Supply Chain &amp; Procurement</li>
	<li>Data Center Operations</li>

	<li>Available for a full-time 12-week internship, working from our Lisbon office 3-5 days a week during the summer (May-August)</li>
	<li>Programming experience in at least one language (Python, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, or similar), as well as experience with data querying tools (e.g., BigQuery)</li>
	<li>Professional proficiency in English</li>
	<li>Interest in data analytics, data, or infrastructure</li>
	<li>Curiosity about how large-scale systems are built and operated</li>
