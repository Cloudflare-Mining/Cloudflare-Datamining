<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>As an AI Automation Intern, you will be at the tactical center of integrating an acquired target company into Cloudflare. Your mission is to solve the "fragmentation problem" by centralizing tracking and updates from various workstreams—such as HR, Finance, and IT—into a unified view of progress. We are looking for an <strong>intellectually curious "scrapper"</strong> who proactively looks for ways to solve problems with minimal guidance. Whether you build an agent from scratch or leverage existing AI tools like Gemini and NotebookLM, your goal is to make it easier for the M&amp;A team to manage the overall integration.</p>
<h4><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h4>

	<li><strong>Tactical Project Automation:</strong> Build "quick and dirty" or structured solutions to automate the "chasing" of action items, gathering status updates, and reminding the deal team of past decisions.</li>
	<li><strong>Knowledge Retrieval:</strong> Use AI tools to organize and query past meeting notes and deal documents so the team can instantly recall critical commitments.</li>
	<li><strong>Process Documentation:</strong> Write clear technical requirement specifications and process maps that detail how these automated tracking and reporting workflows function.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Must-Have Skills:</strong></h4>

	<li>Available for a full-time 12-week internship, working from one of our US hub offices 3-5 days a week during the summer (May-August).</li>
	<li><strong>Intellectual Curiosity:</strong> A natural drive to explore new technologies and a "figure it out" mentality when faced with ambiguous tasks or minimal guidance.</li>
	<li><strong>AI &amp; Automation Fluency:</strong> Practical experience using LLM interfaces (like Gemini or NotebookLM) or automation platforms to organize unstructured data and summarize complex information.</li>
	<li><strong>Analytical Writing:</strong> Strong ability to draft technical documentation and translate messy project management hurdles into logical, automated workflows.</li>
	<li><strong>Autonomous Execution:</strong> Proven ability to manage a project from an initial "messy" idea through to a functional, validated solution.</li>
