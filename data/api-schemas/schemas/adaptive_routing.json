For example, zero-downtime failover occurs immediately when an origin becomes unavailable due to HTTP 521, 522, or 523 response codes. If there is another healthy origin in the same pool, the request is retried once against this alternate origin.",

When set false (the default) zero-downtime failover will only occur between origins within the same pool. See `session_affinity_attributes` for control over when sessions are broken or reassigned.",
