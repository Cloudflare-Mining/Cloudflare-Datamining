Specifically, neural networks are used in <a href='/learning/ai/what-is-deep-learning/'>deep learning</a> — an advanced type of machine learning that can draw conclusions from unlabeled data without human intervention. For instance, a deep learning model built on a neural network and fed sufficient training data could be able to identify items in a photo it has never seen before.</p>\n\n<img class=\"responsive-image--50-pct-center\" title=\"What is a neural network? - example\" alt=\"A neural network composed of nodes divided into an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer identifies a photo of a cat\" src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1wkNx98skWwkKAw2XExpQe/33505b0b82e3156fc042bca42a1a2034/neural-network-diagram.png\" itemprop=\"image\">\n\n<p>Neural networks make many types of <a href='/learning/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/'>artificial intelligence (AI)</a> possible. <a href='/learning/ai/what-is-large-language-model/'>Large language models (LLMs)</a> such as ChatGPT, AI image generators like DALL-E, and <a href='/learning/ai/what-is-predictive-ai/'>predictive AI</a> models all rely to some extent on neural networks.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"learning-content-h2\" itemprop=\"headline\">How do neural networks work?</h2>\n\n<p>Neural networks are composed of a collection of nodes. The nodes are spread out across at least three layers. The three layers are:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"learning-list\">\n  <li>An input layer</li>\n  <li>A \"hidden\" layer</li>\n  <li>An output layer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These three layers are the minimum. Neural networks can have more than one hidden layer, in addition to the input layer and output layer.</p>\n\n<p>No matter which layer it is part of, each node performs some sort of processing task or function on whatever input it receives from the previous node (or from the input layer). Essentially, each node contains a mathematical formula, with each variable within the formula weighted differently. If the output of applying that mathematical formula to the input exceeds a certain threshold, the node passes data to the next layer in the neural network. If the output is below the threshold, no data is passed to the next layer.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine that the Acme Corporation has an accounting department with a strict hierarchy. Acme accounting department employees at the manager level approve expenses below $1,000, directors approve expenses below $10,000, and the CFO approves any expenses that exceed $10,000. When employees from other departments of Acme Corp. submit their expenses, they first go to the accounting managers. Any expense over $1,000 gets passed to a director, while expenses below $1,000 stay at the managerial level — and so on.</p>\n\n<p>The accounting department of the Acme Corp. functions somewhat like a neural network. When employees submit their expense reports, this is like a neural network's input layer. Each manager and director is like a node within the neural network.</p>\n\n<p>And, just as one accounting manager may ask another manager for assistance in interpreting an expense report before passing it along to an accounting director, neural networks can be architected in a variety of ways. Nodes can communicate in multiple directions.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"learning-content-h2\" itemprop=\"headline\">What are the types of neural networks?</h2>\n\n<p>There is no limit on how many nodes and layers a neural network can have, and these nodes can interact in almost any way. Because of this, the list of types of neural networks is ever-expanding. But, they can roughly be sorted into these categories:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"learning-list\">\n  <li><strong>Shallow neural networks</strong> usually have only one hidden layer</li>\n  <li><strong>Deep neural networks</strong> have multiple hidden layers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Shallow neural networks are fast and require less processing power than deep neural networks, but they cannot perform as many complex tasks as deep neural networks.</p>\n\n<p>Below is an incomplete list of the types of neural networks that may be used today:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Perceptron</strong> neural networks are simple, shallow networks with an input layer and an output layer.</p>\n\n<img class=\"responsive-image--50-pct-center\" title=\"Perceptron neural network\" alt=\"Two nodes in input layer and one node in output layer\" src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6lYdZzP5saZx78yNhYnJmc/aa2abda34f426fa0d3b9137592cba332/Perceptron.png\" itemprop=\"image\">\n\n<p><strong>Multilayer perceptron</strong> neural networks add complexity to perceptron networks, and include a hidden layer.</p>\n\n<img class=\"responsive-image--50-pct-center\" title=\"Multilayer perceptron neural network\" alt=\"Two nodes in input layer, two nodes in hidden layer, and one node in output layer\" src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1I459b6ne8fror4e5XNbxJ/6527eabd1e8c0042121242566dbf52ec/multilayer-perceptron-neural-network.png\" itemprop=\"image\">\n\n<p><strong>Feed-forward</strong> neural networks only allow their nodes to pass information to a forward node.</p>\n\n<img class=\"responsive-image--50-pct-center\" title=\"Feed-forward neural network\" alt=\"Data passes forward between nodes.

Via self-attention, they can detect even subtle ways that parts of a data set relate to each other.</p>\n\n<p>This ability makes them ideal for analyzing (for example) sentences and paragraphs of text, as opposed to just individual words and phrases. Before transformer models were developed, AI models that processed text would often \"forget\" the beginning of a sentence by the time they got to the end of it, with the result that they would combine phrases and ideas in ways that did not make sense to human readers. Transformer models, however, can process and generate human language in a much more natural way.</p>\n\n<p>Transformer models are an integral component of <a href='/learning/ai/what-is-generative-ai/'>generative AI</a>, in particular LLMs that can produce text in response to arbitrary human prompts.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"learning-content-h2\" itemprop=\"headline\">History of neural networks</h2>\n\n<p>Neural networks are actually quite old. The concept of neural networks <a href='https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/neural-networks/History/history1.html' target='_blank'>can be dated</a> to a 1943 mathematical paper that modeled how the brain could work. Computer scientists began attempting to construct simple neural networks in the 1950s and 1960s, but eventually the concept fell out of favor. In the 1980s the <a href='https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/neural-networks/History/history2.html' target='_blank'>concept was revived</a>, and by the 1990s neural networks were in widespread use in AI research.</p>\n\n<p>However, only with the advent of hyper-fast processing, massive data storage capabilities, and access to computing resources were neural networks able to advance to the point they have reached today, where they can imitate or even exceed human cognitive abilities. Developments are still being made in this field; one of the most important types of neural networks in use today, the transformer, dates to 2017.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"learning-content-h2\" itemprop=\"headline\">How does Cloudflare support neural networks?</h2>\n\n<p>With locations in more than %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world, Cloudflare is in a unique position to offer computational power to AI developers anywhere with minimal latency.

It consists of interconnected nodes organized in layers that process information and make predictions.\n</p>\n\n<h4>What are the different types of neural networks?</h4>\n<p>Neural networks come in various types based on their structure and function. Common types include shallow and deep neural networks, perceptrons, multilayer perceptrons, feed-forward and recurrent neural networks, modular networks, radial basis function networks, liquid state machines, and residual networks. Each type differs in how data flows and how layers interact, from simple forward-only designs to complex architectures that loop, skip, or combine outputs.</p>\n\n<h4>When were neural networks invented?</h4>\n<p>Neural networks date back to a 1943 mathematical model of brain function. After early development in the 1950s and 1960s, interest declined but revived in the 1980s, leading to widespread use in AI research by the 1990s.</p>\n\n<h4>How does a neural network work?</h4>\n<p>Neural networks consist of layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Each node performs a mathematical function on the input it receives and passes the output to the next node if it exceeds a threshold. Nodes can be arranged in multiple hidden layers for more complexity. Similar to an organizational hierarchy, nodes process and pass data in a structured way, with more complex decisions passed to higher layers, much like how expense reports in a company go through managers and directors based on thresholds.</p>\n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"What is a neural network?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"A neural network is a computational system inspired by the human brain that learns to perform tasks by analyzing examples.
