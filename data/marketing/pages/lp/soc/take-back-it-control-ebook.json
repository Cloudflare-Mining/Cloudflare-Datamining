The Alpargatas Group is headquartered in Brazil, but operates over 40 ecommerce platforms that serve customers around the world, including Europe, Latin America, and the United States. \n\n### Challenge: Ensuring performance and security for high-visibility brands\n\nAlpargatas owns many highly-recognizable brands in the consumer goods industry. The success of these brands depends on ensuring a positive user experience for customers around the world.\n\n\"At Alpargatas, we are committed to delight the world with amazing brands, brands that convey lightness and joy to the everyday lives of our consumers,\" says Felipe Bonomo, Executive Manager of Information Security and Privacy at Alpargatas.\n\nServing a global customer base across multiple ecommerce channels requires solutions that ensure that user traffic is quickly routed to the appropriate platform. Additionally, Alpargatas needs to protect their highly-visible brands against fraud and other potential security threats\n\n### Workers and caching ensure application performance and reliability\n\nCloudflare's global network is essential to ensure the availability and performance of Alpargatas' ecommerce platforms. With over 330 locations worldwide, the Cloudflare network is uniquely positioned to protect Alpargatas' ecommerce platforms and help Alpargatas provide a better connectivity experience to their customer base.\n\nAlpargatas uses Cloudflare Workers and Argo Smart Routing to manage and improve routing across their complex infrastructure.\n\n\"At Alpargatas, we use Workers to manage access to our ecommerce solutions around the globe,\" Bonomo says. \"With Workers, we can precisely manage traffic without harming application performance or the user experience.\"\n\n### Cloudflare WAF and Bot Management block targeted attacks\n\nAlpargatas manages high-visibility brands, including Havaianas and Rothys, a sustainable, North American footwear brand. These are common targets for cyber attacks designed to disrupt services or engage in fraudulent activities against the company.\n\nOften, these attacks involve using malicious bots to purchase and resell goods, deplete inventory, or perform credential stuffing attacks against customer accounts.\n\n\"In Brazil, there are many specialized groups engaging in fraudulent activities,\" Bonomo adds. \"Using Cloudflare to mitigate these risks with the Bot Management solution is one of the main benefits we see for Alpargatas.\"\n\n### Simplification and centralization enhance security efficiency\n\nManaging security across over 40 global ecommerce platforms can be a complex job. According to Bonomo, Cloudflare's usability and centralized management are key to the scalability of Alpargatas' security operations.\n\n\"It's very easy to manage Cloudflare's products, enabling scalable security without unnecessary complexity,\" he says. \"The interface is intuitive and makes it easy to customize rules and implement new rules and filters.\"\n\nCloudflare's diverse product catalog was also a major selling point for Alpargatas. As the company engages in a digital transformation initiative to adapt to Industry 4.0 and 5G networks, centralizing key network security capabilities in a single solution helps them streamline their security operations and scale their business with ease.\n",

								"longDescription": "## __TELUS strengthens security and improves digital experiences while eliminating legacy IT complexity with Cloudflare__\n\nTELUS is growing rapidly. Headquartered in Canada, TELUS Corporation is a dynamic, world-leading global communications technology company with more than 19 million customer connections across wireline, wireless, Internet, security, entertainment and TV services. The company is also expanding into new verticals, including health technology, agricultural technology, energy, and smart home technology.\n\nTo succeed in highly competitive markets, TELUS technology leaders are focused on building a world-class engineering organization. That team is responsible for developing innovative products and delivering outstanding digital experiences to customers across Canada and beyond. \n\n### __Defending a high-value target while facing IT complexity__\n\nAmong other technology investments, TELUS is currently migrating key workloads from on-premises data centers to the cloud. \"Moving to the cloud creates great opportunities for accelerating our pace and improving the quality of our services,\" says Steve Tannock, director of platform at TELUS. \n\nHowever, the cloud migration and other initiatives also have the potential for amplifying security challenges by expanding the company's attack surface. \"TELUS is a high-value target for attackers,\" says Tannock. \"In particular, the volume, quality, and sophistication of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are always increasing. Addressing those threats is a high priority.\"\n\nAnother challenge was a heterogeneous IT and security environment â€” which stemmed in part from the company's growth through acquisitions. \"Initially, we had very piecemeal, uneven protection. Every team, every application and every surface had its own solutions,\" says Tannock. \"Some of those solutions were delivered as physical appliances that were no longer relevant to a cloud approach.\"\n\nThe complexity of this security environment slowed incident responses and even affected retention of employees. \"We were seeing an increased number of DDoS attacks that were not mitigated. As a result, our team was spending lots of time on call, which was stressful and led to burnout,\" says Tannock. \"We needed to completely rethink how we were protecting the company.\"\n\n### __Strengthening security and consolidating tools with Cloudflare__\n\nTo transform their security strategy, TELUS began working with Cloudflare. The team implemented DDoS protection and bot management capabilities to stop attacks and prevent malicious bot activity. TELUS also deployed Cloudflare Advanced Certificate Management to secure applications with TLS certificates while avoiding manual administration. Meanwhile, the Cloudflare content delivery network (CDN) helps deliver exceptional experiences to users everywhere.\n\nThe move to Cloudflare was widely appreciated by the TELUS team. \"Many of our team members had used Cloudflare with previous companies,\" says Tannock. \"When we decided to make the move to Cloudflare at TELUS, we were all excited to work with a company that has prioritized strong engineering. We are closely aligned with Cloudflare's engineering-first culture.\" \n\nBecause Cloudflare offers a single, unified connectivity cloud, the TELUS team immediately recognized the opportunity to consolidate security tools. \"Consolidation helps us be lighter and faster,\" says Tannock. \"We can be more responsive to issues. And at the same time, with fewer tools to manage, we're reducing our team's cognitive load.\"\n\n### __Eliminating C$11.8 million in direct costs over three years__\n\nConsolidating security tools is having a tangible impact on costs. \"With our previous security providers, we had experienced increasing costs and diminishing returns,\" says Tannock. \"By moving to Cloudflare, we anticipate reducing direct costs by C$11.8 million over three years. That is a massive savings for us.\"\n\nTELUS is also driving down operational costs by reducing the need for staff overtime. \"In the first five months of this year, we saved more than a hundred hours of overtime compared with previous years,\" says Tannock. \"That's both a cost reduction and an improvement in quality of life for our teams. It's really a tremendous win.\"\n\n### __Spending less time on urgent incidents and more time on strategic priorities__\n\nWith Cloudflare security capabilities in place, the TELUS team automatically mitigates many more attacks than before â€” reducing the time to handle attacks by 95% for one high-traffic event. \"Two years ago on Black Friday, we spent 48 hours just putting out fires,\" says Tannock. \"This past year, attackers targeted us even more â€” but Cloudflare automatically mitigated every attack except one. For the remaining attack, we stopped it within an hour just by quickly adding a configuration rule.\"\n\nIncreased visibility helps the TELUS team handle threats before they escalate. \"Using the Cloudflare dashboard, we can easily see where the problems are and rapidly configure new rules to monitor or block a threat,\" says Tannock. \"Cloudflare has really transformed the way we work. Now we can spend more of our time working on strategic projects.\"\n\n### __Enhancing customer experiences by delivering better performance__\n\nWhile TELUS is using Cloudflare security capabilities to address threats, the Cloudflare network helps deliver better digital experiences for websites and apps. \"We're always thinking about our customer experiences,\" says Tannock. \"When we added Cloudflare to our website, we immediately saw a 1.4-second improvement in page response time, which is huge for us â€” and a very noticeable improvement for our customers.\"\n\nOn average, the move to Cloudflare has contributed to a 65% reduction in page load times so far. Tannock's team anticipates another 40% reduction in the future. \"Our goal is for all of our properties to load in under two seconds,\" says Tannock. \"Two years ago, we were averaging about 10 seconds. Now it's about three-and-a-half seconds. We think we can reach our goal with Cloudflare.\"\n\nThe TELUS team hopes to achieve that performance goal by moving apps to the edge. \"We're exploring ways to use Cloudflare Workers to serve apps closer to users,\" says Tannock. \"Canada is a large country, and we want to make sure that customers have responsive experiences whether they are on the West Coast, East Coast, or somewhere in between. With Cloudflare, we're rethinking how we deliver our software so we can provide a much faster experience for customers everywhere.\" \n\n### __Securing a distributed workforce and enabling continued innovation__\n\nThe TELUS team has also been investigating a Zero Trust security approach to better protect employees, whether they are working in corporate offices, retail locations, call centers, or elsewhere. \"TELUS has a globally distributed workforce, and we need to ensure that we can safeguard employees and provide the right levels of network access,\" says Tannock. \"We believe that the Cloudflare connectivity cloud will be instrumental in empowering our global employees while maintaining tight security. We can continue to deliver exceptional service and develop innovative products from anywhere.\"\n",

Known for its easy-to-use design and advanced technologies for job matching and hiring, Indeed serves job seekers in over 60 countries and 28 languages.\n\n### Challenge: Modernize security while reducing technical debt\n\nIndeed's security team prioritizes ensuring the platform is safe for the hundreds of millions of employers and job seekers who rely on the platform, and protecting sensitive user data â€” like resumes, employment histories, and personally identifiable information â€” from leaks and theft.\n\n\"We have an obligation to be the best data stewards possible,\" explains Matthew Ortiz, senior manager of Indeed's information security, engineering, and operations teams. \"People come to us in a vulnerable state looking for a job. They entrust us with their most valuable personal data and rely on us to provide a secure, efficient environment.\"  \n\nOn top of these day-to-day security concerns, Indeed recognized the need to modernize an IT ecosystem that had grown increasingly complex. This complexity resulted in inconsistent traffic controls to the company's SaaS apps, data centers, and cloud resources. It also meant inefficient backhauling of traffic to data centers and an overreliance on traditional, perimeter-based tools like an on-premises virtual private network (VPN).\n\n\"As we grew, our technical debt grew with us,\" says Ortiz. \"We developed increasingly complex networking and security stacks which created risk and hurt productivity. We needed to simplify â€” complexity only leads to challenges and vulnerabilities.\"\n\nTo address these security and modernization goals, Indeed turned to Cloudflare's [connectivity cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/connectivity-cloud/) for secure any-to-any connectivity. In partnership with Cloudflare, Indeed began transforming its IT ecosystem, reducing complexity, improving security, and modernizing its architecture in the cloud.\n\n### Use case: Securing Indeed's job search website\n\nOne initial step towards this transformation was modernizing security for Indeed's main public-facing website. To achieve this, Indeed onboarded Cloudflare's web application firewall (WAF) and bot management capabilities to its job platform to neutralize threats and reduce fraud.\n\n\"Fraudulent job posts and employment applications represent a serious potential risk to our business, endangering users and eroding trust,\" says Ortiz, \"With the help of Cloudflare, we're able to proactively prevent and mitigate such risks to help keep the hundreds of millions of job seekers  on our platform safe.\"\n\n### Accelerating transformation by replacing a legacy VPN\n\nWithin a few months of this initial adoption, Indeed began collaborating with Cloudflare on a longer-term strategic effort to modernize connectivity and security across their workforce, including reimagining how their employees accessed resources. The first phase of this project focused on replacing Indeed's traditional VPN, which created risk and frustrated users.\n\n\"Our legacy architecture relied on implicit trust â€” meaning, employees had access to more data and resources than we wanted just by being inside an office,\" says Ortiz. \"Plus, the VPN could be slow or add friction in ways that annoyed users and made them turn off the connection, which created blind spots for us.\"\n\nTo modernize its access approach, Indeed began onboarding Cloudflare, specifically the Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) service. To evaluate the solution, Indeed rolled out Cloudflare progressively over a few weeks to dedicated test groups of hundreds of users, representing different device types and roles, including contractors. Testing helped Indeed become comfortable with how Cloudflare fit within its existing architecture and protected critical apps, developer environments, and its AWS infrastructure.\n\nIn just over 3 months, Indeed had deprecated its VPN entirely. This included migrating hundreds of preexisting access policies and rolling out Cloudflare to over 13,000 employees and contractors around the world. Today, Indeed uses the infrastructure-as-code tool Terraform to automate the vast majority of its ongoing management, including onboarding new users and configuring new policies. \n\n### ZTNA impact: Better user experiences and reduced risk\n\nThe feedback on Cloudflare's access approach has been positive. \n\n\"Compared to the VPN, our users everywhere report a much better and more consistent access experience with Cloudflare,\" says Ortiz, who specifically cited less latency and more reliable connections, especially in regions that traditionally experienced problems with the VPN.\n\nReplacing its VPN with Cloudflare helps Indeed reduce risk with Zero Trust best practices â€” meaning least-privilege, default-deny access based on context.\n\n\"Cloudflare has empowered us to be more intentional in how we grant access, enabling us to verify based on identity, device posture, location, and other variables,\" says Ortiz. \"This Zero Trust approach helps us adapt to risk and gives us way more confidence than our legacy architecture.\"\n\nIn particular, Cloudflare restores visibility for Indeed's security teams. With the VPN, the majority of users did not maintain a persistent connection, whether because of dropped service, workarounds, or other connectivity issues. Now with Cloudflare, Indeed's users stay connected for effectively all of their working hours.\n\n\"Cloudflare has helped resolve blind spots in our security and ultimately allows us to make better decisions in what access policies to set,\" says Ortiz.\n\nThe impact of replacing the legacy VPN with Cloudflare ZTNA is felt at the highest levels internally.\n\n\"Cloudflare simplifies how we deliver Zero Trust across our organization â€” that helps us mitigate risk more effectively with less effort,\" says Anthony Moisant, SVP, Indeed's Chief Information Officer, and Chief Security Officer.  \n\n### Identifying and mitigating generative AI risks\n\nThe visibility Cloudflare provides is helping Indeed reduce the risk of data leaks to AI tools. Specifically, Cloudflare is helping Ortiz and his colleagues identify which unsanctioned AI apps (known as \"shadow AI\") employees are using and establish controls when appropriate to prevent information exposure. Today, those controls include restricting access to unapproved generative AI (GenAI) tools, and over time, will include more specific detections of sensitive data via data loss prevention (DLP) scanning.\n\n\"Despite its many legitimate users, AI presents major security and privacy concerns,\" says Ortiz. \"Cloudflare helps us find what shadow AI risks exist and block unsanctioned AI apps and chatbots.\"\n\n### Future plans: Shift more security and networking to the cloud\n\nGoing forward, Indeed plans to continue simplifying its IT architecture by migrating more security controls and network connectivity to the cloud. Indeed will continue extending Zero Trust principles across environments in pursuit of what Ortiz calls the holy grail: company-wide Zero Trust. \n\nWhile the company's recent focus has been securing traffic from users to applications, one use case on the horizon includes identity-based verification for machine-to-machine workloads. In addition to simplifying access workflows, Indeed is also exploring how Cloudflare can further protect data, secure SaaS environments, and defend against threats with DLP, [cloud access security broker (CASB)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-casb/), and other [secure access service edge (SASE)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/) capabilities.\n\nReflecting on Indeed's collaboration with Cloudflare to date, Ortiz is positive.\n\n\"Cloudflare sets the standard for all the vendors we work with,\" he says. \"By reducing complexity and improving security across the board, Cloudflare is safeguarding the trust of our most important stakeholders â€” the employers and job seekers at the heart of the Indeed platform.\"",
