Manual mitigations used to stop bots only go so far before attackers adjust their techniques to evade them.  If you have questions about the amount of automated traffic your applications receive and how to address, your account team can assist.\n\n- [Credential stuffing attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-credential-stuffing/): Bots are keen on credential stuffing.  To slow them in their tracks, please turn on our exposed credential checks ruleset in the [WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/) if you have not done so yet.  We also suggest using rate limiting to throttle abuse.\n\n- [3rd party dependency risk](https://blog.cloudflare.com/page-shield-generally-available/): Attackers realize a direct way to compromise a web site is via third-party JavaScript the company doesn't own.  We suggest you gain an understanding of dependency risk by activating Page Shield Script Monitor, included for all customers.  Also please discuss additional Page Shield detections needed to secure web properties with your account team.",

We urge you to explore a [Zero Trust approach to application access](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/vpn-replacement/) that provides a more secure, faster way to connect users to corporate resources based on identity and other contextual signals.\n\n- [API security](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/api/what-is-api-security/): Roughly half the traffic we see on the Cloudflare network is API-related. We urge you to review the number of API endpoints in production and consider your process for ongoing visibility and security for OWASP API top ten attacks.\n\n- We also consider [advanced rate limiting](https://www.cloudflare.com/rate-limiting/) an important tool in protecting APIs when you match and limit traffic on API attributes like keys, cookies or tokens.\n\n- [Attack surface risks](https://blog.cloudflare.com/security-center/): as a customer, please take advantage of [Cloudflare Security Center](https://www.cloudflare.com/securitycenter/) in your dashboard.  Security Center will let you understand attack surface risks in your Cloudflare infrastructure and address them in a few clicks.",
