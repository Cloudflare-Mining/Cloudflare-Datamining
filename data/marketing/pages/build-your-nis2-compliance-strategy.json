								"shortDescription": "Porsche Informatik relies on Cloudflare to manage traffic for its brand and dealer network, protect its websites from the internet, and automate cloud migration tasks",
								"longDescription": "## __Porsche Informatik secures and automates \"Cloud Smart\" migration of over 3000 dealer websites with Cloudflare__ \n\nPorsche Informatik is a subsidiary of Europe's largest and most successful automotive distributor in Europe, [Porsche Holding Salzburg](https://www.porsche-holding.com/en), and develops groundbreaking software solutions for the mobility of the future. Its over 180 customized software solutions — serve users in 34 countries across four continents, and has been part of the Volkswagen Group since March 2011.\n\nVolkswagen Group owns some of the continent's most recognizable and prestigious automotive brands. These include Porsche and Volkswagen, Audi, Bentley, CUPRA, Lamborghini, SEAT, and ŠKODA.\n\n### __Challenge: Securing a global cloud migration__\n\nAs Porsche Holdings' full-service IT and technical services supplier, Porsche Informatik builds and maintains an international sales and support infrastructure that includes automobile dealership management, vehicle financing, distribution, and logistics planning systems.\n\nTo achieve a safe, seamless transition to the cloud, Porsche Informatik had a series of very specific goals. These included:\n\n- Securing web assets and customer domains against increasingly sophisticated malicious Internet activity\n- Ensuring resilience and high availability in the face of unstable international network conditions to promote and retain customer trust\n- Automating domain migration and SSL management processes\n- Complying with European and international data localization regulations and best practices\n\n\"With the inventory of legacy applications we have amassed over the last 20 years, Porsche Informatik wanted to ensure that both, our newer modern and our classic client-server applications, were cloud-ready,\" says Thomas Zangl, Head of Cloud and Virtualization service at Porsche Informatik. \"To do that, we needed a partner like Cloudflare to help us address our challenges, limit the dependencies in our legacy applications, and gain maximum benefits of migrating workloads from our data centers to managed services in the cloud.\" \n\n### __Establishing a partnership — Securing web applications and public access points against DDoS attacks__\n\nPorsche Informatik began its Cloudflare journey in 2022 with a series of smaller-scale tests and proofs of concept (POCs). However, with the outbreak of the Ukrainian conflict, it shifted from evaluating Cloudflare to implementing the [Cloudflare WAF and Application services](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/) and [Advanced DDoS Protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/) across all of its public websites, endpoints, and applications.\n\n\"We experienced a marked increase in malicious traffic from what appeared to be well-financed, professional groups, but Cloudflare absorbed the attacks directed towards us,\" says Zangl. \"We easily secured our public web infrastructure behind the global network's best-in-class DDoS and zero-day exploit protection.\"\n\nPorsche Informatik and Cloudflare began their enterprise partnership based on the success of this real-world trial by fire. Porsche Informatik's goal was to leverage the connectivity cloud and Cloudflare's integrated performance, developer, and application services to streamline and simplify its full-scale cloud transformation.  \n\n\"With all our public access points already safe behind Cloudflare, we decided to make everything easier to manage by consolidating security for all of our cloud-hosted workloads in using the Cloudflare ecosystem rather than a complex web of disparate technologies,\" says Zangl.\n\n### __Enhanced resilience and high availability improve the customer experience with 40% faster page loads__\n\nBecause website and application performance are key drivers of consumer confidence, improving the customer experience topped Porsche Informatik's list of transformation priorities. \n\n\"We needed to improve our resilience — to guarantee that our platforms offered optimal performance to all our users and remained available 99+% of the time,\" asserts Zangl. \"Anything less and our reputation and user trust would suffer.\" \n\nTo bolster that customer trust, Porsche Informatik began enhancing its customer experience. By transferring its web content and assets to the Cloudflare global network and leveraging   Cloudflare's 310 data centers in over 120 countries around the world, Porsche Informatik can engage with its customers at the point of service through  13,000 ISP, cloud, and enterprise network service providers.   \n\n\"Cloudflare gave us next-level content delivery services that addressed our performance issues,\" says Zangl. \"The Cloudflare network puts us closer to our customers, and provides them with the best website and customer service performance possible.\" \n\nFor Porsche Informatik's international network of customers, dealers, and service technicians the improvements were unmistakable. Augmenting the CDN using [Cloudflare Load Balancing](https://cloudflare.com/application-services/products/load-balancing/), [Argo Smart Routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/argo-smart-routing/), [Cloudflare R2 Distributed Object Storage](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/), and [Workers from the Cloudflare developer platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/workers/) to build and run applications near the end-user reduced bandwidth costs and provided massive performance and usability improvements to Porsche Informatik's online car configurator, ordering software and service queues. \n\n\"We were a global company challenged by performance bottlenecks, especially outside Europe, because we were streaming from a European server,\" says Günter Schulmeister, Porsche Informatik's Cloud Transformation Lead. \"Using Cloudflare to store and stream content on the global network, our partners in countries like Chile, Malaysia, and Japan enjoy the greatest gains — not only do they see far better website performance, they are better protected against cyber security attacks.\" \n\n\"Cloudflare reduced the loading time of our webpages by 40%,\" says Zangl. \"Having a globally distributed assets cache, using Workers to power our applications, and avoiding bottlenecks with smart routing and load balancer makes our websites faster and more reliable.\"\n\n### __Reducing bandwidth consumption by 95% and improving server performance on the global network__ \n\nCloudflare's connectivity cloud also reduces the load on Porsche Informatik's core data centers, both in the cloud and on-premises. According to Zangl, the global network now handles 95% of Porsche Informatik's public traffic. Besides the cost savings, Cloudflare frees up enough headroom on Porsche Informatik's local servers to efficiently fulfill other business objectives. \n\n\"By caching our public access content on Cloudflare we have gained the capacity to onboard new services and tolerate greater loads without over-provisioning costly bandwidth,\" says Daniel Ivanovski, Systems Engineer, Porsche Informatik. \"That improves the performance of our internal and back office applications and allows us to manage our cloud services more cost-effectively.\" \n\n### __Automating customer domain management and migration for 3000+ websites__\n\nWith all of the Porsche Holding's and the Volkswagen Group's dealer, financing, and brand websites under its care, Porsche Informatik needed to find an efficient method of maintaining DNS, managing security certificates, and migrating customer website sites into the cloud. It was a daunting task, exacerbated by the fact that most of the domains were independently owned by subsidiaries. Using Cloudflare [SSL for SaaS](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/ssl-for-saas-providers/) and the Cloudflare API, Zangl's team has streamlined the cumbersome process.\n\n\"We automate the website migration and SSL certificate maintenance process — I love it,\" says Zangl. \"Using Cloudflare API integration and an Everything as Code (EaC) approach to manage infrastructures, GitLab, and merge requests to define and delegate which websites need moving and provisioning, we have shared the burden, moving 3000 websites using customer-facing teams across the organization. Beyond making sure that changes are correct and well-documented, my people are free to focus on exploring other technologies.\"\n\nWith the sites live in the cloud, SSL for SaaS [automates the certificate management lifecycle](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/certificate-lifecycle-management/) and simplifies site maintenance and configuration, ensuring the web portfolio remains secure and up-to-date.   \n\n### __Meeting data localization and international regulatory requirements__\n\nAs an automotive commerce industry institution that both sells vehicles and provides banking services, Porsche Holding Salzburg operates in a highly regulated environment. As a result, the company's Cloud migration presented Porsche Informatik with challenges specific to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other regulatory bodies. \n\n\"We are a European company and most of our customers are in Europe, so the GDPR dictates very specifically where and how we can store corporate and user data,\" explains Schulmeister. \"Cloudflare provides its enterprise partners with the right toolset to promote GDPR compliance.\"  \n\nUsing the [Cloudflare Data Localization Suite](https://www.cloudflare.com/data-localization/), Porsche Informatik maintains rigorous, auditable control over its data, determining precisely how and where it stores, transports, and encrypts information. Cloudflare also empowers the company to establish business rules for deploying region-specific Workers to execute its serverless applications and specify the location of data centers with authorization to inspect data for threats or anomalies.   \n\n### __The Cloudflare experience__\n\nAfter working closely with Cloudflare throughout the transformation, Schulmeister expresses confidence in the partnership between the Cloudflare and Porsche Informatik teams.   \n\n\"It was like receiving first-class, white-glove service. Our enterprise partnership with Cloudflare gave us access to localization features and services, dedicated account and support teams, and Cloudflare's great solution architects,\" he says \"From the beginning, Cloudflare understood that cloud transformation is about more than simply deploying cloud services, it's also about adapting to new challenges.\" \n\n### __Moving forward__\n\nPorsche Informatik plans to continue driving innovation toward a holistic online buying and automobile ownership experience. As it advances the automotive commerce sector to align with its vision, it recognizes Cloudflare as a pivotal component of its roadmap. \n\n\"The car dealership of the future will be completely digital,\" says Zangl. \"Soon, websites or online applications will support most, if not all, of the processes in our industry. As those applications become the heart of the business, customer trust and our success depend on innovation, security, availability, scalability, and performance. Cloudflare is the partner that allows us to focus on developing those applications without worrying about outside influences.\"\nAs Porsche Informatik and its clients continue to explore use cases for enhancing their products and services with emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), the company sees Cloudflare playing a pivotal role, providing solutions where cyber security and AI intersect.\n\n\"Cloudflare is an industry leader in connectivity — it already monitors and secures a very large portion of the world's Internet traffic and few other platforms can make sense of what is happening online on such a grand scale,\" says Schulmeister. \"As we continue to innovate, Cloudflare is uniquely equipped to meet the challenge that AI presents in a way that is secure, scalable, and easily managed from a single access point.\"\n",

								"shortDescription": "Temple & Webster has deployed Cloudflare to replace legacy performance and security solutions, secure employee access and accelerate regulatory compliance.",
								"longDescription": "## __Overcoming legacy challenges: Temple & Webster choose Cloudflare for a secure, performant, and compliant network transformation__\n[\nTemple & Webster](https://www.templeandwebster.com.au/) is Australia's largest online retailer in the furniture and homewares market with over 200,000 products on offer from more than 500 suppliers, including direct sourcing capabilities through a private label division. Founded in 2011, Temple & Webster has changed the way people shop for furniture and homewares. They believe everyone wants to live more beautifully, and their vision is to make the world more beautiful, one room at a time. \n\n### __Challenge: Finding a single vendor to update content delivery and application security, while providing secure Zero Trust employee access__\n\nAs an online retailer, [Temple & Webster](https://www.templeandwebster.com.au/) is always striving to improve their website to make a memorable first impression, build their brand and drive sales.\n\n\"We create beautiful solutions and depend on beautiful imagery and galleries to help our customers find their perfect product,\" says Mike Henriques, Chief Information Officer at Temple & Webster. \"To make that happen, we have a fairly large technology team to optimise the customer experience.\"\n\nAs part of Temple & Webster's ongoing website optimisation efforts, the company wanted to replace their legacy content delivery (CDN) provider, which staff found difficult to configure and lacking in critical security capabilities.\n\n\"Our first goal was front-end optimisation. We wanted a consistent toolset to accelerate HTML and image delivery, and improve our caching,\" says Henriques. \"On the security side, we wanted to improve our WAF and bot management. As the market leader, we were conscious of the potential for high volumes of unwanted traffic on the site, but we needed more clarity than we were getting from our existing solution.\"\n\nTemple & Webster also recognised the need to modernise security for their hybrid workforce. With hundreds of employees going into offices three days per week, the IT and security teams needed to ensure consistent, high-speed and reliable protections across remote and corporate settings. Moreover, embracing best practices like Zero Trust would enable Temple & Webster to get ahead of forthcoming cybersecurity guidance and regulations from the Australian government. \n\nFinally, Temple and Webster wanted to achieve the global standard for information security management best practices, [ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) compliance. The company was looking for a centrally administered security and networking solution that would help simplify the certification process.\n\n\"With all the activity in the Australian cyber security space over the last 12 months, it was time to take a more mature, compliant approach to securing the business,\" says Henriques. \"The incumbent solution provided adequate functionality, but we knew it could not stand up over time. As our headcount and our applications grew, we needed to take better control.\"\n\n![TPW Social Image](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7KIjoAobUIRxJEWE5T8Vmd/260bc331a4c77201634fd08bc50f9eec/TPW_Social_2.jpeg)\n\n### __Solution: Out with the old — optimising performance, stopping bots, and maximising resources__\n\nTo optimise performance and [security](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) for their websites and web applications, Temple & Webster replaced their legacy vendor with Cloudflare's [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cdn/) and [WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/). From the start, Cloudflare's ease of use impressed the technology team.\n\n\"Cloudflare is very intuitive — the learning curve is negligible compared to other vendor's solutions,\" says Henriques. \n\nCloudflare improved the Temple & Webster website's performance and equipped their developers with valuable insights for further optimisation. \n\n\"Cloudflare is multiple times better than our previous CDN — load times for our static assets have gone from 50-80ms to 20-50ms,\" says Henriques. \"With Cloudflare giving us more visibility than we have ever had into optimising JavaScript, load and execution times, and application response times, we can tweak and reduce the time it takes to deliver content to the customer.\"\n\nWith Cloudflare WAF and Bot Management, Temple & Webster have also seen functional and performance improvements in website security. The SecOps teams now have far more detailed information and visibility about unwanted web activity and an automated system in place to manage defences. The result is an improved online security posture.\n\n\"From the Cloudflare dashboard, it didn't take much effort to find the right balance to defend the site against unwanted traffic while optimising the experience for our customers and valid bots,\" says Henriques. \"It is a big step up from where we were.\"\n\n### __In with the new — streamlining employee access and accelerating compliance certification with Cloudflare Zero Trust__\n\nAfter onboarding Cloudflare to protect their public-facing websites and applications, Temple & Webster saw the potential to consolidate security for their hybrid workforce on the same platform.\n\n\"We quickly discovered that Cloudflare is more of an ecosystem than a specific product set,\" says Henriques. \"The more we learn about Cloudflare capabilities, the more new use cases we plan to tackle on our roadmap.\"\n\nTemple & Webster were interested in adopting identity-based Zero Trust policies for application access and started a proof of concept with a subset of users – specifically remote employees spread across Australia, their Philippines staff, and third-party technology partners. The successful proof of concept gave Temple & Webster confidence to roll out Zero Trust access for their entire workforce. The Cloudflare platform's rapid [implementation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/how-to-implement-zero-trust/) and ease of use were the deciding factors.\n\n\"We enabled Zero Trust access to our administrative and staging environments within hours,\" says Henriques. \"From a security and performance perspective, we eliminated the risks and overheads that came with our VPN solution. That put Temple & Webster on a path to replace all our legacy access models with Cloudflare Zero Trust.\"\n\nSwitching to Cloudflare and deprecating legacy CDN, WAF, and VPN services has saved Temple & Webster significant time and resources.\n\n\"Cloudflare reduced the time our Operations and SecOps teams spent maintaining and optimising legacy software by up to  50%,\" says Henriques. \"Cloudflare self-manages. It doesn't need constant observation. I used to spend several hours each week discussing employee access and security configurations, now I spend that time on more strategic work.\"\n\nTemple & Webster find the Cloudflare platform easy to use, allowing the company to delegate ongoing administration to more junior team members. This frees up senior SecOps and Operations staff to focus on strategic priorities like strengthening regulatory compliance. \n\nCloudflare Zero Trust has had ISO/IEC 27001 certification since 2019 and the platform's robust security and data protection controls are essential to Temple & Webster's compliance strategy. \n\n\"We are on the path to compliance and, because Cloudflare Zero Trust has been so easy to implement and administer, we will achieve certification much earlier than we expected,\" says Henriques. \"Because of Cloudflare, we've shifted our thinking about network design. We're looking at unifying access management across all of our systems and applications and moving away from VPNs and entangled network rules.\"\n\nGoing forward, Temple & Webster will continue to modernise security for their hybrid workforce. The company has plans to collaborate closely with Cloudflare experts to strengthen security for their employees and customers alike.\n\n\"Cloudflare builds great products,\" says Henriques \"But, it is the support, collaboration, and deep understanding from Cloudflare's people that make things happen in hours or days rather than months.\"\n",

								"longDescription": "## __Improving PhonePe — Accelerating and securing over 3.6 billion monthly mobile payment transactions with Cloudflare__\n\nMobile payment systems are changing how the world transacts, and no country has adopted digital payments more rapidly  and on a larger scale than India. PhonePe leads that paradigm shift. \n\nWith a user base of nearly one in every four Indian citizens, PhonePe is a clear leader in the Indian digital payment space and in India's premier mobile payment platform [in every metric](https://inc42.com/buzz/phonepe-maintains-lead-in-upi-with-49-market-share-in-jan-2022-whatsapp-at-0-02/), consistently outperforming competitors. \n\n### __The Challenge: Ensuring compliant, secure, and low-latency financial transactions during daily high-traffic clusters__  \n\nScaling to meet their rapid growth — PhonePe has over 435 million registered users and processes over 3.6 billion transactions monthly. Given the scale the  company operates at, PhonePe was under pressure to provide secure, frictionless and quick service. \n\nWith their peak periods defining their network requirements, PhonePe sought a content delivery network (CDN) with the elasticity to absorb every daily traffic surge. More importantly, that solution had to handle dynamic traffic without introducing any latency that might undermine the user experience.\n\n\"Each transaction should take three seconds to complete — as that time increases, people lose patience. Once a transaction reaches 12 seconds, our users assume we are having problems, and volumes drop to zero as they turn to our competitors,\" says Burzin Engineer, PhonePe Co-founder and Chief Reliability Officer. \n\nBecause the quality of their customer experience is so significant to customer retention, PhonePe also needed a way to manage and efficiently deliver their static image and video content. \n\nNext, as a fintech platform partnering with banks, PhonePe wanted a single solution to provide real-time protection against threats like DDoS, malicious bots, and SQL injections. It also had to ensure instantaneous financial transactions on a massive scale.  \n\n\"Over 33 million merchants depend on PhonePe to fulfill their transactions, and we are under attack 24/7, 365 days a year,\" says Engineer. \"We needed the right partner and security tooling to thrive.\"\n\n### __Blocking malicious international traffic and promoting regulatory compliance with the Cloudflare WAF__  \n\nPhonePe selected Cloudflare as their [security solution](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) and content delivery partner based on a shared commitment to providing modern solutions and exceptional customer service. \n\n\"The Cloudflare tech stack interested us. Compared to the other vendors, it wasn't carrying the baggage of 20-year-old technologies,\" says Engineer. \"Cloudflare was newer and had a modern API-driven CDN purpose-built from the ground up.\"       \n\nThe company leadership was also banking on Cloudflare's commitment to developing relationships in India and improving the topology of its content delivery infrastructure nationwide.\n\nPhonePe began with the Cloudflare core security portfolio. With all of PhonePe's business conducted domestically, the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), managed rulesets, and the ability to geo-block traffic resulted in immediate security benefits. \n\n\"Using the Cloudflare WAF, we cut off more than 90% of malicious attacks by restricting traffic to sources within India,\" says Engineer. \"It gives us peace of mind to know that because everything flows through Cloudflare, we can protect our ingress and egress and keep our customers' data and money safe.\"\n\nCloudflare plays a key role in ensuring PhonePe maintains that critical uptime. Monthly, it detected and neutralized 180 million threats to the PhonePe application layer.   \n\nIn addition to protecting PhonePe's applications, Cloudflare simplifies the security auditing process and helps the platform meet its compliance requirements. The announcement that Cloudflare will [comply fully](https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/will-become-data-localization-compliant-in-india-by-decend-11661716747206.html) with India's incoming data localization and data residency requirements by the end of 2022 further eased PhonePe's regulatory needs. \n\n### __Cloudflare Workers and Stream: serverless image resizing and adaptive bitrate video delivery for a smooth, responsive user experience__\n\nWith their security and compliance concerns addressed and their applications and networks protected, PhonePe concentrated on further enhancing their user experience using Workers and the API-first Cloudflare global network.\n\nInitially, PhonePe optimized their millions of source images locally to ensure they were responsive on any device and to improve performance at the point of service. The resizing process required over 50 bare-metal origin servers — Cloudflare Workers eliminated the need for those machines. \n\n\"Once we offloaded the dynamic resizing and delivery of images for over 200 devices to Workers, all we needed to provide was a single high-resolution source image,\" explains Engineer. \"Workers resize, cache, and serve those images for us. It saves PhonePe resources, space and power. It also improves the user experience because it's faster.\"\n\nWith support from the Cloudflare engineering team, PhonePe conceived and implemented the change in under two months.\n\nAfter the success of offloading their responsive image processing to the edge, PhonePe moved on to optimizing their video content delivery. They chose Stream, the [live](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/solutions/live-streaming/) and on-demand Cloudflare video service that dynamically adapts each stream to network conditions. The Stream service proved ideal for mitigating video delivery issues caused by inconsistent mobile internet performance.\n\n\"Stream changes bitrate based on available bandwidth,\" says Engineer. \"Before we could choose from three bitrates but it was a one-time decision. Now, Stream changes rate dynamically and eliminates stall and jitter and improves our customer experience.\" \n\nUsing Workers and the Cloudflare global network, PhonePe now offloads an average of 80% of the traffic from their origin servers and enjoys corresponding savings in bandwidth and a 10x reduction in infrastructure costs. In a month, Cloudflare serves 775 billion requests for PhonePe — over 289,000 requests per second and their merchant notifications and image resizing use cases trigger 50 billion Workers requests.\n\nFor PhonePe, where network and security issues directly affect their customers and merchant partners, proactive Cloudflare support translates to peace of mind. \n\n\"It is comforting to have Cloudflare to tell us exactly what is happening, why it happened, and how the support team is coming together to fix it,\" says Engineer. \"While no company can guarantee perfection, how they react to problems shows you their true character, and Cloudflare's character is impeccable.\"\n",
