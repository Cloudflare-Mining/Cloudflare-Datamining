This presents the possibility for missing critical health notifications across potentially many pools and origins! These missed notifications can result in the larger infrastructure being affected and serving large amounts of errors to end-users, in turn, tarnishing the user experience.\n\nTo solve this, we introduced Monitor Preview. With Preview, users can make changes to their monitor details and preview the results across all the pools the particular monitor is attached to, all before deploying the changes. This means as our customers continue to build more complex infrastructure on Cloudflare, they have the tools to drive confidence around any edits/changes they make to their monitor configurations ahead of deploying those changes. This not only ensures users configurations are correct across their varying pools, but protects them from any unwanted surprises and makes sure that application reliability is maximised.",

Functions will allow a customer to have better control and flexibility to evaluate attributes.

The negative impact of this is it makes security more challenging. These functions will disable case sensitivity for that field, and you can now evaluate in either UPPER case or lower case. This does not change the actual request, it purely changes the case during the evaluation of the attribute. For examples and documentation please see the developer docs.",

For example, customers may configure \"origin.customer.com\" to reach their origin instead of an A record like 198.41.214.162.\n\nBefore this change, every single request to our edge would trigger a DNS lookup for an origin IP. This behavior is particularly problematic if a CNAME is configured as the origin. In this case, we could add 100s of milliseconds in latency, since we may need multiple Internet requests to fetch the origin IP. Now, we  only look up the origin IP when we need it. This cuts the total number of DNS requests in half and reduces the total time we spent looking up DNS records by about 1/3rd globally.\n",
