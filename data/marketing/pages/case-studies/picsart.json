As PicsArt grew and expanded, serving content from a single location could mean slow delivery and congested infrastructure, which would result in a poor experience for PicsArt's users. With that in mind, PicsArt set out to find a solution before it became an issue.\n\n__PicsArt's Solution: Content Distribution with Built-in Optimization and Protection__\n\nPicsArt knew that a Content Distribution Network (CDN) would solve their challenge and allow for seamless growth going forwards. Cloudflare's CDN now caches and serves PicsArt's content from data servers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world reducing geographic latency for PicsArt's global users, while also saving PicsArt Bandwidth. \"With Cloudflare's CDN the load time of our images improved by 2-3x and on top of that we're saving over 50% on our monthly bandwidth usage,\" noted Vardanyan.\n\n## *\"With Cloudflare's CDN the load time of our images improved by 2-3x and on top of that we're saving over 50% on our monthly bandwidth usage\"*\n\nThough PicsArt was only searching for a performance partner, they also saw the benefits of enlisting Cloudflare's security and protection. \"In the last month Cloudflare blocked over 675 million threats aimed at our infrastructure,\" Vardanyan explained. Cloudflare's protection is multi-fold: the Web Application Firewall (WAF) leverages collective security intelligence from millions of Internet properties on the network to protect PicsArt from the latest known vulnerabilities and malicious actors. Furthermore, Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation is designed to allow normal traffic to freely flow, while blocking and absorbing malicious traffic at Cloudflare's edge. This allows PicsArt to stay online and functioning for their users, even in the case of a massive online attack.\n\nVardanyan concluded: \"We chose Cloudflare because they are the best CDN provider for our business and scaling needs, with continuous innovation, new services and great support.\"",
