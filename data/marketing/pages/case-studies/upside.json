Our business is about making our customers' lives easier, so we can't have them dealing with the headache of a breached account.\"\n\nOutside of security, Upside was also looking to optimize their application's performance. \"Speed is a huge priority for us,\" commented Oar, \"we recently executed a site overhaul to make it faster, and we are always looking for areas to continue to optimize the speed of our site, as this helps us get and retain customers.\"\n\n__Upside's Solution: Powerful Rate Limiting and Simplified Deployment__\n\nUpside's existing user-facing tools gave them the basic security and performance they needed, but it had its limitations. \"With our previous solutions, domain names were tightly coupled with the CDN distribution they are running through,\" explained Gorrell. \"With a microservices environment like ours, DNS and deployments need to be easily shuffled around without customer disruption. It's a frustrating and tedious process to accomplish that with the tight coupling.\" While looking for a new vendor, Upside found most solutions for this issue to be overly complicated or too intrusive. The team decided on Cloudflare because it offered ease-of-use, scalability, flexible DNS management, granular Rate Limiting controls, security through the Web Application Firewall (WAF), and CDN.\n\n\"Cloudflare had a lot of features out-of-the-box that solved a number of problems for us,\" Gorrell began. \"Rate Limiting and reputation-based IP scoring help us block the threats we were seeing. By switching to Cloudflare's CDN, we were able simplify our deployment patterns because the CDN is always available, rather than being a coupled unit of deployment attached to a DNS name.\"\n\nWith Cloudflare, Upside has seen a significant drop in attacks, and is able to block the attempts that continue to occur. By leveraging Cloudflare's performance network, Upside has also improved the load times of its pages.",
