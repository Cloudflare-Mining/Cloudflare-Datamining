For a small company like us, that's not feasible.\"\n\n__CrazyGames's Solution: A Global Network Built for Performance and Security__\n\nCrazyGames turned Cloudflare for global content delivery and security. Today, CrazyGames uses Cloudflare's CDN (Content Delivery Network) to cache and serve content from data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world and bolsters site security with Cloudflare's WAF and DDoS mitigation. \"Switching to Cloudflare allowed us to lower our bill, improve the performance of our site, and simplify our infrastructure stack,\" Mertens explained. Cloudflare's CDN saves CrazyGames over 40TB of bandwidth every month.",
