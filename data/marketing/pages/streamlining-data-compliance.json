								"shortDescription": "Temple & Webster has deployed Cloudflare to replace legacy performance and security solutions, secure employee access and accelerate regulatory compliance.",
								"longDescription": "## __Overcoming legacy challenges: Temple & Webster choose Cloudflare for a secure, performant, and compliant network transformation__\n[\nTemple & Webster](https://www.templeandwebster.com.au/) is Australia's largest online retailer in the furniture and homewares market with over 200,000 products on offer from more than 500 suppliers, including direct sourcing capabilities through a private label division. Founded in 2011, Temple & Webster has changed the way people shop for furniture and homewares. They believe everyone wants to live more beautifully, and their vision is to make the world more beautiful, one room at a time. \n\n### __Challenge: Finding a single vendor to update content delivery and application security, while providing secure Zero Trust employee access__\n\nAs an online retailer, [Temple & Webster](https://www.templeandwebster.com.au/) is always striving to improve their website to make a memorable first impression, build their brand and drive sales.\n\n\"We create beautiful solutions and depend on beautiful imagery and galleries to help our customers find their perfect product,\" says Mike Henriques, Chief Information Officer at Temple & Webster. \"To make that happen, we have a fairly large technology team to optimise the customer experience.\"\n\nAs part of Temple & Webster's ongoing website optimisation efforts, the company wanted to replace their legacy content delivery (CDN) provider, which staff found difficult to configure and lacking in critical security capabilities.\n\n\"Our first goal was front-end optimisation. We wanted a consistent toolset to accelerate HTML and image delivery, and improve our caching,\" says Henriques. \"On the security side, we wanted to improve our WAF and bot management. As the market leader, we were conscious of the potential for high volumes of unwanted traffic on the site, but we needed more clarity than we were getting from our existing solution.\"\n\nTemple & Webster also recognised the need to modernise security for their hybrid workforce. With hundreds of employees going into offices three days per week, the IT and security teams needed to ensure consistent, high-speed and reliable protections across remote and corporate settings. Moreover, embracing best practices like Zero Trust would enable Temple & Webster to get ahead of forthcoming cybersecurity guidance and regulations from the Australian government. \n\nFinally, Temple and Webster wanted to achieve the global standard for information security management best practices, [ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) compliance. The company was looking for a centrally administered security and networking solution that would help simplify the certification process.\n\n\"With all the activity in the Australian cyber security space over the last 12 months, it was time to take a more mature, compliant approach to securing the business,\" says Henriques. \"The incumbent solution provided adequate functionality, but we knew it could not stand up over time. As our headcount and our applications grew, we needed to take better control.\"\n\n![TPW Social Image](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7KIjoAobUIRxJEWE5T8Vmd/260bc331a4c77201634fd08bc50f9eec/TPW_Social_2.jpeg)\n\n### __Solution: Out with the old — optimising performance, stopping bots, and maximising resources__\n\nTo optimise performance and [security](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) for their websites and web applications, Temple & Webster replaced their legacy vendor with Cloudflare's [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/) and [WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/). From the start, Cloudflare's ease of use impressed the technology team.\n\n\"Cloudflare is very intuitive — the learning curve is negligible compared to other vendor's solutions,\" says Henriques. \n\nCloudflare improved the Temple & Webster website's performance and equipped their developers with valuable insights for further optimisation. \n\n\"Cloudflare is multiple times better than our previous CDN — load times for our static assets have gone from 50-80ms to 20-50ms,\" says Henriques. \"With Cloudflare giving us more visibility than we have ever had into optimising JavaScript, load and execution times, and application response times, we can tweak and reduce the time it takes to deliver content to the customer.\"\n\nWith Cloudflare WAF and Bot Management, Temple & Webster have also seen functional and performance improvements in website security. The SecOps teams now have far more detailed information and visibility about unwanted web activity and an automated system in place to manage defences. The result is an improved online security posture.\n\n\"From the Cloudflare dashboard, it didn't take much effort to find the right balance to defend the site against unwanted traffic while optimising the experience for our customers and valid bots,\" says Henriques. \"It is a big step up from where we were.\"\n\n### __In with the new — streamlining employee access and accelerating compliance certification with Cloudflare Zero Trust__\n\nAfter onboarding Cloudflare to protect their public-facing websites and applications, Temple & Webster saw the potential to consolidate security for their hybrid workforce on the same platform.\n\n\"We quickly discovered that Cloudflare is more of an ecosystem than a specific product set,\" says Henriques. \"The more we learn about Cloudflare capabilities, the more new use cases we plan to tackle on our roadmap.\"\n\nTemple & Webster were interested in adopting identity-based Zero Trust policies for application access and started a proof of concept with a subset of users – specifically remote employees spread across Australia, their Philippines staff, and third-party technology partners. The successful proof of concept gave Temple & Webster confidence to roll out Zero Trust access for their entire workforce. The Cloudflare platform's rapid [implementation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/how-to-implement-zero-trust/) and ease of use were the deciding factors.\n\n\"We enabled Zero Trust access to our administrative and staging environments within hours,\" says Henriques. \"From a security and performance perspective, we eliminated the risks and overheads that came with our VPN solution. That put Temple & Webster on a path to replace all our legacy access models with Cloudflare Zero Trust.\"\n\nSwitching to Cloudflare and deprecating legacy CDN, WAF, and VPN services has saved Temple & Webster significant time and resources.\n\n\"Cloudflare reduced the time our Operations and SecOps teams spent maintaining and optimising legacy software by up to  50%,\" says Henriques. \"Cloudflare self-manages. It doesn't need constant observation. I used to spend several hours each week discussing employee access and security configurations, now I spend that time on more strategic work.\"\n\nTemple & Webster find the Cloudflare platform easy to use, allowing the company to delegate ongoing administration to more junior team members. This frees up senior SecOps and Operations staff to focus on strategic priorities like strengthening regulatory compliance. \n\nCloudflare Zero Trust has had ISO/IEC 27001 certification since 2019 and the platform's robust security and data protection controls are essential to Temple & Webster's compliance strategy. \n\n\"We are on the path to compliance and, because Cloudflare Zero Trust has been so easy to implement and administer, we will achieve certification much earlier than we expected,\" says Henriques. \"Because of Cloudflare, we've shifted our thinking about network design. We're looking at unifying access management across all of our systems and applications and moving away from VPNs and entangled network rules.\"\n\nGoing forward, Temple & Webster will continue to modernise security for their hybrid workforce. The company has plans to collaborate closely with Cloudflare experts to strengthen security for their employees and customers alike.\n\n\"Cloudflare builds great products,\" says Henriques \"But, it is the support, collaboration, and deep understanding from Cloudflare's people that make things happen in hours or days rather than months.\"\n",

That's why [Flo Health](https://flo.health/), the leading women's health app, has made security and privacy core to the company's mission — and why it chose Cloudflare to provide an extra layer of protection.\n\nFlo is the #1 most popular female health app worldwide, with 250 million total installs and 50 million monthly active users. Security and privacy are paramount to Flo's core values because its app deals with deeply personal issues like fertility tracking, reproductive goals, and even preemptive disease detection. \n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"At Flo, we firmly believe that every woman deserves the right to track their health without concern. It is the responsibility of every women's health app to commit to high privacy and security standards, and thanks to Cloudflare's suite of products, we are able to offer a deeper level of protection for our users' data.\"</b></center>\n<center><i>-Roman Bugaev</center>\n  <center>Chief Technology Officer, Flo</i></center>\n</br>\n\nTo bolster its security on the network layer, Flo turned to Cloudflare. Flo now has deep insights into the traffic attempting to reach its servers — informed by the vast scale of Cloudflare's network, operating across %{DataCenterCount} cities in %{CountryCount} countries worldwide. \n\nTools like Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall and Rate Limiting allow Flo to automatically block malicious traffic flagged by the collective intelligence of Cloudflare's network — informed by over %{GlobalWebsiteCountWords} million Cloudflare customers' Internet properties. These insights allow Cloudflare to create proprietary WAF rulesets that account for 84.6% of application-layer threats blocked by Cloudflare, resulting in major security gains over the standard OWASP firewall Core Rule Set. And Flo can also deploy its own fine-grained, custom rules to suit its needs. \n\nFlo Health also took advantage of [Cloudflare's integration with CrowdStrike](https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners/crowdstrike/endpoint-partners/) to ensure that its employees had secure access to applications from anywhere. Using both product sets, Flo could easily deploy custom rules based on Crowdstrike's ZTA score to ensure only employees with the right device posture got access to sensitive applications. Employees with low ZTA score were either denied access or put in a sandbox enviornment.\n\nIn addition to Cloudflare's security suite, Flo is leveraging Cloudflare to reach a premium subscriber audience with exclusive video content served by Cloudflare Stream. Stream gives Flo a way to manage and deliver video at scale with full control, including a Flo-branded video player. This experience has proven so compelling that Flo's fans are watching 10 times more video than they were with their previous provider, totaling over 14.5 million minutes watched per month. \n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Cloudflare has helped us ensure app reliability and 30% faster response time across all regions. No matter where our users are located — Flo works smoothly on their smartphones thanks to smart traffic routing, and content in the app is now delivered to the user from the closest Cloudflare server.</b></center>\n<p></p>\n<center><b>What is even more important, the partnership with Cloudflare helps us to raise the bar of security standards for women's health apps, which is absolutely essential for our category. Our users entrust us with their most sensitive data and we are committed to taking every step to ensure that it is protected. Cloudflare provides the solution that enables our app to combat any potential DDoS attacks thanks to layered security approach and multiple DDoS mitigation capabilities.\"</b></center>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>-Roman Bugaev</center>\n  <center>Chief Technology Officer, Flo</i></center>\n</br>",

								"longDescription": "## __Improving PhonePe — Accelerating and securing over 3.6 billion monthly mobile payment transactions with Cloudflare__\n\nMobile payment systems are changing how the world transacts, and no country has adopted digital payments more rapidly  and on a larger scale than India. PhonePe leads that paradigm shift. \n\nWith a user base of nearly one in every four Indian citizens, PhonePe is a clear leader in the Indian digital payment space and in India's premier mobile payment platform [in every metric](https://inc42.com/buzz/phonepe-maintains-lead-in-upi-with-49-market-share-in-jan-2022-whatsapp-at-0-02/), consistently outperforming competitors. \n\n### __The Challenge: Ensuring compliant, secure, and low-latency financial transactions during daily high-traffic clusters__  \n\nScaling to meet their rapid growth — PhonePe has over 435 million registered users and processes over 3.6 billion transactions monthly. Given the scale the  company operates at, PhonePe was under pressure to provide secure, frictionless and quick service. \n\nWith their peak periods defining their network requirements, PhonePe sought a content delivery network (CDN) with the elasticity to absorb every daily traffic surge. More importantly, that solution had to handle dynamic traffic without introducing any latency that might undermine the user experience.\n\n\"Each transaction should take three seconds to complete — as that time increases, people lose patience. Once a transaction reaches 12 seconds, our users assume we are having problems, and volumes drop to zero as they turn to our competitors,\" says Burzin Engineer, PhonePe Co-founder and Chief Reliability Officer. \n\nBecause the quality of their customer experience is so significant to customer retention, PhonePe also needed a way to manage and efficiently deliver their static image and video content. \n\nNext, as a fintech platform partnering with banks, PhonePe wanted a single solution to provide real-time protection against threats like DDoS, malicious bots, and SQL injections. It also had to ensure instantaneous financial transactions on a massive scale.  \n\n\"Over 33 million merchants depend on PhonePe to fulfill their transactions, and we are under attack 24/7, 365 days a year,\" says Engineer. \"We needed the right partner and security tooling to thrive.\"\n\n### __Blocking malicious international traffic and promoting regulatory compliance with the Cloudflare WAF__  \n\nPhonePe selected Cloudflare as their [security solution](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) and content delivery partner based on a shared commitment to providing modern solutions and exceptional customer service. \n\n\"The Cloudflare tech stack interested us. Compared to the other vendors, it wasn't carrying the baggage of 20-year-old technologies,\" says Engineer. \"Cloudflare was newer and had a modern API-driven CDN purpose-built from the ground up.\"       \n\nThe company leadership was also banking on Cloudflare's commitment to developing relationships in India and improving the topology of its content delivery infrastructure nationwide.\n\nPhonePe began with the Cloudflare core security portfolio. With all of PhonePe's business conducted domestically, the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), managed rulesets, and the ability to geo-block traffic resulted in immediate security benefits. \n\n\"Using the Cloudflare WAF, we cut off more than 90% of malicious attacks by restricting traffic to sources within India,\" says Engineer. \"It gives us peace of mind to know that because everything flows through Cloudflare, we can protect our ingress and egress and keep our customers' data and money safe.\"\n\nCloudflare plays a key role in ensuring PhonePe maintains that critical uptime. Monthly, it detected and neutralized 180 million threats to the PhonePe application layer.   \n\nIn addition to protecting PhonePe's applications, Cloudflare simplifies the security auditing process and helps the platform meet its compliance requirements. The announcement that Cloudflare will [comply fully](https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/will-become-data-localization-compliant-in-india-by-decend-11661716747206.html) with India's incoming data localization and data residency requirements by the end of 2022 further eased PhonePe's regulatory needs. \n\n### __Cloudflare Workers and Stream: serverless image resizing and adaptive bitrate video delivery for a smooth, responsive user experience__\n\nWith their security and compliance concerns addressed and their applications and networks protected, PhonePe concentrated on further enhancing their user experience using Workers and the API-first Cloudflare global network.\n\nInitially, PhonePe optimized their millions of source images locally to ensure they were responsive on any device and to improve performance at the point of service. The resizing process required over 50 bare-metal origin servers — Cloudflare Workers eliminated the need for those machines. \n\n\"Once we offloaded the dynamic resizing and delivery of images for over 200 devices to Workers, all we needed to provide was a single high-resolution source image,\" explains Engineer. \"Workers resize, cache, and serve those images for us. It saves PhonePe resources, space and power. It also improves the user experience because it's faster.\"\n\nWith support from the Cloudflare engineering team, PhonePe conceived and implemented the change in under two months.\n\nAfter the success of offloading their responsive image processing to the edge, PhonePe moved on to optimizing their video content delivery. They chose Stream, the [live](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/solutions/live-streaming/) and on-demand Cloudflare video service that dynamically adapts each stream to network conditions. The Stream service proved ideal for mitigating video delivery issues caused by inconsistent mobile internet performance.\n\n\"Stream changes bitrate based on available bandwidth,\" says Engineer. \"Before we could choose from three bitrates but it was a one-time decision. Now, Stream changes rate dynamically and eliminates stall and jitter and improves our customer experience.\" \n\nUsing Workers and the Cloudflare global network, PhonePe now offloads an average of 80% of the traffic from their origin servers and enjoys corresponding savings in bandwidth and a 10x reduction in infrastructure costs. In a month, Cloudflare serves 775 billion requests for PhonePe — over 289,000 requests per second and their merchant notifications and image resizing use cases trigger 50 billion Workers requests.\n\nFor PhonePe, where network and security issues directly affect their customers and merchant partners, proactive Cloudflare support translates to peace of mind. \n\n\"It is comforting to have Cloudflare to tell us exactly what is happening, why it happened, and how the support team is coming together to fix it,\" says Engineer. \"While no company can guarantee perfection, how they react to problems shows you their true character, and Cloudflare's character is impeccable.\"\n",
