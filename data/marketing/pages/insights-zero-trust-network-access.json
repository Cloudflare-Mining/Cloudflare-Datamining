A VPN works by establishing encrypted connections to protect assets and manage user access to an internal network. All devices that connect to the VPN are set up with encryption keys, and these keys are used to encode and decode all information sent between them and the network access server. This process adds a small amount of latency to network connections that will slow down network traffic.",

Employees are required to use a separate set of credentials to log on to devices, which can interrupt workflows. Connecting to applications is slow, reducing efficiency and when the VPN is down, work comes to an abrupt halt. Users experience performance degradation and latency if a VPN is located far away from the user and the server the user is trying to access. For instance, if a user in San Francisco is trying to access a website on a server in the same city, but the VPN service is in Japan, the user's request has to travel halfway around the world and back before connecting to the local server. In the case of a cloud-based VPN, the network access server sits in a different data center than a company's internal network. This extra step can add additional latency to every single request between users and the network.",
