Algorithm 13 is a variant of the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/\">Elliptic Curve Digital Signing Algorithm</a> (ECDSA). While currently used by less than 0.01% of domains, we'd like to argue that ECDSA helped us eliminate the final two barriers for widespread DNSSEC adoption: zone enumeration and DDoS amplification.\n\nZone enumeration is prevented by live signing, and this is only computationally efficient with the fast signature generation of ECDSA. Elliptic curves also produce significantly smaller keys and signatures than their RSA counterparts, which means responses to DNS queries are smaller. This greatly reduces the amplification factor of DNS-based DDoS attacks.",
