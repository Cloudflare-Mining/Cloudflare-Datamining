However, the root DNS zone has no parent, so how can we trust the integrity and authenticity of its information?\n\n<img class=\"responsive-image-pad-center\" title=\"official ceremony photo\" alt=\"official ceremony photo\" src=\"/img/products/official-ceremony-photo.jpg\">\n<p class=\"text--italic\"> Photo courtesy of IANA </p>\n\nThat’s the purpose of the Root Signing Ceremony—a rigorous procedure around signing the root DNS zone’s public keying information for the next few months. The private signing key used in this process is quite literally the key to the entire DNSSEC-protected Internet. A public, audited, and tightly controlled ceremony around accessing this key is a necessity for DNSSEC to succeed as a global standard.\n\nÓlafur Guðmundsson, an engineering manager at Cloudflare and Crypto Officer at ICANN, participated in the ceremony this August.

So, the first step is to poll the Crypto Officers to find a two-day window when 4-5 of them can attend. We usually try to find a period where more than the minimum three are available, as emergencies or travel problems can cause a ceremony cancellation.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe last ceremony took place on August 13th at the El Segundo facility. To get into the facility, I had to show a government issued ID and show the contents of my bag. In return, I got an ID strip attached to my shirt. Then, I waited for an ICANN staffer to escort me inside. To get through the door, he had to swipe an access card and place his hand on a scanner.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe first stop was a conference room where lunch was being served. We mingled there while waiting for the rest of the ceremony participants to arrive. Being Crypto Officers, most of the small talk revolved around trying to steal root-signing key. We figured it would only take a half hour or so to blast a hole in the wall and walk out with the safe; however, that would probably trip the seismic sensors, so we would know that the key was compromised.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce everybody showed up, we were escorted to the ceremony room in small groups as the entrance room only holds about 8 people. In this room we sign a log before we are allowed into the main key ceremony room. To access the entrance room, an ICANN staff member needs to use a smart card; to enter the main room a retina scan is needed of said staffer.\n</p>",

These safes store all of the sensitive material used during the ceremony. The cage can only be entered in the presence of the Ceremony Administrator and an Internal Witness. This is enforced by a second retina scan and access cards from both the Ceremony Administrator and Internal Witness.\n</p>\n<img class=\"responsive-image-pad-center\" title=\"diagram a guy walks into a room with two safes\" alt=\"diagram a guy walks into a room with two safes\" src=\"/img/products/dns/dnssec/diagram-a-guy-walks-into-a-room-with-two-safes.svg\">\n<p>\nHowever, neither the Ceremony Administrator or Internal Witness can actually open the safes. For that, we need the Safe Controllers\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"marketing-h3\">The Credentials Safe</h3>\n<p>\nThe Credentials Safe Controller opens the first safe, and inside we find several safe deposit boxes, each requiring two keys. The Ceremony Administrator has one of those keys, and each of the Crypto Officers has a key to a different box. Together (and in the presence of the Internal Witness and Credentials Safe Controller), the Ceremony Administrator and the Crypto Officers open three safe deposit boxes.\n</p>\n<img class=\"responsive-image-pad-center\" title=\"diagram the credentials safe\" alt=\"diagram the credentials safe\" src=\"/img/products/dns/dnssec/diagram-the-credentials-safe.svg\">\n<p>\nEach safe deposit box contains an operator card and a security permissions card for the Hardware Security Module (HSM), which we’ll discuss in the next section. Three operator cards are required to unlock the HSM, which is why three Crypto Officers must attend the ceremony. The security permissions cards are only used when we need to transfer the root-signing key, so we usually leave those in the safe deposit box.\n</p>\n<p>\nBoth cards are stored inside plastic cases wrapped in tamper-evident bags (most of the ceremony revolves around detecting foul-play, if you couldn’t tell already). These cards stay in the safe when not in use, which means the last time someone touched them was at the previous Root Signing Ceremony. The tamper-evident bags help ensure that they haven’t been altered in the interim.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe plastic cases are also very important, as someone discovered that it was possible to manipulate the cards by poking needles through the tamper evident bag, which would not necessarily be noticeable when inspecting the bag. This is a good example of how the security procedures around the ceremony are constantly evolving.\n</p>\n<img class=\"responsive-image-pad-center\" title=\"tamper evident bag\" alt=\"tamper evident bag\" src=\"/img/products/tamper-evident-bag.jpg\">",

The HSM is a physical computing device designed specifically for working with sensitive cryptographic material. You can think of it as a digital lock-box for the root-signing key. It can only be accessed with the three operator cards that we collected from the credentials safe.\n</p>\n<img class=\"responsive-image-pad-center\" title=\"diagram the hardware safe\" alt=\"diagram the hardware safe\" src=\"/img/products/dns/dnssec/diagram-the-hardware-safe.svg\">\n<p>\nThe HSM can’t be operated without an external interface, so the hardware safe also contains a special laptop that can send commands to the HSM. This laptop has no battery, hard disk, or even a clock backup battery, and thus can’t store state once it’s unplugged. The goal is to eliminate any possibility of the root-signing key leaving the HSM after the ceremony ends.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe now have the hardware to perform the Root Signing Ceremony. Notice that the presence of all 7 participants is required to physically access the materials for the ceremony. Again, the idea is to minimize the risk of malicious conspirators by separating access to the HSM from access to the operator cards that activate the HSM.\n</p>\n<p>\nA USB containing logs from each of the prior ceremonies and a DVD used to boot the laptop (both in their own tamper-evident bags) are also removed from this safe.\n</p>",

All of the equipment is laid out on a table in full view of all those attending, as well as the camera used to audit the proceedings.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne by one, each of the three Crypto Officers is called up to the table and asked to hand over the HSM operator card they took out of their safe deposit box. Before doing so, they verify that the tamper-evident bag is in the same condition as when they placed it in the safe deposit box at the end of the previous ceremony. Once they hand it over, only the Ceremony Administrator is allowed to touch the card.\n</p>\n<img class=\"responsive-image-pad-center\" title=\"diagram equipment setup\" alt=\"diagram equipment setup\" src=\"/img/products/dns/dnssec/diagram-equipment-setup.svg\">\n<p>\nThe Ceremony Administrator boots the laptop from a DVD and initializes the USB that records the ceremony logs. Remember that the laptop has no clock battery backup, which means the time needs to be set manually from a special wall clock in the ceremony room. It’s the same clock used since the first ceremony five years ago, and it’s completely isolated from the rest of the world. It’s drifted slightly, but that’s fine, as it’s only used for logging purposes.\n</p>\n<img class=\"responsive-image-pad-center\" title=\"Root signing ceremony\" alt=\"Root signing ceremony\" src=\"/img/products/ceremony-table.jpg\">\n<p class=\"text--italic\">Ceremony table, before equipment setup</p>\n<p>\nNext, the Ceremony Administrator needs to activate the HSM by placing the three operator cards collected from the Crypto Officers into the machine.

The only way to move information from the outside world into the laptop/HSM is via USB drive. Accordingly, the key-signing request is loaded into the laptop via USB. To ensure that the correct key is being signed, a PGP hash of the key-signing request is computed, and Verisign verifies that it is identical to the one they provided.\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, the Ceremony Administrator can sign the KSR with the private key-signing key. He enters “Y” on a command prompt, and the dramatic portion of the ceremony is complete. The result is a collection of digital signatures, otherwise known in DNSSEC as the RRSIG record, which we’ll explore in a moment.\n</p>\n<p>\nNote that the KSR actually contains a bundle of zone-signing keys that are rotated out every 15-16 days. There are enough keys in the bundle to last until the next Root Signing Ceremony three months from now.\n</p>",
