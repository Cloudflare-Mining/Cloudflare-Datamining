[Learn more](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2022/cloudflare-completes-acquisition-of-area-1-security/). \n\n**Redwood City, Calif., October 13, 2020** –  Area 1 Security, the first and only preemptive, cloud-native email security provider, is proud to be recognized as a Representative Vendor for Integrated Email Security Solutions in Gartner's 2020 Market Guide for Email Security. To view the full guide compliments of Area 1 Security, click here.\n\nWhen it comes to growing adoption of cloud email and collaboration tools, the report notes \"a growing trend of supplementing the built-in security tools with additional API-based solutions as well as traditional security email gateway solutions.\" The report also states that \"Security and risk management leaders must revisit their organizations' email security architecture in the light of current email threats, such as sophisticated malware, links to exploit kits, credential phishing and BEC.\"\n\nTo help address these trends and other email security risks, the report's recommendations include investing in \"anti-phishing technology that can accurately detect BEC and account takeover attacks\"; seeking \"solutions that use computer vision when reviewing suspect URLs for account takeover attacks\"; addressing \"gaps in the advanced threat defense capabilities of an incumbent secure email gateway (SEG) by either replacing them or supplementing them with complementary capabilities via API integration\"; integrating \"email events into a broader XDR or SIEM/SOAR strategy,\" and more.\n\n\"We think the Market Guide is valuable because it helps reiterate the pain points that we hear from CISOs and channel partners every day: phish keep bypassing customers' SEGs and cloud email, they can't identify BEC fraud, and they need more resources for their SOC team,\" said Patrick Sweeney, president and CEO of Area 1 Security. \"We believe being named by Gartner as a Representative Vendor validates our strategy to solve these challenges with a preemptive, comprehensive, API-first email security approach.\"\n\nAs the report points out, \"Email threats have become sophisticated to evade detection by common email security technologies, particularly those that rely only on standard antivirus and reputation.\"\n\nArea 1 Security can help organizations address all categories for email security products:\n\n- To Protect Against Attachment-Based Advanced Threats\n- To Protect Against URL-Based Advanced Threats\n- To Protect Against Impersonation and Social Engineering Tactics Used in URL-Based, Attachment-Based and Payloadless Advanced Threats\n- Additional Differentiating Capabilities\n\nTo assess your phishing and BEC risks as part of an email security gap analysis, request a free Phishing Risk Assessment from Area 1.
