With these integrations, Cloudflare customers also using these generative AI applications will be able to strengthen enterprise AI security – in-real time and without the need for complex set ups. \n\nGenerative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Google's Gemini are changing how businesses work. Today, [three out of every four](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part/) employees use generative AI tools – for tasks ranging from editing content and summarizing data to helping with design tasks and debugging code. At the same time, enterprises are working to keep sensitive corporate data safe, prevent accidental leaks, and maintain compliance with evolving regulations. This requires real-time visibility and proactive  controls for security teams to safely enable generative AI use across their business.\n\n\"Employees are always looking for an edge – ways to save time, spark creativity, or boost efficiency. Using Generative AI tools gives them that edge,\" said Matthew Prince, CEO and co-founder at Cloudflare. \"But there is often a missing link between rapid innovation and safety. Cloudflare has already introduced a number of safeguards to help businesses embrace AI, and now, we're the only company that has built integrations directly into all three of the most popular tools to raise the bar on enterprise AI security for the whole industry.\" \n\nWith these new integrations, customers have a new way to manage enterprise AI security as more employees use generative AI tools. Cloudflare's CASB continuously scans ChatGPT Enterprise, Claude, and Google's Gemini platforms to better protect customers' sensitive data through automated and real-time visibility and proactive alerts. This ultimately gives security teams greater control and confidence that company data remains compliant and protected while employees use AI tools.\n\nTo learn more, please check out the resources below:\n- [Cloudflare Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/casb/)\n- Blog: [ChatGPT, Claude, & Gemini security scanning with Cloudflare CASB\n](https://blog.cloudflare.com/casb-ai-integrations)\n\n__About Cloudflare__ \n\nCloudflare, Inc.
