The collaboration expands TD SYNNEX's portfolio of solutions to include Cloudflare's Zero Trust, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), Application Security, and Network Security solutions in Latin America, creating new routes to market for Managed Security Services Partners (MSSPs).\n\nBusinesses across Latin America are facing hybrid work environment complexities alongside dynamic threat landscapes. In the most recent first quarter of 2025 alone, Cloudflare blocked an average of 30 billion cyber threats in Latin America every single day, up 27 percent from the previous quarter. Organizations are looking to acquire complete threat protection and operational performance, yet are struggling to manage the costs and complexities associated with multiple vendor solutions pieced together. On the other side, partners are seeking to build out comprehensive practices with clear revenue streams. In contrast to learning and implementing four or five different platforms to deliver a full tech stack, a MSSP can now leverage Cloudflare's full [connectivity cloud services platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/connectivity-cloud/). \n\nThe Cloudflare platform is available in a single interface making it simple for MSSPs to deploy and manage their customer's security solutions with operational efficiency. Cloudflare autonomously blocks threats across the region with its global infrastructure network, which is one of the largest and most interconnected in the world, today spanning 64 cities in Latin America and the Caribbean. Customers adopting the entire Cloudflare suite are able to save about 50 percent over what they were spending versus trying to cobble together numerous, different solutions. In addition, a Cloudflare commissioned [Forrester Consulting Total Economic Impact™ study](https://www.cloudflare.com/es-la/lp/forrester-tei-study-2024/) focused on a composite organization representative of interviewed customers using Cloudflare, found that they achieved a 238% ROI over three years, from broad use of the Cloudflare platform.\n\n\"Cloudflare is the only company now offering a broad range of application services, network services, and SASE services on our own network through a single platform to MSSPs,\" said Tom Evans, Chief Partner Officer at Cloudflare. \"Partners are fundamental to extending critical security protections with operational efficiency and we are thrilled to be growing our partnership with TD SYNNEX to deliver managed services in Latin America.\"\n\n\"The demand for managed security services is accelerating in Latin American countries with prominent market domination of SMBs and small enterprises. We see local organizations having dozens of different cybersecurity vendors and this brings more complexities and costs, putting cybersecurity management at risk,\" said Carlos Torales, Vice President of Latin America at Cloudflare. \"With TD SYNNEX, Cloudflare's connectivity cloud platform can now bridge the gap for MSSPs to have highly efficient operations and robust cybersecurity all while controlling operational costs.\" \n\n\"As cyber threats become more sophisticated, the demand for advanced managed security services continues to surge,\" said Marcos Murata, Vice President, Vendor Management and Business Strategy for TD SYNNEX in Latin America. \"Integrating Cloudflare's security suite into our portfolio empowers our MSSP partners in LAC with a ready-to-deploy security stack that reduces complexity, accelerates time-to-market, and enables flexible delivery. With our strong sales and technical enablement capabilities, we're helping partners deliver cost-effective solutions tailored to the region's unique needs. Together, we're not just elevating cybersecurity — we are building a more resilient and secure digital ecosystem.\"\n\nCloudflare and TD SYNNEX have been partnering since 2021. The latest MSSP expansion in Latin America extends Cloudflare's connectivity cloud platform in a single unified interface while TD Synnex equips partners with the comprehensive cloud-native security services and program enablement.
