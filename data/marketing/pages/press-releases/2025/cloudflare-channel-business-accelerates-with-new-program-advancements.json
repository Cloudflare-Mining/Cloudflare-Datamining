				"body": "San Francisco, CA, October 13, 2025 – [Cloudflare, Inc.](https://www.cloudflare.com/) (NYSE: NET), the leading connectivity cloud company, today announced the acceleration of its channel business with new solution bundles across its platform for partners. The newly launched bundles enable Cloudflare's PowerUP Partner Program partners to help businesses better secure and manage their applications through a single platform with tailored bundles—eliminating the complexity from multiple solutions. \n\nToday, organizations are using more applications and AI workloads in an effort to make their business faster and more productive. However, this digital sprawl also means there are more applications that need to be managed and secured. Traditionally, partners have been tasked with identifying and managing solutions for only select areas of a business, without visibility across all of the various applications they may be using. To better protect their entire organization, companies need partners that can deliver a consolidated approach to securing their entire environment—not just specific applications or business areas.\n\nCloudflare's PowerUP Partner Program now offers solution bundles to equip partners with the tools to eliminate application complexity, reduce cyber risk, enable connectivity between multiple clouds, and cut costs. The new solution bundles also provide substantial discounts for partners, dependent on the partner level and solutions. Each bundle is tailored to give any customer a clear path to adopt networking and security with SASE and applications services at-scale.\n\n\"Partners are at the core of Cloudflare's go-to-market strategy. This past year we have introduced innovative tools, launched impactful incentives, and expanded enablement to help our partners equip more businesses with the security, performance, and reliability of Cloudflare's connectivity cloud platform,\" said Tom Evans, Chief Partner Officer at Cloudflare. \"Partners are actively turning to us to help customers consolidate at-scale. Now, our new solution bundles will help them capitalize on this opportunity.\" \n\n__PowerUP Partner Testimonials__\n\nCloudflare continues to expand its strategic partnerships across Global Service Integrators, Managed Security Service Providers, Resellers, and Distributors; such as with [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud), [Kyndryl](https://www.kyndryl.com/us/en), [Rakuten Mobile](https://network.mobile.rakuten.co.jp/en/), [GuidePoint Security](https://www.guidepointsecurity.com/), and [Presidio](https://www.presidio.com/), among other leading organizations worldwide. \n\n\"Both IBM and Cloudflare share a commitment to equip businesses with security, reliability, and speed across their Internet properties,\" said Nataraj Nagaratnam, IBM Fellow, CTO, AI Security and Architecture. \"Together, with IBM Cloud Internet Services powered by Cloudflare, we have been delivering solutions to enterprises worldwide, including large banks and insurance companies.

The result is an intelligent,  more resilient, and cost-efficient modern networking foundation for innovation and growth.\"\n\n\"Rakuten Mobile and Cloudflare partnered together this year in April, creating a first of its kind enhanced security service for corporate clients in Japan as Cloudflare's first MSSP partner in the country, supporting corporate zero-trust security\", said Kazuhiro Suzuki, Co-CEO of Rakuten Mobile. \"By combining Cloudflare's connectivity cloud platform of solutions with our managed services, we've been empowering our clients' digital transformation with a one-stop solution for network and security for corporate clients across all sectors in Japan.\"\n\n\"GuidePoint Security is a trusted advisor to many of the world's leading organizations.
