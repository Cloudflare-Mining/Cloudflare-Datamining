Making its debut on the list, Cloudflare is recognized for helping ensure cyber attacks did not play a role in impacting the outcome of the 2024 United States elections. Throughout the year, Cloudflare played a critical role in securing the nation from cyber attacks, protecting political candidates, and providing its services at no cost to hundreds of government websites for more than half of U.S. states. \n\nThe fifth-annual Most Influential Companies distinction by TIME celebrates the visionaries and change-makers shaping the world today, recognizing companies making extraordinary impacts around the world. This past year, Cloudflare played a vital role in upholding the nation's democratic process. As the entire world watched the United States closely, Cloudflare rose to the occasion, aiding U.S. presidential candidates, election officials, and political campaigns up and down the ballot. The company defended the United States elections from cyber threats, protecting candidates and local governments that were targeted by cyber attacks, and prevented disruption. \n\n\"As we all watched the U.S. elections unfold, I'm proud that Cloudflare helped ensure cyber attacks did not play a role in impacting the U.S. 2024 elections. For the last eight years, Cloudflare has been guarding governments, and democracy, with the highest level of protection,\" said Matthew Prince, Co-founder and CEO at Cloudflare. \"We're honored to be recognized as a TIME100 Most Influential Company—a testament to our team's impact and role in keeping campaigns and election officials safeguarded online. Cloudflare's mission is to help build a better Internet—one that the world increasingly depends on, both in critical moments like these, and in everyday life.\"\n\nIn addition to political campaigns, ongoing state and local elections and resources—which are critical components of the nation's democracy—also require protection.
