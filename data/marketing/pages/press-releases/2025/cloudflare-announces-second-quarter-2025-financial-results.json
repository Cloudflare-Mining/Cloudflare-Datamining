We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for  internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively,  may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance.  However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations  as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in  accordance with U.S. GAAP. In particular, free cash flow is not a substitute for cash provided by operating activities.  Additionally, the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the  total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. In addition, other companies, including companies  in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate  their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for  comparison. A reconciliation is provided above for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly  comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related  U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly  comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. \n\n__Items Excluded from Non-GAAP Measures.__ We exclude stock-based compensation expense, which is a  non cash  expense, from certain of our  non-GAAP  financial measures because we believe that excluding this item  provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. We exclude employer payroll tax  expenses related to stock-based compensation, which is a cash expense, from certain of our non-GAAP financial  measures because such expenses are dependent on the price of our Class A common stock and other factors that  are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of our business. We exclude amortization of acquired  intangible assets, which is a  non-cash  expense, related to business combinations from certain of our  non GAAP  financial measures because such expenses are related to business combinations and have no direct  correlation to the operation of our business. We exclude acquisition-related and other expenses from certain of our  non-GAAP financial measures because such expenses are related to business combinations and have no direct  correlation to the operation of our business. Acquisition-related and other expenses can be cash or non-cash  expenses and include third-party transaction costs and compensation expense for key acquired personnel. We  exclude lease impairment charges related to real estate leases, which is a non-cash expense, from certain of our  non-GAAP financial measures because they are not indicative of the Company's ongoing cost structure and core  business performance. We exclude amortization of debt issuance costs, which is a non-cash expense, from certain  of our  non-GAAP  financial measures because such expenses have no direct correlation to the operation of our  business. We also excluded the one-time cash compensation charge incurred during the three months ended March  31, 2024 from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because it was not attributable to services provided and  did not correlate to the ongoing operation of our business. \n\n__Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin.__ We define non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross  margin as U.S. GAAP gross profit and U.S. GAAP gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation  and related employer payroll taxes and amortization of acquired intangible assets. \n\n__Non-GAAP Income from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin.__ We define  non-GAAP  income from  operations and  non-GAAP  operating margin as U.S. GAAP loss from operations and U.S. GAAP operating margin,  respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense and its related employer payroll taxes, amortization of  acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related and other expenses, and lease impairment charges. \n\n__Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income per Share, Diluted.__ We define non-GAAP net income as GAAP  net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation expense and its related employer payroll taxes, amortization of  acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related and other expenses, amortization of issuance costs, lease impairment  charges, and a non-GAAP provision for (benefit from) income taxes. Generally, the difference between our GAAP and  non-GAAP income tax expense (benefit) is primarily due to adjustments in stock-based compensation and related  employer payroll taxes, amortization of acquired intangibles associated with business combinations, acquisition \nrelated and other expenses, amortization of issuance costs, and lease impairment charges. We define non-GAAP net  income per share, diluted, as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding,  adjusted for dilutive potential shares that were assumed outstanding during period. Currently, potential dilutive  effect mainly consists of employee equity incentive plans and convertible senior notes. We believe that excluding  these items from non-GAAP net income per share, diluted, provides management and investors with greater visibility  into the underlying performance of our core business operating results.\n\n__Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin.__ Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as  net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized  internal-use software. Free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. We believe that free  cash flow and free cash flow margin are useful indicators of liquidity that provide information to management and  investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after the investments in property and  equipment and capitalized internal-use software, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in our  business, and strengthening our financial position. We believe that historical and future trends in free cash flow and  free cash flow margin, even if negative, provide useful information about the amount of cash generated by our  operating activities that is available (or not available) to be used for strategic initiatives. For example, if free cash  flow is negative, we may need to access cash reserves or other sources of capital to invest in strategic initiatives.  One limitation of free cash flow and free cash flow margin is that they do not reflect our future contractual  commitments. Additionally, free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a  given period.\n",
