Now, organizations can see all of their technology in a single dashboard, understand the potential threats and provide immediate actions to reduce their risk quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe average enterprise today [uses](https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/reports/salesforce-state-of-it-3rd-edition-v2.pdf) more than a thousand applications to do everything from helping employees communicate across email and chat tools, managing customer experience and human resources processes, to building new products and more. As organizations have adopted these new tools and applications to fuel innovation, they have simultaneously introduced significant levels of complexity across their IT infrastructure– leaving gaps and creating ample opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit. \n\nNow, with Cloudflare Security Posture Management, customers gain an unprecedented view into the potential threats to their organization. This new comprehensive view helps by providing: \n- __An at-a-glance snapshot of an organization's security posture__: Regardless of the applications used by an organization, Cloudflare Security Posture Management actively scans for potential risks or misconfigurations that could cause harm–generating quick insights for teams to review and take action. \n- __Protection for the SaaS applications that hold sensitive information__: From intellectual property, personal information, financials and more, SaaS applications host an organization's most vital information. But it's often challenging to secure these applications if they don't have built in security controls. Starting today, Cloudflare provides a central place to manage these applications and allow users to automatically identify risks in real-time from common issues like externally shared files, unknown or anonymous user access, or databases with exposed credentials and more.\n- __Always on threat detection for web assets__: Web applications are a prime target due to widespread use and a treasure trove of valuable data within. Because of this, hackers continuously try new methods to find and exploit vulnerabilities in popular web applications. Use-case driven threat detections, tailored to protect each individual specific business function, allows organizations to better prepare and keep up with the ever changing attack landscape. A combination of attack-focused and business functionality-led defenses forms a multi-layer shield against threats to critical web applications.\n\n\"Every security team knows that you can't secure what you don't know is there,\" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO at Cloudflare. \"We want to give our customers an edge by making it as simple as possible to identify critical applications and data, and stop threats quickly–with the least amount of effort. Cloudflare's Security Posture Management helps customers safeguard their applications, acting as one of the most essential pieces to making sure their business–and the Internet–stays secure.\"\n\nTo learn more, please check out the resources below:\n- Blog: [One platform to manage your company's predictive security posture with Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-security-posture-management)\n- [Cloudflare API Shield](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/api-gateway/)\n- [Cloudflare CASB](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/casb/)\n\n__About Cloudflare__ \n\nCloudflare, Inc.
