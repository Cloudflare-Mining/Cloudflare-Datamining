				"body": "San Francisco, California —October 13, 2025 — [Cloudflare, Inc.](https://www.cloudflare.com/) (NYSE: NET), the leading connectivity cloud company, today announced that its connectivity cloud platform will be available natively on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for customers worldwide. This will enable joint customers to leverage Cloudflare's security, performance, and resiliency directly from OCI across hybrid, multicloud, and OCI hosted applications.  \n\nRecently, a Forrester Research report found that 73% of enterprise networking infrastructure and telecommunications decision-makers said that their firms were adopting multicloud networking. These environments enable organizations to easily mix and match the best features from different cloud providers, but managing and securing them often involves complex, resource-intensive, manual configurations. In addition, as organizations adopt AI applications and workloads at an increasing rate, their cloud environments are getting even more complex, making it more important than ever to have visibility, control, and protection over all their applications. \n\n\"We all see how AI is transforming the way organizations and their employees operate, and we need to pay equal attention to how AI is expanding our threat landscapes,\" said Tom Evans, Chief Partner Officer at Cloudflare. \"Organizations need a comprehensive platform that delivers flexibility, performance, and security. Our integration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will help ensure businesses everywhere, across any cloud environment, can run their workloads on a unified platform with security and speed at the forefront.\"\n\n\"At Oracle, we are committed to helping our customers run their most critical workloads securely, reliably, and at scale,\" said David Hicks, Group Vice President, ISV Ecosystem, Oracle North America. \"Through our partnership with Cloudflare, we will enable organizations to protect cloud and AI workloads while enhancing resilience and performance across hybrid and multicloud environments. Together, we will give businesses the confidence to innovate and grow, knowing their applications and data are protected every step of the way.\"\n\nCloudflare runs one of the largest and most interconnected networks in the world, with its connectivity cloud platform delivering global Internet security, speed, and reliability for a wide range of organizations, including startups, enterprises, and governments. With Oracle and Cloudflare, organizations can benefit from a complete solution to secure their applications, enable innovation across cloud environments, and optimize end-user application performance and security. \n\nCloudflare and Oracle customers can:\n- __Accelerate public-facing applications and AI inference:__ Reduce latency worldwide with industry-leading performance.\n\n- __Strengthen AI security:__ Shield workloads with DDoS protection, WAF, bot mitigation, and Zero Trust controls.\n\n- __Enable hybrid and multi-cloud architectures:__ Securely connect and orchestrate traffic across hybrid and multi-cloud environments with unified control.\n\n- __Protect APIs:__ Safeguard their entire vendor ecosystem with rate limiting, threat intelligence, and data protection. \n\n- __Address compliance across digital environments:__ Address enterprise compliance requirements as a globally distributed, security-first platform with Cloudflare.\n\n[Cloudflare and Oracle will be on-stage at Cloudflare Connect](https://events.cloudflare.com/connect/2025/#agenda), Cloudflare's user conference in Las Vegas, to discuss the new integration in-depth.
