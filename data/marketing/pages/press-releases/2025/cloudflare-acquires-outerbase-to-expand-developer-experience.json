With this acquisition, building database-backed applications will be more approachable — enabling more teams to build and deploy full-stack, AI-enabled applications on Cloudflare's global network.\n\nDatabases are key to building any modern application. And, with the rapid growth of AI and AI agents, more software will be built over the next five years than in the past 20. Almost all of those applications will need a database to maintain context, store conversations, and act on data. Ensuring that those databases can be built and managed quickly, easily, and at scale by developers of all backgrounds will help more developers to build those applications on Cloudflare. \n\n\"Businesses are racing to build AI-powered applications to be as productive, innovative, and competitive as possible. Our goal is to make it easy and accessible for any developer, regardless of expertise, to build database-backed applications that can scale,\" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. \"Outerbase's technology and design expertise are an important factor in accelerating this improved developer experience.\"  \n\nOuterbase itself is built on Cloudflare Workers, making it easy for the technology to rapidly be incorporated directly into [Durable Objects](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/durable-objects/), [D1](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/d1/) and Cloudflare's [Agents SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/) to provide easy to use interfaces and frameworks to interact with data and build database-dependent applications. With this acquisition, Cloudflare aims to democratize data access and make it easier for teams to manage databases without extensive SQL knowledge. \n\n \"At Outerbase, our mission has always been to make working with data easier for developers. Joining Cloudflare allows us to keep doing that, but faster and at a much larger scale,\" said Brandon Strittmatter, co-founder and CEO of Outerbase. \"We've built Outerbase on top of Cloudflare, so this next step feels natural. Now, we get to take what we've built and make it part of the platform itself. I'm beyond excited about this opportunity — not just because of what it means for the team, but how as part of Cloudflare, we will shape the way people are building developer tools and AI applications.\"\n\nTo learn more, please check out the resources below:\n\n* **Blog**: [Cloudflare acquires Outerbase to expand database and agent developer experience capabilities](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-acquires-outerbase-database-dx)\n* [Learn more about Durable Objects](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/durable-objects/) \n\n**About Cloudflare** \n\nCloudflare, Inc.
