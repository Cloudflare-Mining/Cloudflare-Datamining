Based on telemetry from Cloudflare's massive global network, Cloudforce One's threat events platform helps security teams get more done with the same resources by spotting issues faster, responding to threats quickly and staying one step ahead of how cybercriminals operate and what systems they target. \n\nEvery day, cybercriminals change tactics, finding new vulnerabilities to exploit and ways to overwhelm their victims. What's more, cybercrime costs are [projected](https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/#:~:text=Cybersecurity%20Ventures%20expects%20global%20cybercrime,%243%20trillion%20USD%20in%202015.) to reach $10.5 trillion in 2025. For organizations to keep up, they need to understand the threat landscape they face. However, traditional threat intelligence feeds often lack meaningful or complete context for why a threat event was placed on the feed–similar to getting a warning without an explanation or path to resolution. Optimal [threat intelligence](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-threat-intelligence/) feeds need to cut through the noise to deliver specific, actionable information about cybercriminals, emerging risks, and [indicators of compromise (IoCs)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-are-indicators-of-compromise/) that directly impact an organization's security posture.\n\n\"Not all threat feeds are reliable or timely. The industry is plagued by insights that are stale or fragmented, significantly increasing organizations' chances of falling victim to hackers,\" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO, Cloudflare. \"Cloudflare has built one of the world's largest global networks, which positions us to be one of the only companies that has access to the most complete and accurate threat intelligence. Our unique robust visibility makes our threat events platform the most comprehensive option to move the needle.\"\n\nBuilt on [Cloudflare Workers AI](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/workers-ai/), the threat events platform is designed to both scale and maintain resiliency during surges in data that reflect the unpredictable nature of attacks on the Internet. Starting today, the Cloudforce One threat events platform can help organizations:\n- __Gain a single view of the constant attack stream across the Internet__: Now, organizations will have access to an attacker timelapse view powered by threat insights no one else has, designed to answer strategic questions and drill down into the details of an attack. This approach ensures that users have access to the most relevant information at their fingertips.\n- __Take action against today's sophisticated threat actors__: Security teams can tap into personalized information for a specific environment, industry or region. Threat events provide users with actionable IoCs and event summaries, including the associated threat actor group, with profiles that break down methods and map tactics.\n- __Boost efficiency and reaction speed of security teams__: Threat events provide valuable context around the data gathered, allowing security teams to prioritize activity and focus limited resources on the most pressing threats. Businesses can significantly improve their threat intelligence ecosystem and overall security posture by routing and integrating the right threat intelligence into cybersecurity tools. \n\n\"Organizations need actionable threat intelligence to understand the scale of threats they are up against, and how the aggression and techniques of hackers are evolving,\" said Blake Darché, Head of Cloudforce One, Cloudflare. \"Most industry tools flood security teams with threat intelligence that's irrelevant, often leading to false positives and/or negatives. Cloudforce One's threat events platform keeps customers focused on the most pressing threats to their direct environment, from trivial risks up through complex use cases like the exploitation of CVEs or insider threats.\" \n\nTo learn more, please check out the resources below:\n- Blog: [Unleashing improved context for threat actor activity with our threat events platform](http://blog.cloudflare.com/threat-events-platform)\n- Cloudforce One: [Threat events platform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/cloudforce-one/#analyze-threat-events)\n\n__About Cloudflare__ \n\nCloudflare, Inc.
