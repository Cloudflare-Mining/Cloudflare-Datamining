Cloudflare's SASE offering addresses both security and networking transformation requirements without adding complexity, a crucial differentiator in protecting today's hybrid workforce. \n\nAs organizations migrate to the cloud to accelerate innovation and maintain a competitive edge, they often grapple with network complexity, along with the need to connect and secure distributed employees, devices, apps, and data centers — all without sacrificing performance. Without a flexible IT infrastructure, organizations face issues such as security gaps from distributed users and personal devices, which introduces significant risk to corporate data and increases overall cost. To combat this, organizations are drastically shifting to adopt single-vendor SASE platforms. According to Gartner®, \"by 2026, 60% of new SD-WAN purchases will be part of a single-vendor SASE offering, up from 15% in 2023.\" Cloudflare One allows customers to adopt SASE as it fits their existing deployments including native single-vendor deployments with Cloudflare, or by leveraging existing SD-WAN deployments. Cloudflare's branch appliance, Magic WAN Connector, can be pre-installed on hardware delivered by [TD SYNNEX](https://www.tdsynnex.com/na/us/), a leading global distributor and solutions aggregator for the IT ecosystem, or installed within organizations' existing environments. \n\nEvery day, enterprise technology leaders bring together thousands of people, devices, clouds, systems, applications, and networks to support a new business imperative: the digital imperative, to work, develop, and deliver everything everywhere. Cloudflare's branch appliance and networking-as-a-service, are built natively upon Cloudflare's [connectivity cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/connectivity-cloud/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DG_NAMER_NA_ENG_G_Search_Brand_Alpha_Umbrella_Connectivity-Cloud&utm_content=Alpha_Brand_Umbrella_Connectivity-Cloud&utm_term=Cloudflare+Cloud&campaignid=71700000114890438&adgroupid=58700008553151176&creativeid=675097792680&&_bt=675097792680&_bk=cloudflare%20cloud&_bm=b&_bn=g&_bg=157520608241&_placement=&_target=&_loc=9067609&_dv=c&awsearchcpc=1&gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpc-oBhCGARIsAH6ote_B5y49Rh30CuXb_34sfccGfHh7Mzl6ebr5kPENz_2FgnzPpZdLe5QaArWQEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), which simplifies deployment for enterprises and improves: \n- __Network and security staff efficiency:__ Cloudflare One reduces the time it takes to connect users, locations, and devices by centralizing policy management and enforcement around the globe.\n- __Security posture:__ Cloudflare One reduces the customer's attack surface, while also reducing operational complexity with a single dashboard control plane.\n- __Administrator and user experience:__ Cloudflare One is built on its unified connectivity cloud, massively improving performance for in-office, remote, or hybrid workers. This is backed by Cloudflare's 100% uptime SLA to guarantee business continuity for enterprises.\n- __Control over IT environments:__ Cloudflare One enables IT leaders to operate in domains they once could not exercise control over, by connecting any traffic source or destination and layering Zero Trust security policies on top. \n\n\"For over a decade, Cloudflare has been in the business of simplifying network security. Whether it's securely connecting remote employees, offices, data centers, or even multi-cloud deployment, we empower IT teams with the means necessary to modernize their architecture,\" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. \"The GA of Magic WAN Connector on Cloudflare One represents our ability to enable business productivity that is secure at speed, from one of the most comprehensive SASE solutions available today.\"\n\n\"TD SYNNEX is committed to uniting IT solutions that deliver business outcomes today and unlock growth for the future. With Cloudflare's latest solution added to TD SYNNEX's global portfolio, we're able to further enrich the breadth and depth of our security offerings.
