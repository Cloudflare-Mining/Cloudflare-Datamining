Cloudflare `HTMLRewriter` packaged to work with

-   Node.js (reading the wasm from file system)
-   Next.js (appending `?module` to wasm imports)
-   browser (fetching the wasm file at runtime)
-   Deno (fetching the wasm file at runtime with file:// protocol)
-   Bun & Cloudflare (simply using the global `HTMLRewriter` object)

## Install

```
npm i htmlrewriter
```

```ts
import { HTMLRewriter } from 'htmlrewriter'

const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter()

rewriter.on('a', {

        element.setAttribute('href', 'https://www.baidu.com')
    },
})
const res = rewriter.transform(
    new Response('<a href="https://www.google.com">google</a>'),
)
console.log(await res.text())
