`@cloudflare/speedtest` is a JavaScript module to measure the quality of a clientâ€™s Internet connection. It's the measurement engine that powers the Cloudflare speedtest measurement application available at [https://speed.cloudflare.com](https://speed.cloudflare.com).

The module performs test requests against the [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) edge network and relies on the [PerformanceResourceTiming browser api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming) to extract timing results.
The network connection is characterized by items such as download/upload bandwidth, latency and packet loss.

Please note that measurement results are collected by Cloudflare on completion for the purpose of calculating aggregated insights regarding Internet connection quality.

**Warning:** The public TURN server for Packet Loss testing is deprecated and will be discontinued soon. Read the [packetLoss](#packetloss) section for more information.

## Installation

Add this package to your `package.json` by running this in the root of your project's directory:

```sh
npm install @cloudflare/speedtest
```

## Simple Usage

```js
import SpeedTest from '@cloudflare/speedtest';

new SpeedTest().onFinish = results => console.log(results.getSummary());
```

## API reference

`SpeedTest` is a JavaScript Class and should be instantiated with the `new` keyword. It's not required to pass a config object, as all items have default values.

### Measurement config

The specific measurements to be performed by the test engine (and their sequence) can be customized using the `measurements` config option. This should be an array of objects, each with a `type` field, plus additional fields specific to that measurement type.

The default set of measurements that is performed by the engine is:

```js
[
  { type: 'latency', numPackets: 1 }, // initial latency estimation
  { type: 'download', bytes: 1e5, count: 1, bypassMinDuration: true }, // initial download estimation
  { type: 'latency', numPackets: 20 },
  { type: 'download', bytes: 1e5, count: 9 },
  { type: 'download', bytes: 1e6, count: 8 },
  { type: 'upload', bytes: 1e5, count: 8 },
  { type: 'packetLoss', numPackets: 1e3, responsesWaitTime: 3000 },
  { type: 'upload', bytes: 1e6, count: 6 },
  { type: 'download', bytes: 1e7, count: 6 },
  { type: 'upload', bytes: 1e7, count: 4 },
  { type: 'download', bytes: 2.5e7, count: 4 },
  { type: 'upload', bytes: 2.5e7, count: 4 },
  { type: 'download', bytes: 1e8, count: 3 },
  { type: 'upload', bytes: 5e7, count: 3 },
  { type: 'download', bytes: 2.5e8, count: 2 }
]
```

Here are the fields available per measurement type:

#### latency

| Field | Required | Description | Default |
| --- | :--: | --- | :--: |
| **numPackets**: *number* | yes | The number of latency GET requests to perform. These requests are performed against the download API with `bytes=0`, and then the round-trip time-to-first-byte timing between `requestStart` and `responseStart` is extracted. | - |

#### download / upload

Each of these measurement sets are bound to a specific file size. The engine follows a ramp-up methodology per direction (download or upload). Whenever there are multiple measurement sets (with increasing file sizes) for a direction, the engine will keep on performing them until it reaches the condition specified by `bandwidthMinRequestDuration`, at which point further sets in the same direction are ignored.

| Field | Required | Description | Default |
| --- | :--: | --- | :--: |
| **bytes**: *number* | yes | The file size to request from the download API, or post to the upload API. The bandwidth (calculated as bits per second, or bps) for each request is calculated by dividing the `transferSize` (in bits) by the request duration (excluding the server processing time). | - |
| **count**: *number* | yes | The number of requests to perform for this file size. | - |
| **bypassMinDuration**: *boolean* | no | Whether the `bandwidthMinRequestDuration` check should be ignored, and the engine is instructed to proceed with the measurements of this direction in any case. | `false` |

#### packetLoss

Packet loss is measured by submitting a set of UDP packets to a WebRTC TURN server in a round-trip fashion, and determining how many packets do not arrive. The submission of these packets can be done in a batching method, in which there's a sleep time in between batches.

**Note:** You must provide your own TURN server configuration if you'd like to get packet loss results from this engine.

Example code to enable this feature through a Cloudflare Worker, using a [Cloudflare Realtime TURN server](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/turn/), is available at [example/turn-worker](example/turn-worker). Refer to the worker's [documentation](example/turn-worker/README.md) for setup and deployment instructions.

| Field | Required | Description | Default |
| --- | :--: | --- | :--: |
| **numPackets**: *number* | no | The total number of UDP packets to send. | 100 |
| **responsesWaitTime**: *number* | no | The interval of time (in milliseconds) to wait after the latest packet reception before determining the measurement as complete, and all non-returned packets as lost. | 5000 |
| **batchSize**: *number* | no | The number of packets in a batch. If this value is higher than `numPackets` there will be only one batch. | 10 |
| **batchWaitTime**: *number* | no | How long to wait (in milliseconds) between batches. | 10 |
| **connectionTimeout**: *number* | no | Timeout for the connection to the TURN server. | 5000 |
