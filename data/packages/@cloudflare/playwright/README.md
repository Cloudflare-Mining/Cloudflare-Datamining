# Playwright for Browser Rendering

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/playwright/tree/main/packages/playwright-cloudflare/examples/todomvc)

Fork of [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/) that was modified to be compatible with [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) and [Browser Rendering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/).

## Getting Started

Create a [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/_)

```Shell
npm create cloudflare@latest -- cf-playwright-worker
```

## Installation

This package is released on npmjs.com at [@cloudflare/playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/playwright). To install it in your project:

```Shell
npm i -s @cloudflare/playwright
```

## Configuration

ðŸ“„ **Place this in `wrangler.toml`**

```toml
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
browser = { binding = "MYBROWSER" }
```

## Example

You can find a full running example here [Cloudflare Playwright running example](https://github.com/cloudflare/playwright/tree/main/packages/playwright-cloudflare/examples/todomvc)

### Screenshot

```js
import { launch } from '@cloudflare/playwright';

export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    const browser = await launch(env.MYBROWSER);
    const page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.goto('https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc');

    const TODO_ITEMS = [
        'buy some cheese',
        'feed the cat',
        'book a doctors appointment'
    ];

    const newTodo = page.getByPlaceholder('What needs to be done?');
    for (const item of TODO_ITEMS) {
        await newTodo.fill(item);
        await newTodo.press('Enter');
    }

    const img = await page.screenshot();
    await browser.close();

    return new Response(img, {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'image/png',
        },
    });
  }
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

### Trace

```js
import { launch } from "@cloudflare/playwright";
import fs from "@cloudflare/playwright/fs";

export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    const browser = await launch(env.MYBROWSER);
    const page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.context().tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true });

    // ... do something, screenshot for example

    await page.context().tracing.stop({ path: "trace.zip" });
    await browser.close();
    const file = await fs.promises.readFile("trace.zip");

    return new Response(file, {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/zip",
      },
    });
  }
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

### Assertions

```js
import { launch } from "@cloudflare/playwright";
import { expect } from "@cloudflare/playwright/test";

export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    const browser = await launch(env.MYBROWSER);
    const page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.goto("https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc");

    const TODO_ITEMS = [
      "buy some cheese",
      "feed the cat",
      "book a doctors appointment",
    ];

    const newTodo = page.getByPlaceholder("What needs to be done?");
    for (const item of TODO_ITEMS) {
      await newTodo.fill(item);
      await newTodo.press("Enter");
    }

    await expect(page.getByTestId("todo-title")).toHaveCount(TODO_ITEMS.length);

    await Promise.all(
      TODO_ITEMS.map((value, index) =>
        expect(page.getByTestId("todo-title").nth(index)).toHaveText(value)
      )
    );
  }
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## ðŸš§ Currently Unsupported Features

The following capabilities are not yet fully supported, but weâ€™re actively working on them.

- [API Testing](https://playwright.dev/docs/api-testing)
- [Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration) except [Assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions)
- [Components](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components)
- [Firefox](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright#playwright-firefox), [Android](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-android) and [Electron](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-electron), as well as different versions of Chrome
