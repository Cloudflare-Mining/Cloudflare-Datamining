- [#221](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/pull/221) [`3aba9e8`](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/commit/3aba9e8da6e2e6acd7b40076cc0920a69cb02775) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add OpenAI Agents adapters

  Add OpenAI Agents adapters (`Shell` and `Editor`) that integrate Cloudflare Sandbox with the OpenAI Agents SDK. These adapters enable AI agents to execute shell commands and perform file operations (create, update, delete) inside sandboxed environments. Both adapters automatically collect and timestamp results from operations, making it easy to track command execution and file modifications during agent sessions. The adapters are exported from `@cloudflare/sandbox/openai` and implement the OpenAI Agents `Shell` and `Editor` interfaces.

### Patch Changes

- [#190](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/pull/190) [`57d764c`](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/commit/57d764c2f01ca3ed93fd3d3244a50e8262405e1b) Thanks [@ghostwriternr](https://github.com/ghostwriternr)! - Add S3-compatible bucket mounting

  Enable mounting S3-compatible buckets (R2, S3, GCS, MinIO, etc.) as local filesystem paths using s3fs-fuse. Supports automatic credential detection from environment variables and intelligent provider detection from endpoint URLs.

- [#223](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/pull/223) [`b1a86c8`](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/commit/b1a86c89285ebcae36ee9bb2f68f7765265e4504) Thanks [@ghostwriternr](https://github.com/ghostwriternr)! - Improve container startup resiliency

  SDK now retries both 503 (provisioning) and 500 (startup failure) errors automatically. Container timeouts increased to 30s instance + 90s ports (was 8s + 20s).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#213](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/pull/213) [`8503265`](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/commit/8503265d2491a1f8e1fc1ab2f9cf7f9f0baef34b) Thanks [@ghostwriternr](https://github.com/ghostwriternr)! - Add opt-in `normalizeId` option to `getSandbox()` for preview URL compatibility.

  Sandbox IDs with uppercase letters cause preview URL requests to route to different Durable Object instances (hostnames are case-insensitive). Use `{ normalizeId: true }` to lowercase IDs for preview URL support:

  ```typescript
  getSandbox(ns, 'MyProject-123', { normalizeId: true }); // Creates DO with key "myproject-123"
  ```

  **Important:** Different `normalizeId` values create different DO instances. If you have an existing sandbox with uppercase letters, create a new one with `normalizeId: true`.

  **Deprecation warning:** IDs with uppercase letters will trigger a warning. In a future version, `normalizeId` will default to `true`.

  Remove @cloudflare/vite-plugin from root devDependencies to avoid turbo prune bug with nested optionalDependencies. The vite-plugin is only used by examples which are excluded from Docker builds and already have it in their own package.json.

### Patch Changes

- [`228ef5b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/commit/228ef5b6e57fa3c38dc8d90e006ae58d0815aaec) Thanks [@ghostwriternr](https://github.com/ghostwriternr)! - Fix encoding parameter handling in file operations to enable MIME auto-detection. Previously, SDK and container handlers added default 'utf8' encoding, preventing MIME-based detection of binary files. Now encoding parameter is passed through as-is, allowing automatic detection when not explicitly specified.

  This adds a new `exists()` method to the SDK that checks whether a file or directory exists at a given path. The method returns a boolean indicating existence, similar to Python's `os.path.exists()` and JavaScript's `fs.existsSync()`.

  The implementation is end-to-end:
  - New `FileExistsResult` and `FileExistsRequest` types in shared package
  - Handler endpoint at `/api/exists` in container layer
  - Client method in `FileClient` and `Sandbox` classes
  - Full test coverage (unit tests and E2E tests)

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#59](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/pull/59) [`b6757f7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/commit/b6757f730c34381d5a70d513944bbf9840f598ab) Thanks [@ghostwriternr](https://github.com/ghostwriternr)! - Add process isolation for sandbox commands

  Implements PID namespace isolation to protect control plane processes (Jupyter, Bun) from sandboxed code. Commands executed via `exec()` now run in isolated namespaces that cannot see or interact with system processes.

  **Key security improvements:**
  - Control plane processes are hidden from sandboxed commands
  - Platform secrets in `/proc/1/environ` are inaccessible
  - Ports 8888 (Jupyter) and 3000 (Bun) are protected from hijacking

  **Breaking changes:**
  1. **Removed `sessionId` parameter**: The `sessionId` parameter has been removed from all methods (`exec()`, `execStream()`, `startProcess()`, etc.). Each sandbox now maintains its own persistent session automatically.

     ```javascript
     // Before: manual session management
     await sandbox.exec('cd /app', { sessionId: 'my-session' });

     // After: automatic session per sandbox
     await sandbox.exec('cd /app');
     ```

  2. **Commands now maintain state**: Commands within the same sandbox now share state (working directory, environment variables, background processes). Previously each command was stateless.

     ```javascript
     // Before: each exec was independent
     await sandbox.exec('cd /app');
     await sandbox.exec('pwd'); // Output: /workspace

     // After: state persists in session
     await sandbox.exec('cd /app');
     await sandbox.exec('pwd'); // Output: /app
     ```

  **Migration guide:**
  - Remove `sessionId` from all method calls - each sandbox maintains its own session
  - If you need isolated execution contexts within the same sandbox, use `sandbox.createSession()`:
    ```javascript
    // Create independent sessions with different environments
    const buildSession = await sandbox.createSession({
      name: 'build',
      env: { NODE_ENV: 'production' },
      cwd: '/build'
    });
    const testSession = await sandbox.createSession({
      name: 'test',
      env: { NODE_ENV: 'test' },
      cwd: '/test'
    });
    ```
  - Environment variables set in one command persist to the next
  - Background processes remain active until explicitly killed
  - Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN (available in production, falls back gracefully in dev)
