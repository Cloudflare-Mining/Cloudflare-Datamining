# @cloudflare/voice-assemblyai

AssemblyAI streaming speech-to-text provider for the [Cloudflare Agents](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents) voice pipeline.

Uses AssemblyAI's real-time WebSocket API to transcribe audio continuously. A single session is created per call; the model handles turn detection and barge-in server-side. Targets [Universal 3.5 Pro Realtime](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-to-text/streaming) (`universal-3-5-pro`) — AssemblyAI's next-generation flagship real-time model, with 19 languages, improved prompting, and conversational context carryover.

## Install

```bash
npm install @cloudflare/voice-assemblyai
```

## Usage

Set `transcriber` on your voice agent:

```typescript
import { Agent } from "agents";
import {
  withVoice,
  WorkersAITTS,
  type VoiceTurnContext
} from "@cloudflare/voice";
import { AssemblyAISTT } from "@cloudflare/voice-assemblyai";

const VoiceAgent = withVoice(Agent);

export class MyAgent extends VoiceAgent<Env> {
  transcriber = new AssemblyAISTT({
    apiKey: this.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY
  });
  tts = new WorkersAITTS(this.env.AI);

  async onTurn(transcript: string, context: VoiceTurnContext) {
    // your LLM logic
  }
}
```

Provide the key as a Worker secret: `npx wrangler secret put ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`. Get a key from the [AssemblyAI dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/api-keys).

As the user speaks, the client receives `transcript_interim` messages — exposed by the `useVoiceAgent` React hook as `interimTranscript` — for a live transcript. These are stable partial segments (not word-by-word), kept flowing during long turns by `continuousPartials`.

## Conversational context (`agent_context`)

Universal 3.5 Pro Realtime carries prior finalized turns forward as context to improve accuracy on the next turn (`previousContextNTurns`, on by default). You can additionally feed it the agent's most recent spoken reply so it knows the question the user is answering — especially valuable for short replies (`"yes"`, `"7pm"`, a single name) and spelled-out entities (emails, account IDs). After the agent asks _"What's your email address?"_, this helps the model produce `"user@assemblyai.com"` instead of `"user at assemblyai dot com"`.

**The voice pipeline does this automatically.** After the agent finishes speaking each reply (and the opening greeting), `withVoice` calls the session's `updateAgentContext()` with the spoken text, which is sent to AssemblyAI as an `UpdateConfiguration` message mid-session. No extra wiring is required.

Setting `previousContextNTurns: 0` disables context carryover entirely, so the provider also skips the automatic `agent_context` updates.

Context works best when it is concise: AssemblyAI recommends trimming long agent replies down to the substantive question before sending, since shorter context values leave more room for prior turns.

You can also seed context at connection time with the `agentContext` option (e.g. for an opening line spoken before the user's first turn), or call `updateAgentContext()` yourself for custom integrations:

```typescript
const session = transcriber.createSession(options);
session.updateAgentContext?.("Sure — what date would you like to book?");
```

## How it works

1. When the call starts, a WebSocket session is opened to AssemblyAI (`speech_model=universal-3-5-pro`)
2. All audio chunks are forwarded continuously via `feed()` (16 kHz mono PCM). Frames smaller than AssemblyAI's 50 ms-per-message minimum (e.g. 20 ms telephony frames) are coalesced before sending
3. AssemblyAI emits `Turn` events — partials (`end_of_turn: false`) go to `onInterim`, the final transcript (`end_of_turn: true`) to `onUtterance`; `SpeechStarted` drives barge-in via `onSpeechStart`
4. The pipeline runs `onTurn()` with the stable transcript
5. After the agent speaks its reply, the pipeline calls `updateAgentContext()`, which sends an `UpdateConfiguration` with the spoken text so it primes the next user turn
6. On `close()`, a `Terminate` message is sent and the socket is closed promptly to end the billed session (streaming uses [session-based billing](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/streaming/getting-started/transcribe-streaming-audio))
