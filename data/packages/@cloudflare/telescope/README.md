# Telescope

`@cloudflare/telescope` — A cross-browser performance testing CLI and Node.js library built on Playwright.

## What it collects

When you run the agent, it will load the page in the browser you chose and apply any special parameters you have provided. By default, it will store results for the test in a `/results` directory. Each test gets its own folder with the date prefixed, followed by a unique ID.

> **Note:** Telescope injects an `x-telescope-id` header into every outgoing request during testing. This header carries a unique ID used to correlate timing data with HAR entries. It is sent to the target server and will be visible in the saved HAR file.

Inside the test folder, the following files are added:

- `console.json` - Console output from the page to look for warnings, JS errors, etc
- a video file showing the page load progression
- `metrics.json` - A collection of timing metrics collected from the browser during page load
- `pageload.har` - A har file of the page load
- `resources.json` - The resource timing API data for the page
- `screenshot.png` - A screenshot of the final page load
- `/filmstrip` - A collection of screenshots during the page load that could be used for a filmstrip

### Browser Support

Telescope uses Playwright to control and manage individual browser engines:

```
telescope -u https://www.example.com -b firefox
```

And supports the following browsers:

- [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/)
  - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - `chrome`
  - [Chrome Beta](https://www.google.com/chrome/beta/) - `chrome-beta`
  - [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) - `canary`
  - [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/) - `edge`
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)/[Webkit](https://webkit.org/) - `safari`
- [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/) - `firefox`

### Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout by passing the desired timeout in milliseconds using the `--timeout` parameter. Defaults to 30000, or 30 seconds.

```
telescope -u https://www.example.com -b chrome --timeout 50000
```

### HTML Report Generation

**Browser Support**
✅ Edge
✅ Chrome
✅ Safari
✅ Firefox

You can generate an HTML report of your test results by passing the `--html` parameter. To automatically open the report in your default browser after generation, add the `--openHtml` flag.

#### Generate HTML report

```
telescope -u https://example.com -b chrome --html
```

#### Generate and automatically open HTML report

```
telescope -u https://example.com -b chrome --html --openHtml
```

### Setting Custom Cookies

**Browser support**
✅ Edge
✅ Chrome
🚫 Safari
✅ Firefox

You can define custom cookies to be passed along to request when running your test using the `-c` or `--cookies` parameter.

Cookies must have a name and value passed. Optionally, you can also pass in either a URL or a domain and path. If none are passed, the script will default to using the test page url.

#### Set a custom cookie for all requests

```
telescope -u https://www.example.com -b chrome -c '{"name": "foo", "value": "bar"}'
```

#### Set multiple cookies for all requests

```
telescope -u https://www.example.com -b chrome -c '[{"name": "foo", "value": "bar"}, {"name": "foo2", "value": "bar2"}]'
```

#### Set a custom cookie for only a particular path

```
telescope -u https://www.example.com -b chrome -c '{"name": "foo", "value": "bar", "domain":"www.example.com", "path":"/optim"}'
```

### Disabling JavaScript

**Browser Support**
✅ Edge
✅ Chrome
✅ Safari
✅ Firefox

You can run tests with JavaScript disabled to see the impact on performance by passing the `--disableJS` parameter like so:

```
telescope -u https://playwright.dev/ -b firefox --disableJS
```

### Basic HTTP Authentication

**Browser Support**
✅ Edge
✅ Chrome
✅ Safari
✅ Firefox

To test sites [protected with HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication), you can pass the `--auth` parameter. It expects an object with a `username` and `password` like so:

```
telescope -u https://newsletter.www.example.com/admin -b safari --auth '{"username": "username", "password": "password"}'
```

### Host overrides

**Browser Support**
✅ Edge
✅ Chrome
✅ Safari
✅ Firefox (see note below)

To override hostnames during a test run, use the `--overrideHost` option with an object mapping between the host and how it should resolve to.

For example, you can cause requests to `cdn.example.com` to route to local web server running on port 8080 via:

```
telescope -u https://www.example.com -b firefox \
  --overrideHost '{"cdn.example.com": "127.0.0.1:8080"}'
```

Note: Firefox uses an HSTS preload list, which automatically upgrades requests prior to Playwright can intercept it. To work around this, you can disable the HSTS preload list with `--firefoxPrefs`:

```
telescope -u https://www.example.com -b firefox \
  --overrideHost '{"cdn.example.com": "127.0.0.1:8080"}' \
  --firefoxPrefs '{"network.stricttransportsecurity.preloadlist": false}'
```

## Docker

Build and run telescope in a container:

```bash
# Build
docker compose build

# Run a test
docker compose run --rm telescope -u https://example.com -b chrome

# Run with network throttling
docker compose run --rm telescope -u https://example.com -b chrome --connectionType 3g

# Results are saved to ./results/
```

Supports: Chrome, Chrome Beta, Edge, Firefox, and Safari (WebKit).

### Network Throttling Limitation

Network throttling (`--connectionType`) requires OS-level traffic shaping via the Linux `ifb` kernel module. This works on native Linux machines but **does not work in Docker Desktop (Mac or Windows)**, because the Docker Desktop Linux VM does not include the required kernel module.

## Installation

### Quick start

```bash
npm install -g @cloudflare/telescope
telescope -u https://example.com
```

The `postinstall` script automatically runs `npx playwright install` to download Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (~700MB, may take 2–5 minutes).

After `npm install -g`, the `telescope` command is on your PATH and can be invoked directly without `npx`. Verify with `which telescope` (Unix) or `where telescope` (Windows).

If you see `command not found: telescope`, your global npm `bin` directory isn't on PATH. Add it with:

```bash
export PATH="$(npm config get prefix)/bin:$PATH"
```

### From source

From the repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build -w packages/telescope
npm link                          # registers the `telescope` command globally
```

Or from `packages/telescope/` directly:

```bash
cd packages/telescope
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

### Browsers

### Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

Telescope's `postinstall` script automatically runs `npx playwright install` to install `chrome`, `firefox`, and `safari`. The download is ~700MB and may take 2–5 minutes.

If you skipped the postinstall (e.g. `npm install --ignore-scripts`), run it manually:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### Microsoft Edge and Chrome-beta

To install Microsoft Edge or Chrome Beta playwright requires root privileges and will not automatically install them, all you have to do that is to run `npx playwright install msedge chrome-beta` from the command line (and provide root password).

### Chrome Canary

Chrome Canary must be manually installed, please download and install from: https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/

### ffmpeg

Telescope uses `ffmpeg` to process the video and generate filmstrip images. You will need to have it installed on your machine.

For MacOS you can use `homebrew` to install it:

```
brew install ffmpeg
```

## Programmatic Usage

You can run telescope from within a Node.js script:

```javascript
import { launchTest } from '@cloudflare/telescope';

const result = await launchTest({
  url: 'https://example.com',
  browser: 'chrome',
  width: 1920,
  height: 1080,
  timeout: 60000,
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Test completed: ${result.testId}`);
  console.log(`Results saved to: ${result.resultsPath}`);
} else {
  console.error(`Test failed: ${result.error}`);
}
```

All CLI options are supported as object properties. See Parameters section for available options.

## Contributing To This Project

Commands below can be run from `packages/telescope/` directly, or from the repo root using workspace shortcuts (see root `README.md`).

### Running Automated Tests

To run automated code tests in this project, you can use the following command:

```
npm run test
```

#### Using Specific Browsers

You can run tests with [specific browsers](#browser-support) by setting the `BROWSERS` environment variable. For example, to run tests with Chrome and Firefox, you can run:

```
BROWSERS=chrome,firefox npm run test
```

The same browser can be listed more than once; each occurrence will run as a separate test pass. This can be useful for debugging side effects of running multiple tests on the same browser or just long tests.

Note: `BROWSERS` environment variable is ignored when [running in CI](#our-ci-pipeline).

#### Running Tests In Headless Mode

You can run tests in headless mode by setting the `HEADLESS` environment variable to `true`. For example:

```
HEADLESS=true npm run test
```

#### Our CI Pipeline

Our CI pipeline is set up to run tests on every push to the repository so you can see results in your pull request.

At this point, to limit the length of the tests and (to simplify compatibility with GitHub Actions) it runs tests in headless mode on `firefox` only.

If you want to run the same configuration locally, you can run `CI=true npm test`. You can override the default headless CI mode by setting the `HEADLESS` environment variable to `false`. However, you can't override the set of browsers that the CI configuration runs (it will always run `firefox` only).
