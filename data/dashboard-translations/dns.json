Create an A, AAAA or CNAME record on the name `www` in the Cloudflare DNS app and change the Proxy Status to Proxied. \n2. Then add a CNAME record on `www.%{zone}` in your authoritative DNS and point it to `www.%{zone}.%{suffix}`.\n\nRepeat this for other subdomains of `%{zone}` that you want to proxy to Cloudflare.\n\nFor more details, see [Understanding a CNAME Setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup).",
