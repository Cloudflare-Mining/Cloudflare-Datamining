Check your domain TLD is supported**\n\nRegistrar only supports specific Top Level Domains (TLD). <a href='https://www.cloudflare.com/tld-policies/' target='_blank'>Visit TLD Policies</a> - if your TLD is not listed as available, you cannot use Cloudflare as your domain Registrar at this time. Cloudflare Support is unable to confirm when a specific TLD will go live.\n\n\n\n**2. Check your domain name is supported**\n\n\n\n*Registrar does not support Premium domains*. To check if your domain is premium, enter your domain into <a href='https://domains.google.com/registrar/search' target='_blank'>Google Domains Search</a> - if you see the Premium label, you cannot use Cloudflare as your domain Registrar at this time.\n\n\n\n*Registrar does not support Internalionalisted Domain Names (IDNs).* Does your domain name start with `xn--`? Currently, Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs) are not supported and you cannot use Cloudflare as your domain Registrar at this time.\n\n\n\n**3. Check the domain expiry**\n\n\n\nIf your domain is due to expire within 15 days (or within 10 days for `.uk` TLDs), you must first renew the domain at your current domain registrar. Once you have done this, you can then transfer to Cloudflare Registrar.\n\n\n\n**4. Check the domain is Active with Cloudflare**\n\n\n\nThe domain must be added to your Cloudflare account already and have a status of u201CActiveu201D. Visit the <a href='https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/' target='_blank'>Dashboard</a> - if you do not see `Active` underneath your domain name, click the domain name and follow the on screen instructions. Once the domain is Active, you can start the Registrar transfer process with Cloudflare.\n\n\n\n**5. Check the domain's WHOIS status**\n\n\n\nVisit a WHOIS service such as <a href='https://who.is' target='_blank'>who.is</a> and check the Status field. You will not be able to start a transfer to another Registrar if you see any of the following listed:\n\n\n\n* clientTransferProhibited\n\n* serverTransferProhibited\n\n* serverHold\n\n\n\nYou must contact your current Registrar to ensure these statuses are removed before you can start a transfer to Cloudflare Registrar.\n\n\n\n**6. Check you have a valid credit card on file**\n\n\n\nVisit <a href='https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/billing/payment-info' target='_blank'>Payment info</a> and ensure a working payment method is entered.\n\nYou should also review our Registrar <a href='https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/' target='_blank'>Get Started</a> guide and <a href='https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/faq/' target='_blank'>FAQ</a>.\n\nNote: Our Registrar support team can only assist if all of the above have been checked by you. If all of these checks look good and you still see `transfer conditions not met` and cannot start the transfer process, please close this and click the `Add more details` to raise a ticket with the Cloudflare Support team.\n\n",
