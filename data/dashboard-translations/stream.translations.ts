**Processing: Free**
You get multi-bit rate encoding at no cost.

**Player: Free**
You get a reliable and fully customizable player with your own branding at no cost.

**Storage: $5.00 per 1,000 minutes (prepaid)**
You only pay for the length of your original video. Example: Even if your 10-minute video is encoded into 6 different bit rates, you will only pay for 10 minutes (instead of 60 minutes).

**Streaming: $1.00 per 1,000 minutes (postpaid)**
You will only be billed each month based on how many minutes you stream. If you plan to stream more than 1M minutes per month, please [contact](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/contact/) our Enterprise Team for discounted pricing.`
