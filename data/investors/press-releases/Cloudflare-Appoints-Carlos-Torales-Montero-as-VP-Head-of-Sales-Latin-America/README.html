		Cloudflare first invested in Latin America in 2014, expanding its network into the region by establishing a data center in Santiago, Chile. Today, Cloudflare’s global network spans more than 270 cities in more than 100 countries, including 36 cities across Latin America. Building upon its robust in-region network and partnerships, Cloudflare is planning to further expand in Latin America and continues to grow its network footprint to connect users and organizations globally.

		“There is a significant online market in Latin America, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statista.com%2Fstatistics%2F265147%2Fnumber-of-worldwide-internet-users-by-region%2F&amp;esheet=52710437&amp;newsitemid=20220506005086&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=representing+nearly+500+million+Internet+users&amp;index=2&amp;md5=d032b35fd92c499db606cedf5b550ed5" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">representing nearly 500 million Internet users</a>. For years, Latin America has been driving consistent and strong Internet use, being the fourth largest region in terms of users online worldwide,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder &amp; CEO of Cloudflare. “Latin America has always been a priority for Cloudflare, establishing our network in the region early on and we have been expanding ever since. We’ll be continuing this growth, with Carlos leading our efforts, to work even closer with our growing and expanding Latin American customer base.”

		“The Internet is heavily relied on in Latin America and we have been seeing a huge digital transformation acceleration. At the same time, there has been an increase in cyber threats for organizations of all types and sizes. At the end of last year, Cloudflare’s network blocked an average of nearly seven billion attacks per day in Latin America,” said Carlos Torales Montero, Vice President, Head of Sales, Latin America at Cloudflare. “The power and scale of Cloudflare’s network enables us to provide an extremely tailored yet seamless security and performance platform to any Latin America organization. I look forward to being part of equipping more and more customers, and our partners, with the tools that are critical to any business today.”

		“TIVIT positions itself in the market as a one stop shop company, which is present in ten Latin American countries and supports large customers to solve their business challenges.
